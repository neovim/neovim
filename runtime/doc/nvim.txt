                            NVIM REFERENCE MANUAL


Nvim                                                       *nvim* *nvim-intro*

Nvim is based on Vim by Bram Moolenaar.

If you already use Vim see |nvim-from-vim| for a quickstart.
If you are new to Vim, try the 30-minute tutorial: >

Nvim is emphatically a fork of Vim, not a clone: compatibility with Vim
(especially editor and Vimscript features) is maintained where possible. See
|vim-differences| for the complete reference of differences from Vim.

                                      Type |gO| to see the table of contents.

Transitioning from Vim                          *nvim-from-vim*

1. To start the transition, create your |init.vim| (user config) file: >

    :call mkdir(stdpath('config'), 'p')
    :exe 'edit '.stdpath('config').'/init.vim'

2. Add these contents to the file: >

    set runtimepath^=~/.vim runtimepath+=~/.vim/after
    let &packpath = &runtimepath
    source ~/.vimrc

3. Restart Nvim, your existing Vim config will be loaded.

See |provider-python| and |provider-clipboard| for additional software you
might need to use some features.

Your Vim configuration might not be entirely Nvim-compatible (see
|vim-differences|). For example the |'ttymouse'| option was removed from Nvim,
because mouse support is always enabled if possible. If you use the same
|vimrc| for Vim and Nvim you could guard |'ttymouse'| in your configuration
like so:
>
    if !has('nvim')
        set ttymouse=xterm2
    endif

And for Nvim-specific configuration, you can do this:
>
    if has('nvim')
        tnoremap <Esc> <C-\><C-n>
    endif

For a more granular approach use |exists()|:
>
    if exists(':tnoremap')
        tnoremap <Esc> <C-\><C-n>
    endif

Now you should be able to explore Nvim more comfortably. Check |nvim-features|
for more information.

                                                        *portable-config*
Because Nvim follows the XDG |base-directories| standard, configuration on
Windows is stored in ~/AppData instead of ~/.config. But you can still share
the same Nvim configuration on all of your machines, by creating
~/AppData/Local/nvim/init.vim containing just this line: >
    source ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
