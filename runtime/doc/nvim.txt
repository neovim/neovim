			    NVIM REFERENCE MANUAL


Nvim							   *nvim* *nvim-intro*

Nvim is based on Vim by Bram Moolenaar.

If you are new to Vim see |help.txt|, or type ":Tutor".
If you already use Vim see |nvim-from-vim| for a quickstart.

Nvim is emphatically a fork of Vim, not a clone: compatibility with Vim is
maintained where possible. See |vim_diff.txt| for the complete reference of
differences from Vim.

==============================================================================
Transitioning from Vim				*nvim-from-vim*

To start the transition, create init.vim in the correct directory for your
platform.

For Linux, macOS and other Unixes, create the file at ~/.config/nvim/init.vim.

For Windows, create the file at %LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim\init.vim. `%LOCALAPPDATA%`
usually expands to `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local`.

Note: If your system sets `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, use that instead of `~/.config`
or `%LOCALAPPDATA%` in the paths above. Nvim follows the XDG |base-directories|
convention.

Next, add these contents to the file:
>
    set runtimepath^=~/.vim runtimepath+=~/.vim/after
    let &packpath = &runtimepath
    source ~/.vimrc
<
See |provider-python| and |provider-clipboard| for additional software you
might need to use some features.

Your Vim configuration might not be entirely compatible with Nvim. For a
full list of differences between Vim and Nvim see |vim-differences|.

The |'ttymouse'| option, for example, was removed from Nvim (mouse support
should work without it). If you use the same |vimrc| for Vim and Nvim,
consider guarding |'ttymouse'| in your configuration like so:
>
    if !has('nvim')
        set ttymouse=xterm2
    endif
<
Conversely, if you have Nvim specific configuration items, you could do
this:
>
    if has('nvim')
        tnoremap <Esc> <C-\><C-n>
    endif
<
For a more granular approach use |exists()|:
>
    if exists(':tnoremap')
        tnoremap <Esc> <C-\><C-n>
    endif
<
Now you should be able to explore Nvim more comfortably. Check |nvim-features|
for more information.
