			    NVIM REFERENCE MANUAL


Nvim						*nvim* *nvim-intro*

If you are new to Vim (and Nvim) see |help.txt| or type ":Tutor".
If you already use Vim (but not Nvim) see |nvim-from-vim| for a quickstart.

Nvim is emphatically a fork of Vim, not a clone: compatibility with Vim is
maintained where possible. See |vim_diff.txt| for the complete reference of
differences from Vim.

==============================================================================
Transitioning from Vim				*nvim-from-vim*

To start the transition, link your previous configuration so Nvim can use it:
>
    mkdir ~/.config
    ln -s ~/.vim ~/.config/nvim
    ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
<
Note: If your system sets `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, use that instead of `~/.config`
in the code above. Nvim follows the XDG |base-directories| convention.

See |provider-python| and |provider-clipboard| for additional software you
might need to use some features.

Your Vim configuration might not be entirely compatible with Nvim. For a
full list of differences between Vim and Nvim see |vim-differences|.

The |'ttymouse'| option, for example, was removed from Nvim (mouse support
should work without it). If you use the same |vimrc| for Vim and Nvim,
consider guarding |'ttymouse'| in your configuration like so:
>
    if !has('nvim')
        set ttymouse=xterm2
    endif
<
Conversely, if you have Nvim specific configuration items, you could do
this:
>
    if has('nvim')
        tnoremap <Esc> <C-\><C-n>
    endif
<
For a more granular approach use |exists()|:
>
    if exists(':tnoremap')
        tnoremap <Esc> <C-\><C-n>
    endif
<
Now you should be able to explore Nvim more comfortably. Check |nvim-features|
for more information.
