==============================================================================
BREAKING CHANGES

The following changes may require adaptations in user config or plugins.

• Cscope support is now removed (see |cscope| and |nvim-removed|):
  - Commands removed:
    - `:cscope`
    - `:lcscope`
    - `:scscope`
    - `:cstag`
  - Options removed:
    - `cscopepathcomp`
    - `cscopeprg`
    - `cscopequickfix`
    - `cscoperelative`
    - `cscopetag`
    - `cscopetagorder`
    - `cscopeverbose`
  - Eval functions removed:
    - `cscope_connection()`

  Note: support for |ctags| remains with no plans to remove.

  See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/20545 for more information.

• `:hardcopy` is now removed (see |hardcopy| and |nvim-removed|):
  - Commands removed:
    - `:hardcopy`
  - Options removed:
    - `printdevice`
    - `printencoding`
    - `printexpr`
    - `printfont`
    - `printheader`
    - `printmbcharset`

• 'paste' option is now deprecated and 'pastetoggle' is removed. |paste| works
  automatically in GUI and terminal (TUI) Nvim.  Just Paste It.™

• Changes to |vim.treesitter.get_node_text()|:
  - It now returns `string`, as opposed to `string|string[]|nil`.
  - The `concat` option has been removed as it was not consistently applied.
  - Invalid ranges now cause an error instead of returning `nil`.

• `help` treesitter parser was renamed to `vimdoc`. The only user-visible
  change is that language-specific highlight groups need to be renamed from
  `@foo.help` to `@foo.vimdoc`.

• The default value of 'commentstring' is now empty instead of "/*%s*/".

• libiconv and intl are now required build dependencies.

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES

The following new APIs or features were added.

• Treesitter syntax highlighting for `help` files now supports highlighted
  code examples. To enable, create a `.config/nvim/ftplugin/help.lua` with
  the contents >lua
    vim.treesitter.start()
<
  Note: Highlighted code examples are only available in the Nvim manual, not
  in help files taken from Vim. The treesitter `vimdoc` parser is also work in
  progress and not guaranteed to correctly highlight every help file in the
  wild.

• Added support for semantic token highlighting to the LSP client. This
  functionality is enabled by default when a client that supports this feature
  is attached to a buffer. Opt-out can be performed by deleting the
  `semanticTokensProvider` from the LSP client's {server_capabilities} in the
  `LspAttach` callback.

  See |lsp-semantic-highlight| for more information.

• |vim.inspect_pos()|, |vim.show_pos()| and |:Inspect| allow a user to get or show items
  at a given buffer position. Currently this includes treesitter captures,
  LSP semantic tokens, syntax groups and extmarks.

• |vim.treesitter.inspect_tree()| and |:InspectTree| opens a split window
  showing a text representation of the nodes in a language tree for the current
  buffer.

• |'statuscolumn'| option to customize the area to the side of a window,
  normally containing the fold, sign and number columns. This new option follows
  the 'statusline' syntax and can be used to transform the line numbers, create
  mouse click callbacks for |signs|, introduce a custom margin or separator etc.

• |vim.secure.trust()|, |:trust| allows the user to manage files in trust database.
  |vim.secure.read()| reads a file and prompts the user if it should be
  trusted and, if so, returns the file's contents.  Used by 'exrc'

• EditorConfig support is now builtin. This is enabled by default and happens
  automatically. To disable it, users should add >lua

    vim.g.editorconfig = false
<
  (or the Vimscript equivalent) to their |config| file.

• A new environment variable named NVIM_APPNAME enables configuring the
  directories where Nvim should find its configuration and state files. See
  `:help $NVIM_APPNAME` .

• Added support for running Lua scripts from shell using |-l|. >
      nvim -l foo.lua --arg1 --arg2
<  Also works with stdin: >
      echo "print(42)" | nvim -l -

• Added an omnifunc implementation for Lua, |vim.lua_omnifunc()|

• Added a new experimental |vim.loader| that byte-compiles and caches Lua files.
  To enable the new loader, add the following at the top of your |init.lua|: >lua
    vim.loader.enable()

• Added |vim.version| for parsing and comparing version strings conforming to
  the semver specification.

• When using Nvim inside tmux 3.2 or later, the default clipboard provider
  will now copy to the system clipboard. |provider-clipboard|

• |'showcmdloc'| option to display the 'showcmd' information in the
  status line or tab line. A new %S statusline item is available to place
  the 'showcmd' text in a custom 'statusline'. Useful for when |'cmdheight'|
  is set to 0.

• |'splitkeep'| option to control the scroll behavior of horizontal splits.

• |'diffopt'| now includes a `linematch` option to enable a second-stage diff
  on individual hunks to provide much more accurate diffs. This option is also
  available to |vim.diff()|

  See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/14537.

• |--remote-ui| option was added to connect to a remote instance and display
  in it in a |TUI| in the local terminal. This can be used run a headless nvim
  instance in the background and display its UI on demand, which previously
  only was possible using an external UI implementation.

• Added a |vim.lsp.codelens.clear()| function to clear codelenses.

• Added support for the `willSave` and `willSaveWaitUntil` capabilities to the
  LSP client. `willSaveWaitUntil` allows a server to modify a document before it
  gets saved. Example use-cases by language servers include removing unused
  imports, or formatting the file.

• Added preliminary support for the `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` capability
  to the LSP client to notify servers of file changes on disk. The feature is
  disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the
  `workspace.didChangeWatchedFiles.dynamicRegistration=true` capability.

• |vim.diagnostic| now supports LSP DiagnosticsTag.
  See: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#diagnosticTag

• vim.diagnostic.is_disabled() checks if diagnostics are disabled in a given
  buffer or namespace.

• Treesitter captures can now be transformed by directives. This will allow
  more complicated dynamic language injections.

• |vim.treesitter.get_node_text()| now accepts a `metadata` option for
  writing custom directives using |vim.treesitter.query.add_directive()|.

• |vim.treesitter.language.add()| replaces `vim.treesitter.language.require_language`.

• |vim.treesitter.foldexpr()| can be used for 'foldexpr' to use treesitter for folding.

• Expanded the TSNode API with:
  - |TSNode:tree()|
  - |TSNode:has_changes()|
  - |TSNode:extra()|
  - |TSNode:equal()|

  Additionally |TSNode:range()| now takes an optional {include_bytes} argument.

• Treesitter injection queries now use the format described at
  https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/syntax-highlighting#language-injection .
  Support for the previous format will be removed in a future release.

• Added |nvim_get_hl()| for getting highlight group definitions in a format
  compatible with |nvim_set_hl()|.

• |vim.filetype.get_option()| to get the default option value for a specific
  filetype. This is a wrapper around |nvim_get_option_value()| with caching.

• `require'bit'` is now always available |lua-bit|

==============================================================================
CHANGED FEATURES

The following changes to existing APIs or features add new behavior.

• 'exrc' now supports `.nvim.lua` file.
• 'exrc' is no longer marked deprecated.

• The |TUI| is changed to run in a separate process (previously, a separate
  thread was used). This is not supposed to be a visible change to the user,
  but might be the cause of subtle changes of behavior and bugs.

  Previously, the TUI could be disabled as a build time feature (+tui/-tui),
  resulting in a nvim binary which only could be run headless or embedded
  in an external process. As of this version, TUI is always available.

• Vim's `has('gui_running')` is now supported as a way for plugins to check if
  a GUI (not the |TUI|) is attached to Nvim. |has()|

• |msgsep| is now always enabled even if 'display' doesn't contain the "msgsep"
  flag. It is no longer possible to scroll the whole screen when showing
  messages longer than 'cmdheight'.

• API calls now show more information about where an exception happened.

• The `win_viewport` UI event now contains information about virtual lines,
  meaning that smooth scrolling can now be implemented more consistently.

• The `:= {expr}` syntax can be used to evaluate a Lua expression, as
  a shorter form of `:lua ={expr}`. `:=` and `:[range]=` without argument
  are unchanged. However `:=#` and similar variants using |ex-flags|
  are no longer supported.

• Unsaved changes are now preserved rather than discarded when |channel-stdio|
  is closed.

• |nvim_open_win()| now accepts a relative `mouse` option to open a floating win
  relative to the mouse. Note that the mouse doesn't update frequently without
  setting `vim.o.mousemoveevent = true`

• |nvim_eval_statusline()| supports evaluating the |'statuscolumn'| through a
  new `opts` field: `use_statuscol_lnum`.

• |nvim_buf_get_extmarks()| now accepts a -1 `ns_id` to request extmarks from
  all namespaces and adds the namespace id to the details array.
  Other missing properties have been added to the details array and marks can
  be filtered by type.

• |vim.diagnostic.open_float()| (and therefore |vim.diagnostic.config()|) now
  accepts a `suffix` option which, by default, renders LSP error codes.
  Similarly, the `virtual_text` configuration in |vim.diagnostic.config()| now
  has a `suffix` option which does nothing by default.

• |vim.fs.dir()| now has a `opts` argument with a depth field to allow
  recursively searching a directory tree.

• |vim.gsplit()| supports all features of |vim.split()|.

• |:highlight| now supports an additional attribute "altfont".

• |:Man| manpage viewer supports manpage names containing spaces.

• |nvim_select_popupmenu_item()| now supports |cmdline-completion| popup menu.

• |nvim_list_uis()| reports all |ui-option| fields.

• |nvim_get_option_value()| now has a `filetype` option so it can return the
  default option for a specific filetype.

• build: Several improvements were made to make the code generation scripts more
  deterministic, and a `LUA_GEN_PRG` build parameter has been introduced to
  allow for a workaround for some remaining reproducibility problems.

==============================================================================
REMOVED FEATURES

The following deprecated functions or APIs were removed.

• `filetype.vim` is removed in favor of |vim.filetype|
  (Note that filetype logic and tests still align with Vim, so additions or
  changes need to be contributed there first.)
  See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/20674.

• 'hkmap', 'hkmapp' and 'aleph' options were removed. Use 'keymap' option instead.

• |LanguageTree:parse()| no longer returns changed regions. Please use the
  `on_changedtree` callbacks instead.

• `vim.highlight.create()`, `vim.highlight.link()` were removed, use |nvim_set_hl()| instead.

• `require'health'` was removed. Use |vim.health| instead.
