==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION							  *hare-intro*

This plugin provides syntax highlighting, indentation, and other functionality
for the Hare programming language. Support is also provided for README files
inside Hare modules, but this must be enabled by setting |g:filetype_haredoc|.

==============================================================================
FILETYPE PLUGIN							 *hare-plugin*

This plugin automatically sets the value of 'path' to include the contents of
the HAREPATH environment variable, allowing commands such as |gf| to directly
open standard library or third-party modules. If HAREPATH is not set, it
defaults to the recommended paths for most Unix-like filesystems, namely
/usr/src/hare/stdlib and /usr/src/hare/third-party.

==============================================================================
SETTINGS						       *hare-settings*

This plugin provides a small number of variables that you can define in your
vimrc to configure its behavior.

							  *g:filetype_haredoc*
This plugin is able to automatically detect Hare modules and set the "haredoc"
filetype for any README files. As the recursive directory search used as a
heuristic has a minor performance impact, this feature is disabled by default
and must be specifically opted into: >
	let g:filetype_haredoc = 1
<
See |g:haredoc_search_depth| for ways to tweak the searching behavior.

						    *g:hare_recommended_style*
The following options are set by default, in accordance with the official Hare
style guide: >
	setlocal noexpandtab
	setlocal shiftwidth=0
	setlocal softtabstop=0
	setlocal tabstop=8
	setlocal textwidth=80
<
To disable this behavior: >
	let g:hare_recommended_style = 0
<
							  *g:hare_space_error*
By default, trailing whitespace and tabs preceded by space characters are
highlighted as errors. This is automatically turned off when in insert mode.
To disable this highlighting completely: >
	let g:hare_space_error = 0
<
						      *g:haredoc_search_depth*
By default, when |g:filetype_haredoc| is enabled, only the current directory
and its immediate subdirectories are searched for Hare files. The maximum
search depth may be adjusted with: >
	let g:haredoc_search_depth = 2
<
	Value		Effect~
	0		Only search the current directory.
	1		Search the current directory and immediate
			subdirectories.
	2		Search the current directory and two levels of
			subdirectories.

The maximum search depth can be set to any integer, but using values higher
than 2 is not recommended, and will likely provide no tangible benefit in most
situations.
