This file documents the Lua bindings for the LibUV library which is used for
Nvim's event-loop and is accessible from Lua via |vim.uv| (e.g., |uv.version()|
is exposed as `vim.uv.version()`).

INTRODUCTION                                                  *luv* *luv-intro* *uv*

The luv (https://github.com/luvit/luv) project provides access to the
multi-platform support library libuv (https://github.com/libuv/libuv) in Lua
code. It was primarily developed for the luvit
(https://github.com/luvit/luvit) project as the built-in `uv` module, but can
be used in other Lua environments.

More information about the core libuv library can be found at the original
libuv documentation page (https://docs.libuv.org/).

TCP Echo Server Example ~

Here is a small example showing a TCP echo server:

    >lua
    local uv = vim.uv

    local server = uv.new_tcp()
    server:bind("127.0.0.1", 1337)
    server:listen(128, function (err)
      assert(not err, err)
      local client = uv.new_tcp()
      server:accept(client)
      client:read_start(function (err, chunk)
        assert(not err, err)
        if chunk then
          client:write(chunk)
        else
          client:shutdown()
          client:close()
        end
      end)
    end)
    print("TCP server listening at 127.0.0.1 port 1337")
    uv.run() -- an explicit run call is necessary outside of luvit
<

Module Layout ~

The luv library contains a single Lua module referred to hereafter as `uv` for
simplicity. This module consists mostly of functions with names corresponding
to their original libuv versions. For example, the libuv function
`uv_tcp_bind` has a luv version at |uv.tcp_bind()|. Currently, only two
non-function fields exists: `uv.constants` and `uv.errno`, which are tables.

Functions vs Methods ~

In addition to having simple functions, luv provides an optional method-style
API. For example, `uv.tcp_bind(server, host, port)` can alternatively be
called as `server:bind(host, port)` . Note that the first argument `server`
becomes the object and `tcp_` is removed from the function name. Method forms
are documented below where they exist.

Synchronous vs Asynchronous Functions ~

Functions that accept a callback are asynchronous. These functions may
immediately return results to the caller to indicate their initial status, but
their final execution is deferred until at least the next libuv loop
iteration. After completion, their callbacks are executed with any results
passed to it.

Functions that do not accept a callback are synchronous. These functions
immediately return their results to the caller.

Some (generally FS and DNS) functions can behave either synchronously or
asynchronously. If a callback is provided to these functions, they behave
asynchronously; if no callback is provided, they behave synchronously.

Pseudo-Types ~

Some unique types are defined. These are not actual types in Lua, but they are
used here to facilitate documenting consistent behavior:
- `fail`: an assertable `nil, string, string` tuple (see |luv-error-handling|)
- `callable`: a `function`; or a `table` or `userdata` with a `__call`
  metamethod
- `buffer`: a `string` or a sequential `table` of `string`s
- `threadargs`: variable arguments (`...`) of type `nil`, `boolean`, `number`,
  `string`, or `userdata`; number of arguments limited to 9.

CONSTANTS                                                        *luv-constants*

As a Lua library, luv supports and encourages the use of lowercase strings to
represent options. For example:
>lua
  -- signal start with string input
  uv.signal_start("sigterm", function(signame)
    print(signame) -- string output: "sigterm"
  end)
<
However, luv also superficially exposes libuv constants in a Lua table at
`uv.constants` where its keys are uppercase constant names and their associated
values are integers defined internally by libuv. The values from this table may
be supported as function arguments, but their use may not change the output
type. For example:
>lua
  -- signal start with integer input
  uv.signal_start(uv.constants.SIGTERM, function(signame)
    print(signame) -- string output: "sigterm"
  end)
<

==============================================================================
ERROR HANDLING                                              *luv-error-handling*

In libuv, errors are represented by negative numbered constants. While these
constants are made available in the `uv.errno` table, they are not returned by
luv functions and the libuv functions used to handle them are not exposed.
Instead, if an internal error is encountered, the failing luv function will
return to the caller an assertable `nil, err, name` tuple:

- `nil` idiomatically indicates failure
- `err` is a string with the format `{name}: {message}`
  - `{name}` is the error name provided internally by `uv_err_name`
  - `{message}` is a human-readable message provided internally by
    `uv_strerror`
- `name` is the same string used to construct `err`

This tuple is referred to below as the `fail` pseudo-type.

When a function is called successfully, it will return either a value that is
relevant to the operation of the function, or the integer `0` to indicate
success, or sometimes nothing at all. These cases are documented below.

`uv.errno`                                                              *uv.errno*

==============================================================================
VERSION CHECKING                                          *luv-version-checking*

uv.version()                                                      *uv.version()*

                Returns the libuv version packed into a single integer. 8 bits
                are used for each component, with the patch number stored in
                the 8 least significant bits. For example, this would be
                0x010203 in libuv 1.2.3.

                Returns: `integer`

uv.version_string()                                        *uv.version_string()*

                Returns the libuv version number as a string. For example,
                this would be "1.2.3" in libuv 1.2.3. For non-release
                versions, the version suffix is included.

                Returns: `string`

==============================================================================
`uv_loop_t` — Event loop                                *luv-event-loop* *uv_loop_t*

The event loop is the central part of libuv's functionality. It takes care of
polling for I/O and scheduling callbacks to be run based on different sources
of events.

In luv, there is an implicit uv loop for every Lua state that loads the
library. You can use this library in an multi-threaded environment as long as
each thread has it's own Lua state with its corresponding own uv loop. This
loop is not directly exposed to users in the Lua module.

uv.loop_close()                                                *uv.loop_close()*

                Closes all internal loop resources. In normal execution, the
                loop will automatically be closed when it is garbage collected
                by Lua, so it is not necessary to explicitly call
                `loop_close()`. Call this function only after the loop has
                finished executing and all open handles and requests have been
                closed, or it will return `EBUSY`.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.run([{mode}])                                                      *uv.run()*

                Parameters:
                - `mode`: `string` or `nil` (default: `"default"`)

                This function runs the event loop. It will act differently
                depending on the specified mode:

                  - `"default"`: Runs the event loop until there are no more
                    active and referenced handles or requests. Returns `true`
                    if |uv.stop()| was called and there are still active
                    handles or requests. Returns `false` in all other cases.

                  - `"once"`: Poll for I/O once. Note that this function
                    blocks if there are no pending callbacks. Returns `false`
                    when done (no active handles or requests left), or `true`
                    if more callbacks are expected (meaning you should run the
                    event loop again sometime in the future).

                  - `"nowait"`: Poll for I/O once but don't block if there are
                    no pending callbacks. Returns `false` if done (no active
                    handles or requests left), or `true` if more callbacks are
                    expected (meaning you should run the event loop again
                    sometime in the future).

                Returns: `boolean` or `fail`

                Note: Luvit will implicitly call `uv.run()` after loading user
                code, but if you use the luv bindings directly, you need to
                call this after registering your initial set of event
                callbacks to start the event loop.

uv.loop_configure({option}, {...})                         *uv.loop_configure()*

                Parameters:
                - `option`: `string`
                - `...`: depends on `option`, see below

                Set additional loop options. You should normally call this
                before the first call to uv_run() unless mentioned otherwise.

                Supported options:

                  - `"block_signal"`: Block a signal when polling for new
                    events. The second argument to loop_configure() is the
                    signal name (as a lowercase string) or the signal number.
                    This operation is currently only implemented for
                    `"sigprof"` signals, to suppress unnecessary wakeups when
                    using a sampling profiler. Requesting other signals will
                    fail with `EINVAL`.
                  - `"metrics_idle_time"`: Accumulate the amount of idle time
                    the event loop spends in the event provider. This option
                    is necessary to use `metrics_idle_time()`.

                An example of a valid call to this function is:

                    >lua
                    uv.loop_configure("block_signal", "sigprof")
<

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

                Note: Be prepared to handle the `ENOSYS` error; it means the
                loop option is not supported by the platform.

uv.loop_mode()                                                  *uv.loop_mode()*

                If the loop is running, returns a string indicating the mode
                in use. If the loop is not running, `nil` is returned instead.

                Returns: `string` or `nil`

uv.loop_alive()                                                *uv.loop_alive()*

                Returns `true` if there are referenced active handles, active
                requests, or closing handles in the loop; otherwise, `false`.

                Returns: `boolean` or `fail`

uv.stop()                                                            *uv.stop()*

                Stop the event loop, causing |uv.run()| to end as soon as
                possible. This will happen not sooner than the next loop
                iteration. If this function was called before blocking for
                I/O, the loop won't block for I/O on this iteration.

                Returns: Nothing.

uv.backend_fd()                                                *uv.backend_fd()*

                Get backend file descriptor. Only kqueue, epoll, and event
                ports are supported.

                This can be used in conjunction with `uv.run("nowait")` to
                poll in one thread and run the event loop's callbacks in
                another

                Returns: `integer` or `nil`

                Note: Embedding a kqueue fd in another kqueue pollset doesn't
                work on all platforms. It's not an error to add the fd but it
                never generates events.

uv.backend_timeout()                                      *uv.backend_timeout()*

                Get the poll timeout. The return value is in milliseconds, or
                -1 for no timeout.

                Returns: `integer`

uv.now()                                                              *uv.now()*

                Returns the current timestamp in milliseconds. The timestamp
                is cached at the start of the event loop tick, see
                |uv.update_time()| for details and rationale.

                The timestamp increases monotonically from some arbitrary
                point in time. Don't make assumptions about the starting
                point, you will only get disappointed.

                Returns: `integer`

                Note: Use |uv.hrtime()| if you need sub-millisecond
                granularity.

uv.update_time()                                              *uv.update_time()*

                Update the event loop's concept of "now". Libuv caches the
                current time at the start of the event loop tick in order to
                reduce the number of time-related system calls.

                You won't normally need to call this function unless you have
                callbacks that block the event loop for longer periods of
                time, where "longer" is somewhat subjective but probably on

`uv_handle_t` — Base handle                          *luv-base-handle* *uv_handle_t*

`uv_handle_t` is the base type for all libuv handle types. All API functions
defined here work with any handle type.

uv.is_active({handle})                                          *uv.is_active()*

                > method form `handle:is_active()`

                Parameters:
                - `handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_handle_t|

                Returns `true` if the handle is active, `false` if it's
                inactive. What "active” means depends on the type of handle:

                  - A |uv_async_t| handle is always active and cannot be
                    deactivated, except by closing it with |uv.close()|.

                  - A |uv_pipe_t|, |uv_tcp_t|, |uv_udp_t|, etc.
                    handle - basically any handle that deals with I/O - is
                    active when it is doing something that involves I/O, like
                    reading, writing, connecting, accepting new connections,
                    etc.

                  - A |uv_check_t|, |uv_idle_t|, |uv_timer_t|,
                    etc. handle is active when it has been started with a call
                    to |uv.check_start()|, |uv.idle_start()|,
                    |uv.timer_start()| etc. until it has been stopped with a
                    call to its respective stop function.

                Returns: `boolean` or `fail`

uv.is_closing({handle})                                        *uv.is_closing()*

                > method form `handle:is_closing()`

                Parameters:
                - `handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_handle_t|

                Returns `true` if the handle is closing or closed, `false`
                otherwise.

                Returns: `boolean` or `fail`

                Note: This function should only be used between the
                initialization of the handle and the arrival of the close
                callback.

uv.close({handle} [, {callback}])                                   *uv.close()*

                > method form `handle:close([callback])`

                Parameters:
                - `handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_handle_t|
                - `callback`: `callable` or `nil`

                Request handle to be closed. `callback` will be called
                asynchronously after this call. This MUST be called on each
                handle before memory is released.

                Handles that wrap file descriptors are closed immediately but
                `callback` will still be deferred to the next iteration of the
                event loop. It gives you a chance to free up any resources
                associated with the handle.

                In-progress requests, like `uv_connect_t` or `uv_write_t`, are
                cancelled and have their callbacks called asynchronously with
                `ECANCELED`.

                Returns: Nothing.

uv.ref({handle})                                                      *uv.ref()*

                > method form `handle:ref()`

                Parameters:
                - `handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_handle_t|

                Reference the given handle. References are idempotent, that
                is, if a handle is already referenced calling this function
                again will have no effect.

                Returns: Nothing.

                See |luv-reference-counting|.

uv.unref({handle})                                                  *uv.unref()*

                > method form `handle:unref()`

                Parameters:
                - `handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_handle_t|

                Un-reference the given handle. References are idempotent, that
                is, if a handle is not referenced calling this function again
                will have no effect.

                Returns: Nothing.

See |luv-reference-counting|.

uv.has_ref({handle})                                              *uv.has_ref()*

                > method form `handle:has_ref()`

                Parameters:
                - `handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_handle_t|

                Returns `true` if the handle referenced, `false` if not.

                Returns: `boolean` or `fail`

                See |luv-reference-counting|.

uv.send_buffer_size({handle} [, {size}])                 *uv.send_buffer_size()*

                > method form `handle:send_buffer_size([size])`

                Parameters:
                - `handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_handle_t|
                - `size`: `integer` or `nil` (default: `0`)

                Gets or sets the size of the send buffer that the operating
                system uses for the socket.

                If `size` is omitted (or `0`), this will return the current
                send buffer size; otherwise, this will use `size` to set the
                new send buffer size.

                This function works for TCP, pipe and UDP handles on Unix and
                for TCP and UDP handles on Windows.

                Returns:
                - `integer` or `fail` (if `size` is `nil` or `0`)
                - `0` or `fail` (if `size` is not `nil` and not `0`)

                Note: Linux will set double the size and return double the
                size of the original set value.

uv.recv_buffer_size({handle} [, {size}])                 *uv.recv_buffer_size()*

                > method form `handle:recv_buffer_size([size])`

                Parameters:
                - `handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_handle_t|
                - `size`: `integer` or `nil` (default: `0`)

                Gets or sets the size of the receive buffer that the operating
                system uses for the socket.

                If `size` is omitted (or `0`), this will return the current
                send buffer size; otherwise, this will use `size` to set the
                new send buffer size.

                This function works for TCP, pipe and UDP handles on Unix and
                for TCP and UDP handles on Windows.

                Returns:
                - `integer` or `fail` (if `size` is `nil` or `0`)
                - `0` or `fail` (if `size` is not `nil` and not `0`)

                Note: Linux will set double the size and return double the
                size of the original set value.

uv.fileno({handle})                                                *uv.fileno()*

                > method form `handle:fileno()`

                Parameters:
                - `handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_handle_t|

                Gets the platform dependent file descriptor equivalent.

                The following handles are supported: TCP, pipes, TTY, UDP and
                poll. Passing any other handle type will fail with `EINVAL`.

                If a handle doesn't have an attached file descriptor yet or
                the handle itself has been closed, this function will return
                `EBADF`.

                Returns: `integer` or `fail`

                WARNING: Be very careful when using this function. libuv
                assumes it's in control of the file descriptor so any change
                to it may lead to malfunction.

uv.handle_get_type({handle})                              *uv.handle_get_type()*

                > method form `handle:get_type()`

                Parameters:
                - `handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_handle_t|

                Returns the name of the struct for a given handle (e.g.
                `"pipe"` for |uv_pipe_t|) and the libuv enum integer for the
                handle's type (`uv_handle_type`).

                Returns: `string, integer`

==============================================================================
REFERENCE COUNTING                                      *luv-reference-counting*

The libuv event loop (if run in the default mode) will run until there are no
active and referenced handles left. The user can force the loop to exit early
by unreferencing handles which are active, for example by calling |uv.unref()|
after calling |uv.timer_start()|.

A handle can be referenced or unreferenced, the refcounting scheme doesn't use
a counter, so both operations are idempotent.

All handles are referenced when active by default, see |uv.is_active()| for a
more detailed explanation on what being active involves.

uv.timer_start({timer}, {timeout}, {repeat}, {callback})      *uv.timer_start()*

                > method form `timer:start(timeout, repeat, callback)`

                Parameters:
                - `timer`: `uv_timer_t userdata`
                - `timeout`: `integer`
                - `repeat`: `integer`
                - `callback`: `callable`

                Start the timer. `timeout` and `repeat` are in milliseconds.

                If `timeout` is zero, the callback fires on the next event
                loop iteration. If `repeat` is non-zero, the callback fires
                first after `timeout` milliseconds and then repeatedly after
                `repeat` milliseconds.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

                Stop the timer, the callback will not be called anymore.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.timer_again({timer})                                       *uv.timer_again()*

                Parameters:
                - `timer`: `uv_timer_t userdata`

                Stop the timer, and if it is repeating restart it using the
                repeat value as the timeout. If the timer has never been
                started before it raises `EINVAL`.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

                Parameters:
                - `timer`: `uv_timer_t userdata`
                - `repeat`: `integer`

                Set the repeat interval value in milliseconds. The timer will
                be scheduled to run on the given interval, regardless of the
                callback execution duration, and will follow normal timer
                semantics in the case of a time-slice overrun.

                For example, if a 50 ms repeating timer first runs for 17 ms,
                it will be scheduled to run again 33 ms later. If other tasks
                consume more than the 33 ms following the first timer
                callback, then the callback will run as soon as possible.

uv.new_check()                                                  *uv.new_check()*

                Creates and initializes a new |uv_check_t|. Returns the Lua

> |uv_handle_t| functions also apply.

Idle handles will run the given callback once per loop iteration, right before
the |uv_prepare_t| handles.

Note: The notable difference with prepare handles is that when there are
active idle handles, the loop will perform a zero timeout poll instead of
blocking for I/O.

WARNING: Despite the name, idle handles will get their callbacks called on
every loop iteration, not when the loop is actually "idle".

    >lua
    local idle = uv.new_idle()
    idle:start(function()
      print("Before I/O polling, no blocking")
    end)

                Creates and initializes a new |uv_idle_t|. Returns the Lua
                userdata wrapping it.

                Returns: `uv_idle_t userdata`

uv.idle_start({idle}, {callback})                              *uv.idle_start()*

                - `idle`: `uv_idle_t userdata`
                - `callback`: `callable`

                Start the handle with the given callback.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.idle_stop({check})                                           *uv.idle_stop()*

                Parameters:
                - `idle`: `uv_idle_t userdata`

                Stop the handle, the callback will no longer be called.

`uv_async_t` — Async handle                          *luv-async-handle* *uv_async_t*

> |uv_handle_t| functions also apply.

Async handles allow the user to "wakeup" the event loop and get a callback
called from another thread.

    >lua
    local async
    async = uv.new_async(function()
      print("async operation ran")
      async:close()
    end)

    async:send()
<

uv.new_async({callback})                                        *uv.new_async()*

                Parameters:
                - `callback`: `callable`
                  - `...`: `threadargs` passed to/from
                    `uv.async_send(async, ...)`

                Creates and initializes a new |uv_async_t|. Returns the Lua
                userdata wrapping it.

                Returns: `uv_async_t userdata` or `fail`

                Note: Unlike other handle initialization functions, this
                immediately starts the handle.

uv.async_send({async}, {...})                                  *uv.async_send()*

                > method form `async:send(...)`

                Parameters:
                - `async`: `uv_async_t userdata`
                - `...`: `threadargs`

                Wakeup the event loop and call the async handle's callback.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

                Note: It's safe to call this function from any thread. The
                callback will be called on the loop thread.

                WARNING: libuv will coalesce calls to `uv.async_send(async)`,
                that is, not every call to it will yield an execution of the
                callback. For example: if `uv.async_send()` is called 5 times
                in a row before the callback is called, the callback will only
                be called once. If `uv.async_send()` is called again after the
                callback was called, it will be called again.

`uv_poll_t` — Poll handle                              *luv-poll-handle* *uv_poll_t*

> |uv_handle_t| functions also apply.

Poll handles are used to watch file descriptors for readability and
writability, similar to the purpose of poll(2)
(https://linux.die.net/man/2/poll).

The purpose of poll handles is to enable integrating external libraries that
rely on the event loop to signal it about the socket status changes, like
c-ares or libssh2. Using `uv_poll_t` for any other purpose is not recommended;
|uv_tcp_t|, |uv_udp_t|, etc. provide an implementation that is faster and more
scalable than what can be achieved with `uv_poll_t`, especially on Windows.

It is possible that poll handles occasionally signal that a file descriptor is
readable or writable even when it isn't. The user should therefore always be
prepared to handle EAGAIN or equivalent when it attempts to read from or write
to the fd.

It is not okay to have multiple active poll handles for the same socket, this
can cause libuv to busyloop or otherwise malfunction.

The user should not close a file descriptor while it is being polled by an
active poll handle. This can cause the handle to report an error, but it might
also start polling another socket. However the fd can be safely closed
immediately after a call to |uv.poll_stop()| or |uv.close()|.

Note: On windows only sockets can be polled with poll handles. On Unix any
file descriptor that would be accepted by poll(2) can be used.

uv.new_poll({fd})                                                *uv.new_poll()*

                Parameters:
                - `fd`: `integer`

                Initialize the handle using a file descriptor.

                The file descriptor is set to non-blocking mode.

                Returns: `uv_poll_t userdata` or `fail`

uv.new_socket_poll({fd})                                  *uv.new_socket_poll()*

                Parameters:
                - `fd`: `integer`

                Initialize the handle using a socket descriptor. On Unix this
                is identical to |uv.new_poll()|. On windows it takes a SOCKET
                handle.

                The socket is set to non-blocking mode.

                Returns: `uv_poll_t userdata` or `fail`

uv.poll_start({poll}, {events}, {callback})                    *uv.poll_start()*

                > method form `poll:start(events, callback)`

                Parameters:
                - `poll`: `uv_poll_t userdata`
                - `events`: `string` or `nil` (default: `"rw"`)
                - `callback`: `callable`
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`
                  - `events`: `string` or `nil`

                Starts polling the file descriptor. `events` are: `"r"`,
                `"w"`, `"rw"`, `"d"`, `"rd"`, `"wd"`, `"rwd"`, `"p"`, `"rp"`,
                `"wp"`, `"rwp"`, `"dp"`, `"rdp"`, `"wdp"`, or `"rwdp"` where
                `r` is `READABLE`, `w` is `WRITABLE`, `d` is `DISCONNECT`, and
                `p` is `PRIORITIZED`. As soon as an event is detected the
                callback will be called with status set to 0, and the detected
                events set on the events field.

                The user should not close the socket while the handle is
                active. If the user does that anyway, the callback may be
                called reporting an error status, but this is not guaranteed.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

                Note Calling `uv.poll_start()` on a handle that is already
                active is fine. Doing so will update the events mask that is
                being watched for.

uv.poll_stop({poll})                                            *uv.poll_stop()*

                > method form `poll:stop()`

                Parameters:
                - `poll`: `uv_poll_t userdata`

                Stop polling the file descriptor, the callback will no longer
                be called.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

`uv_signal_t` — Signal handle                      *luv-signal-handle* *uv_signal_t*

> |uv_handle_t| functions also apply.

Signal handles implement Unix style signal handling on a per-event loop bases.

Windows Notes:

Reception of some signals is emulated on Windows:
  - SIGINT is normally delivered when the user presses CTRL+C. However, like
    on Unix, it is not generated when terminal raw mode is enabled.
  - SIGBREAK is delivered when the user pressed CTRL + BREAK.
  - SIGHUP is generated when the user closes the console window. On SIGHUP the
    program is given approximately 10 seconds to perform cleanup. After that
    Windows will unconditionally terminate it.
  - SIGWINCH is raised whenever libuv detects that the console has been
    resized. SIGWINCH is emulated by libuv when the program uses a uv_tty_t
    handle to write to the console. SIGWINCH may not always be delivered in a
    timely manner; libuv will only detect size changes when the cursor is
    being moved. When a readable |uv_tty_t| handle is used in raw mode,
    resizing the console buffer will also trigger a SIGWINCH signal.
  - Watchers for other signals can be successfully created, but these signals
    are never received. These signals are: SIGILL, SIGABRT, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV,
    SIGTERM and SIGKILL.
  - Calls to raise() or abort() to programmatically raise a signal are not
    detected by libuv; these will not trigger a signal watcher.

Unix Notes:

  - SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are impossible to catch.
  - Handling SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL or SIGSEGV via libuv results into
    undefined behavior.
  - SIGABRT will not be caught by libuv if generated by abort(), e.g. through
    assert().
  - On Linux SIGRT0 and SIGRT1 (signals 32 and 33) are used by the NPTL
    pthreads library to manage threads. Installing watchers for those signals
    will lead to unpredictable behavior and is strongly discouraged. Future
    versions of libuv may simply reject them.

`uv_process_t` — Process handle                  *luv-process-handle* *uv_process_t*

> |uv_handle_t| functions also apply.

Process handles will spawn a new process and allow the user to control it and
establish communication channels with it using streams.

uv.disable_stdio_inheritance()                  *uv.disable_stdio_inheritance()*

                Disables inheritance for file descriptors / handles that this
                process inherited from its parent. The effect is that child
                processes spawned by this process don't accidentally inherit
                these handles.

                It is recommended to call this function as early in your
                program as possible, before the inherited file descriptors can
                be closed or duplicated.

                Returns: Nothing.

                Note: This function works on a best-effort basis: there is no
                guarantee that libuv can discover all file descriptors that
                were inherited. In general it does a better job on Windows
                than it does on Unix.

uv.spawn({path}, {options}, {on_exit})                              *uv.spawn()*

                Parameters:
                - `path`: `string`
                - `options`: `table` (see below)
                - `on_exit`: `callable`
                  - `code`: `integer`
                  - `signal`: `integer`

                Initializes the process handle and starts the process. If the
                process is successfully spawned, this function will return the
                handle and pid of the child process.

                Possible reasons for failing to spawn would include (but not
                be limited to) the file to execute not existing, not having
                permissions to use the setuid or setgid specified, or not
                having enough memory to allocate for the new process.

                    program, since that is already provided via `path`. On
                    Windows, this uses CreateProcess which concatenates the
                    arguments into a string. This can cause some strange
                    errors (see `options.verbatim` below for Windows).
                  - `options.stdio` - Set the file descriptors that will be
                    made available to the child process. The convention is
                    that the first entries are stdin, stdout, and stderr.
                    (Note: On Windows, file descriptors after the third are
                    available to the child process only if the child processes
                    uses the MSVCRT runtime.)
                  - `options.env` - Set environment variables for the new
                    process.
                  - `options.cwd` - Set the current working directory for the
                    sub-process.
                  - `options.uid` - Set the child process' user id.
                  - `options.gid` - Set the child process' group id.
                  - `options.verbatim` - If true, do not wrap any arguments in
                    quotes, or perform any other escaping, when converting the
                    argument list into a command line string. This option is
                    only meaningful on Windows systems. On Unix it is silently
                    ignored.
                  - `options.detached` - If true, spawn the child process in a
                    detached state - this will make it a process group leader,
                    and will effectively enable the child to keep running
                    after the parent exits. Note that the child process will
                    still keep the parent's event loop alive unless the parent
                    process calls |uv.unref()| on the child's process handle.
                  - `options.hide` - If true, hide the subprocess console
                    window that would normally be created. This option is only
                    meaningful on Windows systems. On Unix it is silently
                    ignored.

                The `options.stdio` entries can take many shapes.

                  - If they are numbers, then the child process inherits that
                    same zero-indexed fd from the parent process.
                  - If |uv_stream_t| handles are passed in, those are used as
                    a read-write pipe or inherited stream depending if the
                    stream has a valid fd.
                  - Including `nil` placeholders means to ignore that fd in
                    the child process.

                When the child process exits, `on_exit` is called with an exit
                code and signal.

                Returns: `uv_process_t userdata`, `integer`

uv.process_kill({process}, {signame})                         *uv.process_kill()*

                > method form `process:kill(signame)`

                Parameters:
                - `process`: `uv_process_t userdata`

                Returns the handle's pid.

`uv_stream_t` — Stream handle                      *luv-stream-handle* *uv_stream_t*

> |uv_handle_t| functions also apply.

Stream handles provide an abstraction of a duplex communication channel.
`uv_stream_t` is an abstract type, libuv provides 3 stream implementations
in the form of |uv_tcp_t|, |uv_pipe_t| and |uv_tty_t|.

uv.shutdown({stream} [, {callback}])                             *uv.shutdown()*

                > method form `stream:shutdown([callback])`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|
                - `callback`: `callable` or `nil`
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`

                Shutdown the outgoing (write) side of a duplex stream. It
                waits for pending write requests to complete. The callback is
                called after shutdown is complete.

                Returns: `uv_shutdown_t userdata` or `fail`

uv.listen({stream}, {backlog}, {callback})                         *uv.listen()*

                > method form `stream:listen(backlog, callback)`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|
                - `backlog`: `integer`
                - `callback`: `callable`
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`

                Start listening for incoming connections. `backlog` indicates
                the number of connections the kernel might queue, same as
                `listen(2)`. When a new incoming connection is received the
                callback is called.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.accept({stream}, {client_stream})                               *uv.accept()*

                > method form `stream:accept(client_stream)`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|
                - `client_stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|

                This call is used in conjunction with |uv.listen()| to accept
                incoming connections. Call this function after receiving a
                callback to accept the connection.

                When the connection callback is called it is guaranteed that
                this function will complete successfully the first time. If
                you attempt to use it more than once, it may fail. It is
                suggested to only call this function once per connection call.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

                    >lua
                    server:listen(128, function (err)

uv.read_start({stream}, {callback})                            *uv.read_start()*

                > method form `stream:read_start(callback)`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|
                - `callback`: `callable`
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`
                  - `data`: `string` or `nil`

                Read data from an incoming stream. The callback will be made
                several times until there is no more data to read or
                |uv.read_stop()| is called. When we've reached EOF, `data`
                will be `nil`.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

                    >lua
                    stream:read_start(function (err, chunk)

uv.read_stop({stream})                                          *uv.read_stop()*

                > method form `stream:read_stop()`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|

                Stop reading data from the stream. The read callback will no
                longer be called.

                This function is idempotent and may be safely called on a
                stopped stream.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.write({stream}, {data} [, {callback}])                           *uv.write()*

                > method form `stream:write(data, [callback])`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|
                - `data`: `buffer`
                - `callback`: `callable` or `nil`
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`

                Write data to stream.

                `data` can either be a Lua string or a table of strings. If a
                table is passed in, the C backend will use writev to send all
                strings in a single system call.

                The optional `callback` is for knowing when the write is
                complete.

                Returns: `uv_write_t userdata` or `fail`

uv.write2({stream}, {data}, {send_handle} [, {callback}])          *uv.write2()*

                > method form `stream:write2(data, send_handle, [callback])`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|
                - `data`: `buffer`
                - `send_handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|
                - `callback`: `callable` or `nil`
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`

                Extended write function for sending handles over a pipe. The
                pipe must be initialized with `ipc` option `true`.

                Returns: `uv_write_t userdata` or `fail`

                Note: `send_handle` must be a TCP socket or pipe, which is a
                server or a connection (listening or connected state). Bound
                sockets or pipes will be assumed to be servers.

uv.try_write({stream}, {data})                                  *uv.try_write()*

                > method form `stream:try_write(data)`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|
                - `data`: `buffer`

                Same as |uv.write()|, but won't queue a write request if it
                can't be completed immediately.

                Will return number of bytes written (can be less than the
                supplied buffer size).

                Returns: `integer` or `fail`

uv.try_write2({stream}, {data}, {send_handle})                 *uv.try_write2()*

                > method form `stream:try_write2(data, send_handle)`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|
                - `data`: `buffer`
                - `send_handle`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|

                Like |uv.write2()|, but with the properties of
                |uv.try_write()|. Not supported on Windows, where it returns
                `UV_EAGAIN`.

                Will return number of bytes written (can be less than the
                supplied buffer size).

                Returns: `integer` or `fail`

uv.is_readable({stream})                                      *uv.is_readable()*

                > method form `stream:is_readable()`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|

                Returns `true` if the stream is readable, `false` otherwise.

                Returns: `boolean`

uv.is_writable({stream})                                      *uv.is_writable()*

                > method form `stream:is_writable()`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|

                Returns `true` if the stream is writable, `false` otherwise.

                Returns: `boolean`

uv.stream_set_blocking({stream}, {blocking})          *uv.stream_set_blocking()*

                > method form `stream:set_blocking(blocking)`

                Parameters:
                - `stream`: `userdata` for sub-type of |uv_stream_t|
                - `blocking`: `boolean`

                Enable or disable blocking mode for a stream.

                When blocking mode is enabled all writes complete
                synchronously. The interface remains unchanged otherwise, e.g.
                completion or failure of the operation will still be reported
                through a callback which is made asynchronously.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

                WARNING: Relying too much on this API is not recommended. It
                is likely to change significantly in the future. Currently
                this only works on Windows and only for |uv_pipe_t| handles.
                Also libuv currently makes no ordering guarantee when the
                blocking mode is changed after write requests have already
                been submitted. Therefore it is recommended to set the
                blocking mode immediately after opening or creating the
                stream.

uv.stream_get_write_queue_size()              *uv.stream_get_write_queue_size()*

                > method form `stream:get_write_queue_size()`

                Returns the stream's write queue size.

                Returns: `integer`

                - `flags`: `string` or `integer` or `nil`

                Creates and initializes a new |uv_tcp_t|. Returns the Lua
                userdata wrapping it.

                If set, `flags` must be a valid address family. See
                |luv-constants| for supported address family input values.

                Returns: `uv_tcp_t userdata` or `fail`

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

                Note: The passed file descriptor or SOCKET is not checked for
                its type, but it's required that it represents a valid stream
                socket.

                in seconds, ignored when enable is `false`.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.tcp_simultaneous_accepts({tcp}, {enable})     *uv.tcp_simultaneous_accepts()*

                > method form `tcp:simultaneous_accepts(enable)`

                Parameters:
                - `tcp`: `uv_tcp_t userdata`
                - `enable`: `boolean`

                Enable / disable simultaneous asynchronous accept requests
                that are queued by the operating system when listening for new
                TCP connections.

                This setting is used to tune a TCP server for the desired
                performance. Having simultaneous accepts can significantly
                improve the rate of accepting connections (which is why it is
                enabled by default) but may lead to uneven load distribution
                in multi-process setups.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.tcp_bind({tcp}, {host}, {port} [, {flags}])                   *uv.tcp_bind()*

                > method form `tcp:bind(host, port, [flags])`

                Parameters:
                - `tcp`: `uv_tcp_t userdata`
                - `host`: `string`
                - `port`: `integer`
                - `flags`: `table` or `nil`
                  - `ipv6only`: `boolean`

                Bind the handle to an host and port. `host` should be an IP
                address and not a domain name. Any `flags` are set with a
                table with field `ipv6only` equal to `true` or `false`.

                When the port is already taken, you can expect to see an
                `EADDRINUSE` error from either `uv.tcp_bind()`, |uv.listen()|
                or |uv.tcp_connect()|. That is, a successful call to this
                function does not guarantee that the call to |uv.listen()| or
                |uv.tcp_connect()| will succeed as well.

                Use a port of `0` to let the OS assign an ephemeral port.  You
                can look it up later using |uv.tcp_getsockname()|.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.tcp_getpeername({tcp})                                 *uv.tcp_getpeername()*

                Parameters:
                - `tcp`: `uv_tcp_t userdata`

                Get the current address to which the handle is bound.

                See |luv-constants| for supported address `family` output values.

                Returns: `table` or `fail`
                - `ip` : `string`
                - `family` : `string`
                - `port` : `integer`

uv.tcp_connect({tcp}, {host}, {port}, {callback})             *uv.tcp_connect()*

                > method form `tcp:connect(host, port, callback)`

                Parameters:
                - `tcp`: `uv_tcp_t userdata`
                - `host`: `string`
                - `port`: `integer`
                - `callback`: `callable`
                   - `err`: `nil` or `string`

                Establish an IPv4 or IPv6 TCP connection.

                Returns: `uv_connect_t userdata` or `fail`

                DEPRECATED: Please use |uv.stream_get_write_queue_size()|
                instead.

uv.tcp_close_reset([{callback}])                          *uv.tcp_close_reset()*

                > method form `tcp:close_reset([callback])`

                Parameters:
                - `tcp`: `uv_tcp_t userdata`
                - `callback`: `callable` or `nil`

                Resets a TCP connection by sending a RST packet. This is
                accomplished by setting the SO_LINGER socket option with a
                linger interval of zero and then calling |uv.close()|. Due to
                some platform inconsistencies, mixing of |uv.shutdown()| and
                `uv.tcp_close_reset()` calls is not allowed.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`
                                                               *uv.socketpair()*
uv.socketpair([{socktype}, [{protocol}, [{flags1}, [{flags2}]]]])

                Parameters:
                - `socktype`: `string`, `integer` or `nil` (default: `stream`)
                - `protocol`: `string`, `integer` or `nil` (default: 0)
                - `flags1`: `table` or `nil`
                  - `nonblock`: `boolean` (default: `false`)
                - `flags2`: `table` or `nil`
                  - `nonblock`: `boolean` (default: `false`)

                Create a pair of connected sockets with the specified
                properties. The resulting handles can be passed to
                |uv.tcp_open()|, used with |uv.spawn()|, or for any other
                purpose.

                See |luv-constants| for supported `socktype` input values.

                When `protocol` is set to 0 or nil, it will be automatically
                chosen based on the socket's domain and type. When `protocol`
                is specified as a string, it will be looked up using the
                `getprotobyname(3)` function (examples: `"ip"`, `"icmp"`,
                `"tcp"`, `"udp"`, etc).

                Flags:
                 - `nonblock`: Opens the specified socket handle for
                   `OVERLAPPED` or `FIONBIO`/`O_NONBLOCK` I/O usage. This is
                   recommended for handles that will be used by libuv, and not
                   usually recommended otherwise.

                Equivalent to `socketpair(2)` with a domain of `AF_UNIX`.

                Returns: `table` or `fail`
                - `[1, 2]` : `integer` (file descriptor)

                - If `type(flags)` is `number`, it must be `0` or
                  `uv.constants.PIPE_NO_TRUNCATE`.
                - If `type(flags)` is `table`, it must be `{}` or
                  `{ no_truncate = true|false }`.
                - If `type(flags)` is `nil`, it use default value `0`.
                - Returns `EINVAL` for unsupported flags without performing the
                  bind operation.

                Connect to the Unix domain socket or the named pipe.

                Supports Linux abstract namespace sockets. namelen must include
                the leading nul byte but not the trailing nul byte.

                Returns: `uv_connect_t userdata` or `fail`

`uv_tty_t` — TTY handle                                  *luv-tty-handle* *uv_tty_t*

> |uv_handle_t| and |uv_stream_t| functions also apply.

TTY handles represent a stream for the console.

    >lua
    -- Simple echo program
    local stdin = uv.new_tty(0, true)
    local stdout = uv.new_tty(1, false)

    stdin:read_start(function (err, data)
      assert(not err, err)
      if data then
        stdout:write(data)
      else
        stdin:close()
        stdout:close()
      end
    end)
<

uv.new_tty({fd}, {readable})                                      *uv.new_tty()*

                Parameters:
                - `fd`: `integer`
                - `readable`: `boolean`

                Initialize a new TTY stream with the given file descriptor.
                Usually the file descriptor will be:

                 - 0 - stdin
                 - 1 - stdout
                 - 2 - stderr

                On Unix this function will determine the path of the fd of the
                terminal using ttyname_r(3), open it, and use it if the passed
                file descriptor refers to a TTY. This lets libuv put the tty
                in non-blocking mode without affecting other processes that
                share the tty.

                This function is not thread safe on systems that don’t support
                ioctl TIOCGPTN or TIOCPTYGNAME, for instance OpenBSD and
                Solaris.

                Returns: `uv_tty_t userdata` or `fail`

                Note: If reopening the TTY fails, libuv falls back to blocking
                writes.

uv.tty_set_mode({tty}, {mode})                               *uv.tty_set_mode()*

                > method form `tty:set_mode(mode)`

                Parameters:
                - `tty`: `uv_tty_t userdata`
                - `mode`: `string` or `integer`

                Set the TTY using the specified terminal mode.

                See |luv-constants| for supported TTY mode input values.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.tty_reset_mode()                                        *uv.tty_reset_mode()*

                To be called when the program exits. Resets TTY settings to
                default values for the next process to take over.

                This function is async signal-safe on Unix platforms but can
                fail with error code `EBUSY` if you call it when execution is
                inside |uv.tty_set_mode()|.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.tty_get_winsize({tty})                                 *uv.tty_get_winsize()*

                > method form `tty:get_winsize()`

                Parameters:
                - `tty`: `uv_tty_t userdata`

                Gets the current Window width and height.

                Returns: `integer, integer` or `fail`

uv.tty_set_vterm_state({state})                       *uv.tty_set_vterm_state()*

                Parameters:
                - `state`: `string`

                Controls whether console virtual terminal sequences are
                processed by libuv or console. Useful in particular for
                enabling ConEmu support of ANSI X3.64 and Xterm 256 colors.
                Otherwise Windows10 consoles are usually detected
                automatically. State should be one of: `"supported"` or
                `"unsupported"`.

                This function is only meaningful on Windows systems. On Unix
                it is silently ignored.

                Returns: none

uv.tty_get_vterm_state()                              *uv.tty_get_vterm_state()*

                Get the current state of whether console virtual terminal
                sequences are handled by libuv or the console. The return
                value is `"supported"` or `"unsupported"`.

                This function is not implemented on Unix, where it returns
                `ENOTSUP`.

                Returns: `string` or `fail`

`uv_udp_t` — UDP handle                                  *luv-udp-handle* *uv_udp_t*

> |uv_handle_t| functions also apply.

UDP handles encapsulate UDP communication for both clients and servers.

uv.new_udp([{flags}])                                             *uv.new_udp()*

                Parameters:
                - `flags`: `table` or `nil`
                  - `family`: `string` or `nil`
                  - `mmsgs`: `integer` or `nil` (default: `1`)

                Creates and initializes a new |uv_udp_t|. Returns the Lua
                userdata wrapping it. The actual socket is created lazily.

                See |luv-constants| for supported address `family` input values.

                When specified, `mmsgs` determines the number of messages able
                to be received at one time via `recvmmsg(2)` (the allocated
                buffer will be sized to be able to fit the specified number of
                max size dgrams). Only has an effect on platforms that support
                `recvmmsg(2)`.

                Note: For backwards compatibility reasons, `flags` can also be
                a string or integer. When it is a string, it will be treated
                like the `family` key above. When it is an integer, it will be
                used directly as the `flags` parameter when calling
                `uv_udp_init_ex`.

                Returns: `uv_udp_t userdata` or `fail`

uv.udp_get_send_queue_size()                      *uv.udp_get_send_queue_size()*

                > method form `udp:get_send_queue_size()`

                Returns the handle's send queue size.

                Returns: `integer`

uv.udp_get_send_queue_count()                    *uv.udp_get_send_queue_count()*

                > method form `udp:get_send_queue_count()`

                Returns the handle's send queue count.

                Returns: `integer`

uv.udp_open({udp}, {fd})                                         *uv.udp_open()*

                > method form `udp:open(fd)`

                Parameters:
                - `udp`: `uv_udp_t userdata`
                - `fd`: `integer`

                Opens an existing file descriptor or Windows SOCKET as a UDP
                handle.

                Unix only: The only requirement of the sock argument is that
                it follows the datagram contract (works in unconnected mode,
                supports sendmsg()/recvmsg(), etc). In other words, other
                datagram-type sockets like raw sockets or netlink sockets can
                also be passed to this function.

                The file descriptor is set to non-blocking mode.

                Note: The passed file descriptor or SOCKET is not checked for
                its type, but it's required that it represents a valid
                datagram socket.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.udp_bind({udp}, {host}, {port} [, {flags}])                   *uv.udp_bind()*

                > method form `udp:bind(host, port, [flags])`

                Bind the UDP handle to an IP address and port. Any `flags` are
                set with a table with fields `reuseaddr` or `ipv6only` equal
                to `true` or `false`.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

                Send data over the UDP socket. If the socket has not
                previously been bound with |uv.udp_bind()| it will be bound to
                `0.0.0.0` (the "all interfaces" IPv4 address) and a random
                port number.

                Returns: `uv_udp_send_t userdata` or `fail`

                Parameters:
                - `udp`: `uv_udp_t userdata`
                - `messages`: `table`
                  - `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` : `table`
                    - `data` : `buffer`
                    - `addr` : `table`
                      - `ip` : `string`
                      - `port` : `integer`
                - `flags`: `nil` (see below)
                - `port`: `integer`

                Like `uv.udp_try_send()`, but can send multiple datagrams.
                Lightweight abstraction around `sendmmsg(2)`, with a
                `sendmsg(2)` fallback loop for platforms that do not support
                the former. The `udp` handle must be fully initialized, either
                from a `uv.udp_bind` call, another call that will bind
                automatically (`udp_send`, `udp_try_send`, etc), or from
                `uv.udp_connect`. `messages` should be an array-like table,
                where `addr` must be specified if the `udp` has not been
                connected via `udp_connect`. Otherwise, `addr` must be `nil`.

                `flags` is reserved for future extension and must currently be
                `nil` or `0` or `{}`.

                Returns the number of messages sent successfully. An error will only be returned
                if the first datagram failed to be sent.

                Returns: `integer` or `fail`

uv.udp_recv_start({udp}, {callback})                       *uv.udp_recv_start()*

                > method form `udp:recv_start(callback)`

                Parameters:
                - `udp`: `uv_udp_t userdata`
                - `callback`: `callable`
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`
                  - `data`: `string` or `nil`
                  - `addr`: `table` or `nil`
                    - `ip`: `string`
                    - `port`: `integer`
                    - `family`: `string`
                  - `flags`: `table`
                    - `partial`: `boolean` or `nil`
                    - `mmsg_chunk`: `boolean` or `nil`

                Prepare for receiving data. If the socket has not previously
                been bound with |uv.udp_bind()| it is bound to `0.0.0.0` (the
                "all interfaces" IPv4 address) and a random port number.

                See |luv-constants| for supported address `family` output values.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.udp_recv_stop({udp})                                     *uv.udp_recv_stop()*

                > method form `udp:recv_stop()`

                Parameters:
                - `udp`: `uv_udp_t userdata`

                Stop listening for incoming datagrams.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.udp_connect({udp}, {host}, {port})                         *uv.udp_connect()*

                > method form `udp:connect(host, port)`

                Parameters:
                - `udp`: `uv_udp_t userdata`
                - `host`: `string`
                - `port`: `integer`

                Associate the UDP handle to a remote address and port, so
                every message sent by this handle is automatically sent to
                that destination. Calling this function with a NULL addr
                disconnects the handle. Trying to call `uv.udp_connect()` on
                an already connected handle will result in an `EISCONN` error.
                Trying to disconnect a handle that is not connected will
                return an `ENOTCONN` error.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

`uv_fs_event_t` — FS Event handle              *luv-fs-event-handle* *uv_fs_event_t*

> |uv_handle_t| functions also apply.

FS Event handles allow the user to monitor a given path for changes, for
example, if the file was renamed or there was a generic change in it. This
handle uses the best backend for the job on each platform.

uv.new_fs_event()                                            *uv.new_fs_event()*

                Creates and initializes a new |uv_fs_event_t|. Returns the Lua
                userdata wrapping it.

                Returns: `uv_fs_event_t userdata` or `fail`

uv.fs_event_start({fs_event}, {path}, {flags}, {callback}) *uv.fs_event_start()*

                > method form `fs_event:start(path, flags, callback)`

                Parameters:
                - `fs_event`: `uv_fs_event_t userdata`
                - `path`: `string`
                - `flags`: `table`
                  - `watch_entry`: `boolean` or `nil` (default: `false`)
                  - `stat`: `boolean` or `nil` (default: `false`)
                  - `recursive`: `boolean` or `nil` (default: `false`)
                - `callback`: `callable`
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`
                  - `filename`: `string`
                  - `events`: `table`
                    - `change`: `boolean` or `nil`
                    - `rename`: `boolean` or `nil`

                Start the handle with the given callback, which will watch the
                specified path for changes.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.fs_event_stop()                                          *uv.fs_event_stop()*

                > method form `fs_event:stop()`

                Stop the handle, the callback will no longer be called.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.fs_event_getpath()                                    *uv.fs_event_getpath()*

                > method form `fs_event:getpath()`

                Get the path being monitored by the handle.

                Returns: `string` or `fail`

==============================================================================
`uv_fs_poll_t` — FS Poll handle                  *luv-fs-poll-handle* *uv_fs_poll_t*

> |uv_handle_t| functions also apply.

FS Poll handles allow the user to monitor a given path for changes. Unlike
|uv_fs_event_t|, fs poll handles use `stat` to detect when a file has changed
so they can work on file systems where fs event handles can't.

uv.new_fs_poll()                                              *uv.new_fs_poll()*

                Creates and initializes a new |uv_fs_poll_t|. Returns the Lua
                userdata wrapping it.

                Returns: `uv_fs_poll_t userdata` or `fail`

uv.fs_poll_start({fs_poll}, {path}, {interval}, {callback}) *uv.fs_poll_start()*

                > method form `fs_poll:start(path, interval, callback)`

                Parameters:
                - `fs_poll`: `uv_fs_poll_t userdata`
                - `path`: `string`
                - `interval`: `integer`
                - `callback`: `callable`
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`
                  - `prev`: `table` or `nil` (see `uv.fs_stat`)
                  - `curr`: `table` or `nil` (see `uv.fs_stat`)

                Check the file at `path` for changes every `interval`
                milliseconds.

                Note: For maximum portability, use multi-second intervals.
                Sub-second intervals will not detect all changes on many file
                systems.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.fs_poll_stop()                                            *uv.fs_poll_stop()*

                > method form `fs_poll:stop()`

                Stop the handle, the callback will no longer be called.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.fs_poll_getpath()                                      *uv.fs_poll_getpath()*

                > method form `fs_poll:getpath()`

                Get the path being monitored by the handle.

                Returns: `string` or `fail`

==============================================================================
FILE SYSTEM OPERATIONS                      *luv-file-system-operations* *uv_fs_t*

Most file system functions can operate synchronously or asynchronously. When a
synchronous version is called (by omitting a callback), the function will
immediately return the results of the FS call. When an asynchronous version is
called (by providing a callback), the function will immediately return a
`uv_fs_t userdata` and asynchronously execute its callback; if an error is
encountered, the first and only argument passed to the callback will be the
`err` error string; if the operation completes successfully, the first
argument will be `nil` and the remaining arguments will be the results of the
FS call.

Synchronous and asynchronous versions of `readFile` (with naive error
handling) are implemented below as an example:

    >lua
    local function readFileSync(path)
      local fd = assert(uv.fs_open(path, "r", 438))
      local stat = assert(uv.fs_fstat(fd))
      local data = assert(uv.fs_read(fd, stat.size, 0))
      assert(uv.fs_close(fd))
      return data
    end

    local data = readFileSync("main.lua")
    print("synchronous read", data)
<

    >lua
    local function readFile(path, callback)
      uv.fs_open(path, "r", 438, function(err, fd)
        assert(not err, err)
        uv.fs_fstat(fd, function(err, stat)
          assert(not err, err)
          uv.fs_read(fd, stat.size, 0, function(err, data)
            assert(not err, err)
            uv.fs_close(fd, function(err)
              assert(not err, err)
              return callback(data)
            end)
          end)
        end)
      end)
    end

    readFile("main.lua", function(data)
      print("asynchronous read", data)
    end)

uv.fs_close({fd} [, {callback}])                                 *uv.fs_close()*

                Parameters:
                - `fd`: `integer`
                - `callback`: `callable` (async version) or `nil` (sync
                  version)
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`
                  - `success`: `boolean` or `nil`

                Equivalent to `close(2)`.

                Returns (sync version): `boolean` or `fail`

                Returns (async version): `uv_fs_t userdata`

uv.fs_open({path}, {flags}, {mode} [, {callback}])                *uv.fs_open()*

                Parameters:
                - `path`: `string`
                - `flags`: `string` or `integer`
                - `mode`: `integer` (octal `chmod(1)` mode, e.g.
                  `tonumber('644', 8)`)
                - `callback`: `callable` (async version) or `nil` (sync
                  version)
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`
                  - `fd`: `integer` or `nil`

                one of: `"r"`, `"rs"`, `"sr"`, `"r+"`, `"rs+"`, `"sr+"`,
                `"w"`, `"wx"`, `"xw"`, `"w+"`, `"wx+"`, `"xw+"`, `"a"`,
                `"ax"`, `"xa"`, `"a+"`, `"ax+"`, or "`xa+`".

                Returns (sync version): `integer` or `fail`

                Returns (async version): `uv_fs_t userdata`

                Note: On Windows, libuv uses `CreateFileW` and thus the file
                is always opened in binary mode. Because of this, the
                `O_BINARY` and `O_TEXT` flags are not supported.

uv.fs_read({fd}, {size} [, {offset} [, {callback}]])              *uv.fs_read()*

                indicates EOF.

                If `offset` is nil or omitted, it will default to `-1`, which
                indicates "use and update the current file offset."

                Note: When `offset` is >= 0, the current file offset will not
                be updated by the read.

                Returns (sync version): `string` or `fail`

                Returns (async version): `uv_fs_t userdata`

uv.fs_unlink({path} [, {callback}])                             *uv.fs_unlink()*

                Parameters:

                - `fd`: `integer`
                - `data`: `buffer`
                - `offset`: `integer` or `nil`
                - `callback`: `callable` (async version) or `nil` (sync

                written.

                If `offset` is nil or omitted, it will default to `-1`, which
                indicates "use and update the current file offset."

                Note: When `offset` is >= 0, the current file offset will not
                be updated by the write.

                Returns (sync version): `integer` or `fail`

                Returns (async version): `uv_fs_t userdata`

uv.fs_mkdir({path}, {mode} [, {callback}])                       *uv.fs_mkdir()*

                Returns a handle that the user can pass to
                |uv.fs_scandir_next()|.

                Note: This function can be used synchronously or
                asynchronously. The request userdata is always synchronously
                returned regardless of whether a callback is provided and the
                same userdata is passed to the callback if it is provided.

                Returns: `uv_fs_t userdata` or `fail`

                next directory entry data as a `name, type` pair. When there
                are no more entries, `nil` is returned.

                Note: This function only has a synchronous version. See
                |uv.fs_opendir()| and its related functions for an
                asynchronous version.

THREAD POOL WORK SCHEDULING                    *luv-thread-pool-work-scheduling*

Libuv provides a threadpool which can be used to run user code and get
notified in the loop thread. This threadpool is internally used to run all
file system operations, as well as `getaddrinfo` and `getnameinfo` requests.

    >lua
    local function work_callback(a, b)
      return a + b
    end

    local function after_work_callback(c)
      print("The result is: " .. c)
    end

    local work = uv.new_work(work_callback, after_work_callback)

    work:queue(1, 2)

    -- output: "The result is: 3"
<

uv.new_work({work_callback}, {after_work_callback})              *uv.new_work()*

                Parameters:
                - `work_callback`: `function` or `string`
                  - `...`: `threadargs` passed to/from
                    `uv.queue_work(work_ctx, ...)`
                - `after_work_callback`: `function`
                  - `...`: `threadargs` returned from `work_callback`

                Creates and initializes a new `luv_work_ctx_t` (not
                `uv_work_t`).
                `work_callback` is a Lua function or a string containing Lua
                code or bytecode dumped from a function. Returns the Lua
                userdata wrapping it.

                Returns: `luv_work_ctx_t userdata`

uv.queue_work({work_ctx}, {...})                               *uv.queue_work()*

                > method form `work_ctx:queue(...)`

                Parameters:
                - `work_ctx`: `luv_work_ctx_t userdata`
                - `...`: `threadargs`

                Queues a work request which will run `work_callback` in a new
                Lua state in a thread from the threadpool with any additional
                arguments from `...`. Values returned from `work_callback` are
                passed to `after_work_callback`, which is called in the main
                loop thread.

                Returns: `boolean` or `fail`

                See |luv-constants| for supported `socktype` input and
                output values.

                When `protocol` is set to `0` or `nil`, it will be
                automatically chosen based on the socket's domain and type.
                When `protocol` is specified as a string, it will be looked up
                using the `getprotobyname(3)` function. Examples: `"ip"`,
                `"icmp"`, `"tcp"`, `"udp"`, etc.

                Returns (sync version): `table` or `fail`

THREADING AND SYNCHRONIZATION UTILITIES *luv-threading-and-synchronization-utilities*

Libuv provides cross-platform implementations for multiple threading and
synchronization primitives. The API largely follows the pthreads API.

uv.new_thread([{options}, ] {entry}, {...})                    *uv.new_thread()*

                Parameters:
                - `options`: `table` or `nil`
                  - `stack_size`: `integer` or `nil`
                - `entry`: `function` or `string`
                - `...`: `threadargs` passed to `entry`

                Creates and initializes a `luv_thread_t` (not `uv_thread_t`).
                Returns the Lua userdata wrapping it and asynchronously
                executes `entry`, which can be either a Lua function or a
                string containing Lua code or bytecode dumped from a function.
                Additional arguments `...` are passed to the `entry` function
                and an optional `options` table may be provided. Currently
                accepted `option` fields are `stack_size`.

                Returns: `luv_thread_t userdata` or `fail`

                Note: unsafe, please make sure that the thread's end of life
                is before Lua state is closed.

uv.thread_equal({thread}, {other_thread})                    *uv.thread_equal()*

                > method form `thread:equal(other_thread)`

                Parameters:
                - `thread`: `luv_thread_t userdata`
                - `other_thread`: `luv_thread_t userdata`

                Returns a boolean indicating whether two threads are the same.
                This function is equivalent to the `__eq` metamethod.

                Returns: `boolean`
                                                     *uv.thread_setaffinity()*
uv.thread_setaffinity({thread}, {affinity} [, {get_old_affinity}])

                > method form `thread:setaffinity(affinity, [get_old_affinity])`

                Parameters:
                - `thread`: `luv_thread_t userdata`
                - `affinity`: `table`
                  - `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` : `boolean`
                - `get_old_affinity`: `boolean`

                Sets the specified thread's affinity setting.

                `affinity` must be a table where each of the keys are a CPU
                number and the values are booleans that represent whether the
                `thread` should be eligible to run on that CPU. If the length
                of the `affinity` table is not greater than or equal to
                |uv.cpumask_size()|, any CPU numbers missing from the table
                will have their affinity set to `false`. If setting the
                affinity of more than |uv.cpumask_size()| CPUs is desired,
                `affinity` must be an array-like table with no gaps, since
                `#affinity` will be used as the `cpumask_size` if it is
                greater than |uv.cpumask_size()|.

                If `get_old_affinity` is `true`, the previous affinity
                settings for the `thread` will be returned. Otherwise, `true`
                is returned after a successful call.

                Note: Thread affinity setting is not atomic on Windows.
                Unsupported on macOS.

                Returns: `table` or `boolean` or `fail`
                - `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` : `boolean`


uv.thread_getaffinity({thread} [, {mask_size}])        *uv.thread_getaffinity()*

                > method form `thread:getaffinity([mask_size])`

                Parameters:
                - `thread`: `luv_thread_t userdata`
                - `mask_size`: `integer`

                Gets the specified thread's affinity setting.

                If `mask_size` is provided, it must be greater than or equal
                to `uv.cpumask_size()`. If the `mask_size` parameter is
                omitted, then the return of `uv.cpumask_size()` will be used.
                Returns an array-like table where each of the keys correspond
                to a CPU number and the values are booleans that represent
                whether the `thread` is eligible to run on that CPU.

                Note: Thread affinity getting is not atomic on Windows.
                Unsupported on macOS.

                Returns: `table` or `fail`
                - `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` : `boolean`

uv.thread_getcpu()                                          *uv.thread_getcpu()*

                Gets the CPU number on which the calling thread is running.

                Note: The first CPU will be returned as the number 1, not 0.
                This allows for the number to correspond with the table keys
                used in `uv.thread_getaffinity` and `uv.thread_setaffinity`.

                Returns: `integer` or `fail`

uv.thread_setpriority({thread}, {priority})            *uv.thread.setpriority()*

                > method form `thread:setpriority(priority)`

                Parameters:
                - `thread`: `luv_thread_t userdata`
                - `priority`: `number`

                Sets the specified thread's scheduling priority setting. It
                requires elevated privilege to set specific priorities on some
                platforms. The priority can be set to the following constants:

                priority is 0.

                Returns: `number` or `fail`

uv.thread_self()                                              *uv.thread_self()*

                - `thread`: `luv_thread_t userdata`

                Detaches a thread. Detached threads automatically release
                their resources upon termination, eliminating the need for the
                application to call `uv.thread_join`.

                Returns: `boolean` or `fail`

uv.thread_setname({name})                                  *uv.thread_setname()*

                Sets the name of the current thread. Different platforms
                define different limits on the max number of characters a
                thread name can be: Linux, IBM i (16), macOS (64), Windows
                (32767), and NetBSD (32), etc. The name will be truncated if
                `name` is larger than the limit of the platform.

                Returns: `0` or `fail`

uv.thread_getname({thread})                                *uv.thread_getname()*

                > method form `thread:getname()`

                Parameters:
                - `thread`: `luv_thread_t userdata`

                Gets the name of the thread specified by `thread`.

uv.sleep({msec})                                                    *uv.sleep()*

                Parameters:
                - `msec`: `integer`

                Pauses the thread in which this is called for a number of
                milliseconds.

                Returns: Nothing.

uv.new_sem([{value}])                                             *uv.new_sem()*

                Parameters:
                - `value`: `integer` or `nil`

                Creates a new semaphore with the specified initial value. A
                semaphore is safe to share across threads. It represents an
                unsigned integer value that can incremented and decremented
                atomically but any attempt to make it negative will "wait"
                until the value can be decremented by another thread
                incrementing it.

                The initial value must be a non-negative integer.

                Returns: `luv_sem_t userdata` or `fail`

                Note: A semaphore must be shared between threads, any
                `uv.sem_wait()` on a single thread that blocks will deadlock.

uv.sem_post({sem})                                               *uv.sem_post()*

                > method form `sem:post()`

                Parameters:
                - `sem`: `luv_sem_t userdata`

                Increments (unlocks) a semaphore, if the semaphore's value
                consequently becomes greater than zero then another thread
                blocked in a sem_wait call will be woken and proceed to
                decrement the semaphore.

                Returns: Nothing.

uv.sem_wait({sem})                                               *uv.sem_wait()*

                > method form `sem:wait()`

                Parameters:
                - `sem`: `luv_sem_t userdata`

                Decrements (locks) a semaphore, if the semaphore's value is
                greater than zero then the value is decremented and the call
                returns immediately. If the semaphore's value is zero then the
                call blocks until the semaphore's value rises above zero or
                the call is interrupted by a signal.

                Returns: Nothing.

uv.sem_trywait({sem})                                         *uv.sem_trywait()*

                > method form `sem:trywait()`

                Parameters:
                - `sem`: `luv_sem_t userdata`

                The same as `uv.sem_wait()` but returns immediately if the
                semaphore is not available.

                If the semaphore's value was decremented then `true` is
                returned, otherwise the semaphore has a value of zero and
                `false` is returned.

                Returns: `boolean`

                  version)
                  - `err`: `nil` or `string`
                  - `bytes`: `string` or `nil`

                Fills a string of length `len` with cryptographically strong
                random bytes acquired from the system CSPRNG. `flags` is
                reserved for future extension and must currently be `nil` or
                `0` or `{}`.

                Short reads are not possible. When less than `len` random
                bytes are available, a non-zero error value is returned or
                passed to the callback. If the callback is omitted, this
                function is completed synchronously.

                The synchronous version may block indefinitely when not enough
                entropy is available. The asynchronous version may not ever
                finish when the system is low on entropy.

                Returns (sync version): `string` or `fail`

                Returns (async version): `0` or `fail`

                - `errcode`: `integer`

                Returns the libuv error message and error name (both in string
                form, see `err` and `name` in |luv-error-handling|) equivalent
                to the given platform dependent error code: POSIX error codes
                on Unix (the ones stored in errno), and Win32 error codes on
                Windows (those returned by GetLastError() or
                WSAGetLastError()).

                Returns: `string, string` or `nil`

METRICS OPERATIONS                                      *luv-metrics-operations*

uv.metrics_idle_time()                                  *uv.metrics_idle_time()*

                Retrieve the amount of time the event loop has been idle in
                the kernel’s event provider (e.g. `epoll_wait`). The call is
                thread safe.

                The return value is the accumulated time spent idle in the
                kernel’s event provider starting from when the |uv_loop_t| was
                configured to collect the idle time.

                Note: The event loop will not begin accumulating the event
                provider’s idle time until calling `loop_configure` with
                `"metrics_idle_time"`.

                Returns: `number`

uv.metrics_info()                                            *uv.metrics_info()*

                Get the metrics table from current set of event loop metrics.
                It is recommended to retrieve these metrics in a `prepare`
                callback (see |uv.new_prepare()|, |uv.prepare_start()|) in order
                to make sure there are no inconsistencies with the metrics
                counters.

                Returns: `table`

                - `loop_count` : `integer`
                - `events` : `integer`
                - `events_waiting` : `integer`

STRING MANIPULATION FUNCTIONS                          *luv-string-manipulation*

These string utilities are needed internally for dealing with Windows, and are
exported to allow clients to work uniformly with this data when the libuv API
is not complete.

Notes:
1. New in luv version 1.49.0.
2. See the WTF-8 spec (https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/) for information
   about WTF-8.
3. Luv uses Lua-style strings, which means that all inputs and return values
   (UTF-8 or UTF-16 strings) do not include a NUL terminator.

uv.utf16_length_as_wtf8({utf16})                     *uv.utf16_length_as_wtf8()*

                Get the length (in bytes) of a UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string
                `utf16` value after converting it to WTF-8. The endianness of
                the UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string is assumed to be the same as the
                native endianness of the platform.

                Parameters:
                - `utf16`: `string`

                Returns: `integer`

uv.utf16_to_wtf8({utf16})                                   *uv.utf16_to_wtf8()*

                Convert UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string `utf16` to UTF-8 string. The
                endianness of the UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string is assumed to be
                the same as the native endianness of the platform.

                Parameters:
                - `utf16`: `string`

                Returns: `string`

uv.wtf8_length_as_utf16({wtf16})                     *uv.wtf8_length_as_utf16()*

                Get the length (in UTF-16 code units) of a WTF-8 `wtf8` value
                after converting it to UTF-16 (or UCS-2).

                Note: The number of bytes needed for a UTF-16 (or UCS-2)
                string is `<number of code units> * 2`.

                Parameters:
                - `wtf8`: `string`

                Returns: `integer`

uv.wtf8_to_utf16({wtf16})                                   *uv.wtf8_to_utf16()*

                Convert WTF-8 string in `wtf8` to UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string.
                The endianness of the UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string is assumed to
                be the same as the native endianness of the platform.

                Parameters:
                - `wtf8`: `string`

                Returns: `string`
