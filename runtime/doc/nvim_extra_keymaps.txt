EXTRA KEYMAPS FOR NVIM                                      *nvim-extra-keymaps*

The `plugin/extra-keymaps.vim` script provides a few extra keymaps that might
be useful and tries to fix some issues the community has identified with vim's
default keymaps.

This plugin can be disabled by addinf the following to your |vimrc|: >

    let g:nvim#defaults#maps#use = 0

Additionally, all features can be disabled separately, using the variables
described below.

The keymaps provided are:

			 *t_<Esc><Esc>*  *gr:nvim#defaults#maps#leave_term_mode*
1. <Esc><Esc> leaves terminal-mode (see |nvim-terminal-emulator|), like
   CTRL-\ CTRL-N (see |CTRL-\_CTRL-N|).

					    *Y-eol* *g:nvim#defaults#maps#Y_eol*
2. |Y| yanks to the end of line, which is more consistent with |cc| and |C|,
   for example.

				*undo-ctrl-u* *g:nvim#defaults#maps#undo_ctrl_u*
3. <C-u> can be undone. (see |i_CTRL-U|)

				  *smart-home* *g:nvim#defaults#maps#smart_home*
4. <Home> moves the cursor to the first non-blank character of the line on
   first press (like |^|), and the first character of the line on second (like
   |0|). It alternates afterwards.
