							*cscope* *Cscope*
Cscope is a "code intelligence" tool that helps you navigate C programs. It
can also perform some refactoring tasks, such as renaming a global variable in
all source files.  Think of it as "ctags on steroids".

See |cscope-usage| for a quickstart.

Cscope introduction					*cscope-intro*


Cscope is designed to answer questions like:
       Where is this symbol used?
       Where is it defined?
       Where did this variable get its value?
       What is this global symbol's definition?
       Where is this function in the source files?
       What functions call this function?
       What functions are called by this function?
       Where does the message "out of space" come from?
       Where is this source file in the directory structure?
       What files include this header file?

Cscope answers these questions from a symbol database that it builds the first
time it is used on the source files.  On a subsequent call, cscope rebuilds
the database only if a source file has changed or the list of source files is
different.  When the database is rebuilt the data for the unchanged files is
copied from the old database, which makes rebuilding much faster than the
initial build.

See |cscope-usage| to get started.

Cscope commands						*cscope-commands*

		*:cscope* *:cs* *:scs* *:scscope* *E259* *E262* *E561* *E560*
All cscope commands are accessed through suboptions to the cscope commands.
	`:cscope` or `:cs` is the main command
	`:scscope` or `:scs` does the same and splits the window
	`:lcscope` or `:lcs` uses the location list, see |:lcscope|

The available subcommands are:

			*E563* *E564* *E566* *E568* *E622* *E623* *E625*
			*E626* *E609*
    add   : Add a new cscope database/connection.

	USAGE	:cs add {file|dir} [pre-path] [flags]

	    [pre-path] is the pathname used with the -P command to cscope.

	    [flags] are any additional flags you want to pass to cscope.

	EXAMPLES >
	    :cscope add /usr/local/cdb/cscope.out
	    :cscope add /projects/vim/cscope.out /usr/local/vim
	    :cscope add cscope.out /usr/local/vim -C
<
				      *cscope-find* *cs-find* *E567*
    find  : Query cscope.  All cscope query options are available
	    except option #5 ("Change this grep pattern").

	USAGE	:cs find {querytype} {name}

	    {querytype} corresponds to the actual cscope line
	    interface numbers as well as default nvi commands:

		0 or s: Find this C symbol
		1 or g: Find this definition
		2 or d: Find functions called by this function
		3 or c: Find functions calling this function
		4 or t: Find this text string
		6 or e: Find this egrep pattern
		7 or f: Find this file
		8 or i: Find files #including this file
		9 or a: Find places where this symbol is assigned a value

	For all types, except 4 and 6, leading white space for {name} is
	removed.  For 4 and 6 there is exactly one space between {querytype}
	and {name}.  Further white space is included in {name}.

	EXAMPLES >
	    :cscope find c vim_free
	    :cscope find 3  vim_free
<
	    These two examples perform the same query: functions calling
	    "vim_free". >

	    :cscope find t initOnce
	    :cscope find t  initOnce
<
	    The first one searches for the text "initOnce", the second one for
	    " initOnce". >

	    :cscope find 0 DEFAULT_TERM
<
	    Executing this example on the source code for Vim 5.1 produces the
	    following output:

	    Cscope tag: DEFAULT_TERM
	       #   line  filename / context / line
	       1   1009  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<GLOBAL>>

			 #define DEFAULT_TERM (char_u *)"mac-ansi"
	      11   1335  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<set_termname>>
			 term = DEFAULT_TERM;
	      12   1459  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<set_termname>>
			 if (STRCMP(term, DEFAULT_TERM))
	      13   1826  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<termcapinit>>
			 term = DEFAULT_TERM;
	      14   1833  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<termcapinit>>
			 term = DEFAULT_TERM;
	      15   3635  vim-5.1-gtk/src/term.c <<update_tcap>>
			 p = find_builtin_term(DEFAULT_TERM);
	    Enter nr of choice (<CR> to abort):

	    The output shows several pieces of information:
	    1. The tag number (there are 15 in this example).
	    2. The line number where the tag occurs.
	    3. The filename where the tag occurs.
	    4. The context of the tag (e.g., global, or the function name).
	    5. The line from the file itself.

    help  : Show a brief synopsis.

	    USAGE   :cs help

							*E261*
    kill  : Kill a cscope connection (or kill all cscope connections).

	    USAGE   :cs kill {num|partial_name}

	    To kill a cscope connection, the connection number or a partial
	    name must be specified.  The partial name is simply any part of
	    the pathname of the cscope database.  Kill a cscope connection
	    using the partial name with caution!

	    If the specified connection number is -1, then _ALL_ cscope
	    connections will be killed.

    reset : Reinit all cscope connections.

	    USAGE   :cs reset

    show  : Show cscope connections.

	    USAGE   :cs show

							*:lcscope* *:lcs*
This command is same as the ":cscope" command, except when the
'cscopequickfix' option is set, the location list for the current window is
used instead of the quickfix list to show the cscope results.

							*:cstag* *E257* *E562*
If you use cscope as well as ctags, |:cstag| allows you to search one or
the other before making a jump.  For example, you can choose to first
search your cscope database(s) for a match, and if one is not found, then
your tags file(s) will be searched.  The order in which this happens
is determined by the value of |csto|.  See |cscope-options| for more
details.

|:cstag| performs the equivalent of ":cs find g" on the identifier when
searching through the cscope database(s).

|:cstag| performs the equivalent of |:tjump| on the identifier when searching
through your tags file(s).


==============================================================================
Cscope options						*cscope-options*

Use the |:set| command to set all cscope options.  Ideally, you would do
this in one of your startup files (e.g., vimrc).  Some cscope related
variables are only valid within |init.vim|.  Setting them after vim has
started will have no effect!

							*cscopeprg* *csprg*
'cscopeprg' specifies the command to execute cscope.  The default is
"cscope".  For example: >
	:set csprg=/usr/local/bin/cscope
<
					    *cscopequickfix* *csqf* *E469*
'cscopequickfix' specifies whether to use quickfix window to show cscope
results.  This is a list of comma-separated values. Each item consists of
|cscope-find| command (s, g, d, c, t, e, f, i or a) and flag (+, - or 0).
'+' indicates that results must be appended to quickfix window,
'-' implies previous results clearance, '0' or command absence - don't use
quickfix.  Search is performed from start until first command occurrence.
The default value is "" (don't use quickfix anyway).  The following value
seems to be useful: >
	:set cscopequickfix=s-,c-,d-,i-,t-,e-,a-
<
							*cscopetag* *cst*
If 'cscopetag' is set, the commands ":tag" and CTRL-] as well as "vim -t"
will always use |:cstag| instead of the default :tag behavior.  Effectively,
by setting 'cst', you will always search your cscope databases as well as
your tag files.  The default is off.

							*cscoperelative* *csre*
If 'cscoperelative' is set, then in absence of a prefix given to cscope
(prefix is the argument of -P option of cscope), basename of cscope.out
location (usually the project root directory) will be used as the prefix
to construct an absolute path.  The default is off.  Note: This option is
only effective when cscope (cscopeprg) is initialized without a prefix
path (-P).

							*cscopetagorder* *csto*
The value of 'csto' determines the order in which |:cstag| performs a search.
If 'csto' is set to zero, cscope database(s) are searched first, followed
by tag file(s) if cscope did not return any matches.  If 'csto' is set to
one, tag file(s) are searched before cscope database(s).  The default is zero.

						      *cscopepathcomp* *cspc*
'cscopepathcomp' determines how many components of a file's path to display.
With the default value of zero the entire path will be displayed.
The value one will display only the filename with no path.  Other values
display that many components.  For example: >
	:set cscopepathcomp=3
will display the last 3 components of the file's path, including the file
name itself.

==============================================================================
Using cscope in Nvim			*cscope-usage* *cscope-howtouse*

To get started, build the cscope database in your project root directory: >
	cscope -bcqR

See the cscope manpage for details: >
	:Man cscope

By default the cscope database file is named "cscope.out". After building the
database, connect to it from Nvim: >
	:cscope add cscope.out

That establishes a cscope connection for Nvim to use.  You can check the
result with ":cs show".  It will show something like:

 # pid	  database name			      prepend path
 0 28806  cscope.out			      <none>

Once a cscope connection is established, you can make queries to cscope and
the results will be printed.  Queries are made using the command ":cs find".
For example: >
	:cs find g ALIGN_SIZE

To make this easier you can configure mappings, see |cscope-suggestions|.

If the results return only one match, you will automatically be taken to it.
If there is more than one match, you will be given a selection screen to pick
the match you want to go to.  After you have jumped to the new location,
simply hit Ctrl-T to get back to the previous one.


==============================================================================
Limitations						*cscope-limitations*

Hard-coded limitation: doing a |:tjump| when |:cstag| searches the tag files
is not configurable (e.g., you can't do a tselect instead).


==============================================================================
Sample config						*cscope-suggestions*

Copy this into your init.vim (adjust paths for your system): >

	if has("cscope")
		set csprg=/usr/local/bin/cscope
		set csto=0
		set cst
		" add any database in current directory
		if filereadable("cscope.out")
		    silent cs add cscope.out
		" else add database pointed to by environment
		elseif $CSCOPE_DB != ""
		    silent cs add $CSCOPE_DB
		endif
	endif

By setting 'cscopetag', we have effectively replaced all instances of the :tag
command with :cstag.  This includes :tag, Ctrl-], and "vim -t".  In doing
this, the regular tag command not only searches your ctags generated tag
files, but your cscope databases as well.

Some users may want to keep the regular tag behavior and have a different
shortcut to access :cstag.  For example, one could map Ctrl-_  (underscore)
to :cstag with the following command: >

	map <C-_> :cstag <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

A couple of very commonly used cscope queries (using ":cs find") is to
find all functions calling a certain function and to find all occurrences
of a particular C symbol.  To do this, you can use these mappings as an
example: >

	map g<C-]> :cs find 3 <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	map g<C-\> :cs find 0 <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

These mappings for Ctrl-] (right bracket) and Ctrl-\ (backslash) allow you to
place your cursor over the function name or C symbol and quickly query cscope
for any matches.

Or you may use the following scheme, inspired by Vim/Cscope tutorial from
Cscope Home Page (http://cscope.sourceforge.net/): >

	nmap <C-_>s :cs find s <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>g :cs find g <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>c :cs find c <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>t :cs find t <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>e :cs find e <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>f :cs find f <C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>i :cs find i ^<C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR>$<CR>
	nmap <C-_>d :cs find d <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>a :cs find a <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

	" Using 'CTRL-spacebar' then a search type makes the vim window
	" split horizontally, with search result displayed in
	" the new window.

	nmap <C-Space>s :scs find s <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>g :scs find g <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>c :scs find c <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>t :scs find t <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>e :scs find e <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>f :scs find f <C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>i :scs find i ^<C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR>$<CR>
	nmap <C-Space>d :scs find d <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>a :scs find a <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

	" Hitting CTRL-space *twice* before the search type does a vertical
	" split instead of a horizontal one

	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>s
		\:vert scs find s <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>g
		\:vert scs find g <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>c
		\:vert scs find c <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>t
		\:vert scs find t <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>e
		\:vert scs find e <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>i
		\:vert scs find i ^<C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR>$<CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>d
		\:vert scs find d <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>a
		\:vert scs find a <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
