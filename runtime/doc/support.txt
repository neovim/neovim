Support types ~

* Tier 1: Officially supported and tested with CI. Any contributed patch
  MUST NOT break such systems.

* Tier 2: Officially supported, but not necessarily tested with CI. These
  systems are maintained to the best of our ability, without being a top
  priority.

* Tier 3: Not tested and no guarantees, but may work.

Adding support for a new platform ~

IMPORTANT: Before attempting to add support for a new platform please open
an issue about it for discussion.


==============================================================================
Common

Some common notes when adding support for new platforms:

Cmake is the only supported build system. The platform must be buildable with cmake.

All functionality related to the new platform must be implemented in its own
file inside `src/nvim/os` unless it's already done in a common file, in which
case adding an `#ifdef` is fine.
