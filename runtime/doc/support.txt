(NOT "OS Build").

Support types ~

* Tier 1: Officially supported and tested with CI. Any contributed patch
  MUST NOT break support for such platforms.

* Tier 2: Officially supported, but not necessarily tested with CI. Support
  for these platforms are maintained by best effort, without being a top
  priority.

* Tier 3: Not tested and no guarantees, and not all features may work.

Adding support for a new platform ~

IMPORTANT: Before attempting to add support for a new platform please open
an issue about it for discussion.


==============================================================================
Common

Some common notes when adding support for new platforms:

CMake is the only supported build system. Nvim must be buildable on the
platform with CMake.

All functionality related to the new platform must be implemented in its own
file inside `src/nvim/os` unless it's already done in a common file, in which
case adding an `#ifdef` is fine.
