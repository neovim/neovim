Nvim API							   *API* *api*

Nvim exposes a powerful API that can be used by plugins and external processes
via |RPC|, |Lua| and VimL (|eval-api|).

Applications can also embed libnvim to work with the C API directly.

                                      Type |gO| to see the table of contents.

==============================================================================
API Usage						*api-rpc* *RPC* *rpc*

							*msgpack-rpc*
RPC is the typical way to control Nvim programmatically.  Nvim implements the
MessagePack-RPC protocol:
  https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc/blob/master/spec.md
  https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/0b8f5ac/spec.md

Many clients use the API: user interfaces (GUIs), remote plugins, scripts like
"nvr" (https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote).  Even Nvim itself can control
other Nvim instances.  API clients can:

  - Call any API function
  - Listen for events
  - Receive remote calls from Nvim

The RPC API is like a more powerful version of Vim's "clientserver" feature.

CONNECTING						*rpc-connecting*

See |channel-intro| for various ways to open a channel. Channel-opening
functions take an `rpc` key in the options dictionary. RPC channels can also
be opened by other processes connecting to TCP/IP sockets or named pipes
listened to by Nvim.

Nvim creates a default RPC socket at |startup|, given by |v:servername|. To
start with a TCP/IP socket instead, use |--listen| with a TCP-style address: >
    nvim --listen 127.0.0.1:6666
More endpoints can be started with |serverstart()|.

Note that localhost TCP sockets are generally less secure than named pipes,
and can lead to vunerabilities like remote code execution.

Connecting to the socket is the easiest way a programmer can test the API,
which can be done through any msgpack-rpc client library or full-featured
|api-client|. Here's a Ruby script that prints "hello world!" in the current
Nvim instance:
>
    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    # Requires msgpack-rpc: gem install msgpack-rpc
    #
    # To run this script, execute it from a running Nvim instance (notice the
    # trailing '&' which is required since Nvim won't process events while
    # running a blocking command):
    #
    #	:!./hello.rb &
    #
    # Or from another shell by setting NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS:
    # $ NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS=[address] ./hello.rb

    require 'msgpack/rpc'
    require 'msgpack/rpc/transport/unix'

    nvim = MessagePack::RPC::Client.new(MessagePack::RPC::UNIXTransport.new, ENV['NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS'])
    result = nvim.call(:nvim_command, 'echo "hello world!"')
<
A better way is to use the Python REPL with the "pynvim" package, where API
functions can be called interactively:
>
    >>> from pynvim import attach
    >>> nvim = attach('socket', path='[address]')
    >>> nvim.command('echo "hello world!"')
<
You can also embed Nvim via |jobstart()|, and communicate using |rpcrequest()|
and |rpcnotify()|:
>
    let nvim = jobstart(['nvim', '--embed'], {'rpc': v:true})
    echo rpcrequest(nvim, 'nvim_eval', '"Hello " . "world!"')
    call jobstop(nvim)

==============================================================================
API Definitions						*api-definitions*

							*api-types*
The Nvim C API defines custom types for all function parameters. Some are just
typedefs around C99 standard types, others are Nvim-defined data structures.

Basic types ~

  API Type				C type
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Nil
  Boolean				bool
  Integer (signed 64-bit integer)	int64_t
  Float (IEEE 754 double precision)	double
  String				{char* data, size_t size} struct
  Array
  Dictionary (msgpack: map)
  Object

  Note: empty Array is accepted as a valid argument for Dictionary parameter.

Special types (msgpack EXT) ~

  These are integer typedefs discriminated as separate Object subtypes. They
  can be treated as opaque integers, but are mutually incompatible: Buffer may
  be passed as an integer but not as Window or Tabpage.

  The EXT object data is the (integer) object handle. The EXT type codes given
  in the |api-metadata| `types` key are stable: they will not change and are
  thus forward-compatible.

  EXT Type	C type					Data
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Buffer	enum value kObjectTypeBuffer		|bufnr()|
  Window	enum value kObjectTypeWindow		|window-ID|
  Tabpage	enum value kObjectTypeTabpage		internal handle


							*api-indexing*
Most of the API uses 0-based indices, and ranges are end-exclusive. For the
end of a range, -1 denotes the last line/column.

Exception: the following API functions use "mark-like" indexing (1-based
lines, 0-based columns):

    |nvim_buf_get_mark()|
    |nvim_win_get_cursor()|
    |nvim_win_set_cursor()|

Exception: the following API functions use |extmarks| indexing (0-based
indices, end-inclusive):

    |nvim_buf_del_extmark()|
    |nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id()|
    |nvim_buf_get_extmarks()|
    |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|

							*api-fast*
Most API functions are "deferred": they are queued on the main loop and
processed sequentially with normal input.  So if the editor is waiting for
user input in a "modal" fashion (e.g. the |hit-enter-prompt|), the request
will block.  Non-deferred ({fast}) functions such as |nvim_get_mode()| and
|nvim_input()| are served immediately (i.e. without waiting in the input
queue).  Lua code can use |vim.in_fast_event()| to detect a {fast} context.

==============================================================================
API metadata						*api-metadata*

The Nvim C API is automatically exposed to RPC by the build system, which
parses headers in src/nvim/api/* and generates dispatch-functions mapping RPC
API method names to public C API functions, converting/validating arguments
and return values.

Nvim exposes its API metadata as a Dictionary with these items:

version			Nvim version, API level/compatibility
version.api_level	API version integer *api-level*
version.api_compatible	API is backwards-compatible with this level
version.api_prerelease	Declares the API as unstable/unreleased >
			(version.api_prerelease && fn.since == version.api_level)
functions		API function signatures, containing |api-types| info
                        describing the return value and parameters.
ui_events		|UI| event signatures
ui_options		Supported |ui-option|s
{fn}.since		API level where function {fn} was introduced
{fn}.deprecated_since	API level where function {fn} was deprecated
types			Custom handle types defined by Nvim
error_types		Possible error types returned by API functions

About the `functions` map:

  - Container types may be decorated with type/size constraints, e.g.
    ArrayOf(Buffer) or ArrayOf(Integer, 2).
  - Functions considered to be methods that operate on instances of Nvim
    special types (msgpack EXT) have the "method=true" flag. The receiver type
    is that of the first argument. Method names are prefixed with `nvim_` plus
    a type name, e.g. `nvim_buf_get_lines` is the `get_lines` method of
    a Buffer instance. |dev-api|
  - Global functions have the "method=false" flag and are prefixed with just
    `nvim_`, e.g. `nvim_get_buffers`.

							*api-mapping*
External programs (clients) can use the metadata to discover the API, using
any of these approaches:

  1. Connect to a running Nvim instance and call |nvim_get_api_info()| via
     msgpack-RPC. This is best for clients written in dynamic languages which
     can define functions at runtime.

  2. Start Nvim with |--api-info|. Useful for statically-compiled clients.
     Example (requires Python "pyyaml" and "msgpack-python" modules): >
     nvim --api-info | python -c 'import msgpack, sys, yaml; print yaml.dump(msgpack.unpackb(sys.stdin.read()))'
<
  3. Use the |api_info()| Vimscript function. >
     :lua print(vim.inspect(vim.fn.api_info()))
<     Example using |filter()| to exclude non-deprecated API functions: >
     :new|put =map(filter(api_info().functions, '!has_key(v:val,''deprecated_since'')'), 'v:val.name')

==============================================================================
API contract                                                     *api-contract*

The Nvim API is composed of functions and events.

- Clients call functions like those described at |api-global|.
- Clients can subscribe to |ui-events|, |api-buffer-updates|, etc.
- API function names are prefixed with "nvim_".
- API event names are prefixed with "nvim_" and suffixed with "_event".

As Nvim evolves the API may change in compliance with this CONTRACT:

- New functions and events may be added.
  - Any such extensions are OPTIONAL: old clients may ignore them.
- Function signatures will NOT CHANGE (after release).
  - Functions introduced in the development (unreleased) version MAY CHANGE.
    (Clients can dynamically check `api_prerelease`, etc. |api-metadata|)
- Event parameters will not be removed or reordered (after release).
- Events may be EXTENDED: new parameters may be added.
- New items may be ADDED to map/list parameters/results of functions and
  events.
  - Any such new items are OPTIONAL: old clients may ignore them.
  - Existing items will not be removed (after release).
- Deprecated functions will not be removed until Nvim version 2.0

==============================================================================
Global events						    *api-global-events*

When a client invokes an API request as an async notification, it is not
possible for Nvim to send an error response. Instead, in case of error, the
following notification will be sent to the client:

                                                             *nvim_error_event*
nvim_error_event[{type}, {message}]

{type} is a numeric id as defined by `api_info().error_types`, and {message} is
a string with the error message.

==============================================================================
Buffer update events					*api-buffer-updates*

API clients can "attach" to Nvim buffers to subscribe to buffer update events.
This is similar to |TextChanged| but more powerful and granular.

Call |nvim_buf_attach()| to receive these events on the channel:

                                                        *nvim_buf_lines_event*
nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, {firstline}, {lastline}, {linedata}, {more}]

  When the buffer text between {firstline} and {lastline} (end-exclusive,
  zero-indexed) were changed to the new text in the {linedata} list. The
  granularity is a line, i.e. if a single character is changed in the editor,
  the entire line is sent.

  When {changedtick} is |v:null| this means the screen lines (display) changed
  but not the buffer contents. {linedata} contains the changed screen lines.
  This happens when 'inccommand' shows a buffer preview.

  Properties:~
    {buf} API buffer handle (buffer number)

    {changedtick} value of |b:changedtick| for the buffer. If you send an API
    command back to nvim you can check the value of |b:changedtick| as part of
    your request to ensure that no other changes have been made.

    {firstline} integer line number of the first line that was replaced.
    Zero-indexed: if line 1 was replaced then {firstline} will be 0, not 1.
    {firstline} is always less than or equal to the number of lines that were
    in the buffer before the lines were replaced.

    {lastline} integer line number of the first line that was not replaced
    (i.e. the range {firstline}, {lastline} is end-exclusive).
    Zero-indexed: if line numbers 2 to 5 were replaced, this will be 5 instead
    of 6. {lastline} is always be less than or equal to the number of lines
    that were in the buffer before the lines were replaced. {lastline} will be
    -1 if the event is part of the initial update after attaching.

    {linedata} list of strings containing the contents of the new buffer
    lines. Newline characters are omitted; empty lines are sent as empty
    strings.

    {more} boolean, true for a "multipart" change notification: the current
    change was chunked into multiple |nvim_buf_lines_event| notifications
    (e.g. because it was too big).

nvim_buf_changedtick_event[{buf}, {changedtick}]  *nvim_buf_changedtick_event*

  When |b:changedtick| was incremented but no text was changed. Relevant for
  undo/redo.

  Properties:~
    {buf} API buffer handle (buffer number)
    {changedtick} new value of |b:changedtick| for the buffer

nvim_buf_detach_event[{buf}]                           *nvim_buf_detach_event*

  When buffer is detached (i.e. updates are disabled). Triggered explicitly by
  |nvim_buf_detach()| or implicitly in these cases:
  - Buffer was |abandon|ed and 'hidden' is not set.
  - Buffer was reloaded, e.g. with |:edit| or an external change triggered
    |:checktime| or 'autoread'.
  - Generally: whenever the buffer contents are unloaded from memory.

EXAMPLE ~

Calling |nvim_buf_attach()| with send_buffer=true on an empty buffer, emits: >
  nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 0, -1, [""], v:false]

User adds two lines to the buffer, emits: >
  nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 0, 0, ["line1", "line2"], v:false]

User moves to a line containing the text "Hello world" and inserts "!", emits: >
  nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, {linenr}, {linenr} + 1,
                       ["Hello world!"], v:false]

User moves to line 3 and deletes 20 lines using "20dd", emits: >
  nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 2, 22, [], v:false]

User selects lines 3-5 using |linewise-visual| mode and then types "p" to
paste a block of 6 lines, emits: >
  nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 2, 5,
    ['pasted line 1', 'pasted line 2', 'pasted line 3', 'pasted line 4',
     'pasted line 5', 'pasted line 6'],
    v:false
  ]

User reloads the buffer with ":edit", emits: >
  nvim_buf_detach_event[{buf}]
<

LUA ~
                                                        *api-buffer-updates-lua*
In-process Lua plugins can receive buffer updates in the form of Lua
callbacks. These callbacks are called frequently in various contexts;
|textlock| prevents changing buffer contents and window layout (use
|vim.schedule| to defer such operations to the main loop instead).

|nvim_buf_attach()| will take keyword args for the callbacks. "on_lines" will
receive parameters ("lines", {buf}, {changedtick}, {firstline}, {lastline},
{new_lastline}, {old_byte_size}[, {old_utf32_size}, {old_utf16_size}]).
Unlike remote channel events the text contents are not passed. The new text can
be accessed inside the callback as

    `vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(buf, firstline, new_lastline, true)`

{old_byte_size} is the total size of the replaced region {firstline} to
{lastline} in bytes, including the final newline after {lastline}. if
`utf_sizes` is set to true in |nvim_buf_attach()| keyword args, then the
UTF-32 and UTF-16 sizes of the deleted region is also passed as additional
arguments {old_utf32_size} and {old_utf16_size}.

"on_changedtick" is invoked when |b:changedtick| was incremented but no text
was changed. The parameters recieved are ("changedtick", {buf}, {changedtick}).

                                                        *api-lua-detach*
In-process Lua callbacks can detach by returning `true`. This will detach all
callbacks attached with the same |nvim_buf_attach()| call.


==============================================================================
Buffer highlighting					       *api-highlights*

Nvim allows plugins to add position-based highlights to buffers. This is
similar to |matchaddpos()| but with some key differences. The added highlights
are associated with a buffer and adapts to line insertions and deletions,
similar to signs. It is also possible to manage a set of highlights as a group
and delete or replace all at once.

The intended use case are linter or semantic highlighter plugins that monitor
a buffer for changes, and in the background compute highlights to the buffer.
Another use case are plugins that show output in an append-only buffer, and
want to add highlights to the outputs. Highlight data cannot be preserved
on writing and loading a buffer to file, nor in undo/redo cycles.

Highlights are registered using the |nvim_buf_add_highlight()| function. If an
external highlighter plugin wants to add many highlights in a batch,
performance can be improved by calling |nvim_buf_add_highlight()| as an
asynchronous notification, after first (synchronously) requesting a source id.

Example using the Python API client (|pynvim|):
>
    src = vim.new_highlight_source()
    buf = vim.current.buffer
    for i in range(5):
        buf.add_highlight("String",i,0,-1,src_id=src)
    # some time later ...
    buf.clear_namespace(src)
<
If the highlights don't need to be deleted or updated, just pass -1 as
src_id (this is the default in python). Use |nvim_buf_clear_namespace()| to
clear highlights from a specific source, in a specific line range or the
entire buffer by passing in the line range 0, -1 (the latter is the default in
python as used above).

Example using the API from Vimscript: >

    call nvim_buf_set_lines(0, 0, 0, v:true, ["test text"])
    let src = nvim_buf_add_highlight(0, 0, "String", 1, 0, 4)
    call nvim_buf_add_highlight(0, src, "Identifier", 0, 5, -1)
    " some time later ...
    call nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, src, 0, -1)


==============================================================================
Floating windows						 *api-floatwin*

Floating windows ("floats") are displayed on top of normal windows.  This is
useful to implement simple widgets, such as tooltips displayed next to the
cursor. Floats are fully functional windows supporting user editing, common
|api-window| calls, and most window options (except 'statusline').

Two ways to create a floating window:
- |nvim_open_win()| creates a new window (needs a buffer, see |nvim_create_buf()|)
- |nvim_win_set_config()| reconfigures a normal window into a float

To close it use |nvim_win_close()| or a command such as |:close|.

Buffer text can be highlighted by typical mechanisms (syntax highlighting,
|api-highlights|). The |hl-NormalFloat| group highlights normal text;
'winhighlight' can be used as usual to override groups locally. Floats inherit
options from the current window; specify `style=minimal` in |nvim_open_win()|
to disable various visual features such as the 'number' column.

Currently, floating windows don't support some widgets like scrollbar.

Example: create a float with scratch buffer: >

    let buf = nvim_create_buf(v:false, v:true)
    call nvim_buf_set_lines(buf, 0, -1, v:true, ["test", "text"])
    let opts = {'relative': 'cursor', 'width': 10, 'height': 2, 'col': 0,
        \ 'row': 1, 'anchor': 'NW', 'style': 'minimal'}
    let win = nvim_open_win(buf, 0, opts)
    " optional: change highlight, otherwise Pmenu is used
    call nvim_win_set_option(win, 'winhl', 'Normal:MyHighlight')
>

==============================================================================
Extended marks					*api-extended-marks* *extmarks*

Extended marks (extmarks) represent buffer annotations that track text changes
in the buffer. They can represent cursors, folds, misspelled words, anything
that needs to track a logical location in the buffer over time. |api-indexing|

Extmark position works like "bar" cursor: it exists between characters. Thus
the maximum extmark index on a line is 1 more than the character index: >

     f o o b a r      line contents
     0 1 2 3 4 5      character positions (0-based)
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6     extmark positions (0-based)

Extmarks have "forward gravity": if you place the cursor directly on an
extmark position and enter some text, the extmark migrates forward. >

     f o o|b a r      line (| = cursor)
          3           extmark

     f o o z|b a r    line (| = cursor)
            4         extmark (after typing "z")

If an extmark is on the last index of a line and you inputsa newline at that
point, the extmark will accordingly migrate to the next line: >

     f o o z b a r|   line (| = cursor)
                  7   extmark

     f o o z b a r    first line
                      extmarks (none present)
     |                second line (| = cursor)
     0                extmark (after typing <CR>)


Example:

Let's set an extmark at the first row (row=0) and third column (column=2).
|api-indexing| Passing id=0 creates a new mark and returns the id: >

      01 2345678
    0 ex|ample..
<        ^ extmark position
>
    let g:mark_ns = nvim_create_namespace('myplugin')
    let g:mark_id = nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, g:mark_ns, 0, 2, {})
<
We can get the mark by its id: >

    echo nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id(0, g:mark_ns, g:mark_id, {})
    => [0, 2]

We can get all marks in a buffer by |namespace| (or by a range): >

    echo nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, g:mark_ns, 0, -1, {})
    => [[1, 0, 2]]

Deleting all surrounding text does NOT remove an extmark! To remove extmarks
use |nvim_buf_del_extmark()|. Deleting "x" in our example: >

      0 12345678
    0 e|ample..
<       ^ extmark position
>
    echo nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id(0, g:mark_ns, g:mark_id, {})
    => [0, 1]
<
    Note: Extmark "gravity" decides how it will shift after a text edit.
          See |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|

Namespaces allow any plugin to manage only its own extmarks, ignoring those
created by another plugin.

Extmark positions changed by an edit will be restored on undo/redo. Creating
and deleting extmarks is not a buffer change, thus new undo states are not
created for extmark changes.

                Parameters: ~
                    {flt}  Value to return.

                Return: ~
                    its argument.

nvim__screenshot({path})                                  *nvim__screenshot()*
                TODO: Documentation

                Attributes: ~

nvim__set_hl_ns({ns_id})                                   *nvim__set_hl_ns()*
                Set active namespace for highlights.

                NB: this function can be called from async contexts, but the
                semantics are not yet well-defined. To start with
                |nvim_set_decoration_provider| on_win and on_line callbacks
                are explicitly allowed to change the namespace during a redraw
                cycle.

                Attributes: ~
                    {fast}

                Parameters: ~
                    {ns_id}  the namespace to activate

nvim__stats()                                                  *nvim__stats()*
                Gets internal stats.

                Return: ~
                    Map of various internal stats.

nvim_call_atomic({calls})                                 *nvim_call_atomic()*
                Calls many API methods atomically.

                This has two main usages:
                1. To perform several requests from an async context
                   atomically, i.e. without interleaving redraws, RPC requests
                   from other clients, or user interactions (however API
                   methods may trigger autocommands or event processing which
                   have such side-effects, e.g. |:sleep| may wake timers).
                2. To minimize RPC overhead (roundtrips) of a sequence of many
                   requests.

                Parameters: ~
                    {calls}  an array of calls, where each call is described
                             by an array with two elements: the request name,
                             and an array of arguments.

                Return: ~
                    Array of two elements. The first is an array of return
                    values. The second is NIL if all calls succeeded. If a
                    call resulted in an error, it is a three-element array
                    with the zero-based index of the call which resulted in an
                    error, the error type and the error message. If an error
                    occurred, the values from all preceding calls will still
                    be returned.

                                                   *nvim_call_dict_function()*
nvim_call_dict_function({dict}, {fn}, {args})
                Calls a VimL |Dictionary-function| with the given arguments.

                On execution error: fails with VimL error, does not update
                v:errmsg.

                Parameters: ~
                    {dict}  Dictionary, or String evaluating to a VimL |self|
                            dict
                    {fn}    Name of the function defined on the VimL dict
                    {args}  Function arguments packed in an Array

                Return: ~
                    Result of the function call

nvim_call_function({fn}, {args})                        *nvim_call_function()*
                Calls a VimL function with the given arguments.

                On execution error: fails with VimL error, does not update
                v:errmsg.

                Parameters: ~
                    {fn}    Function to call
                    {args}  Function arguments packed in an Array

                Return: ~
                    Result of the function call

nvim_chan_send({chan}, {data})                              *nvim_chan_send()*
                Send data to channel `id` . For a job, it writes it to the
                stdin of the process. For the stdio channel |channel-stdio|,
                it writes to Nvim's stdout. For an internal terminal instance
                (|nvim_open_term()|) it writes directly to terimal output. See
                |channel-bytes| for more information.

                This function writes raw data, not RPC messages. If the
                channel was created with `rpc=true` then the channel expects
                RPC messages, use |vim.rpcnotify()| and |vim.rpcrequest()|
                instead.

                Parameters: ~
                    {chan}  id of the channel
                    {data}  data to write. 8-bit clean: can contain NUL bytes.

nvim_command({command})                                       *nvim_command()*
                Executes an ex-command.

                On execution error: fails with VimL error, does not update
                v:errmsg.

                Parameters: ~
                    {command}  Ex-command string

                See also: ~
                    |nvim_exec()|

nvim_create_buf({listed}, {scratch})                       *nvim_create_buf()*
                Creates a new, empty, unnamed buffer.

                Parameters: ~
                    {listed}   Sets 'buflisted'
                    {scratch}  Creates a "throwaway" |scratch-buffer| for
                               temporary work (always 'nomodified'). Also sets
                               'nomodeline' on the buffer.

                Return: ~
                    Buffer handle, or 0 on error

                See also: ~
                    buf_open_scratch

nvim_create_namespace({name})                        *nvim_create_namespace()*
                Creates a new namespace, or gets an existing one.

                Namespaces are used for buffer highlights and virtual text,
                see |nvim_buf_add_highlight()| and |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|.

                Namespaces can be named or anonymous. If `name` matches an
                existing namespace, the associated id is returned. If `name`
                is an empty string a new, anonymous namespace is created.

                Parameters: ~
                    {name}  Namespace name or empty string

                Return: ~

                Unmaps a global |mapping| for the given mode.

                To unmap a buffer-local mapping, use |nvim_buf_del_keymap()|.

                See also: ~
                    |nvim_set_keymap()|

                anonymous |:source|.

                Unlike |nvim_command()| this function supports heredocs,
                script-scope (s:), etc.

                On execution error: fails with VimL error, does not update
                v:errmsg.

nvim_exec_lua({code}, {args})                                *nvim_exec_lua()*
                Execute Lua code. Parameters (if any) are available as `...`
                inside the chunk. The chunk can return a value.

                Only statements are executed. To evaluate an expression,
                prefix it with `return` : return my_function(...)

                Parameters: ~
                    {code}  Lua code to execute
                    {args}  Arguments to the code

                Sends input-keys to Nvim, subject to various quirks controlled
                by `mode` flags. This is a blocking call, unlike
                |nvim_input()|.

                On execution error: does not fail, but updates v:errmsg.

                To input sequences like <C-o> use |nvim_replace_termcodes()|
                (typically with escape_csi=true) to replace the keycodes. Then
                pass the result to nvim_feedkeys().

                Example: >
                    :let key = nvim_replace_termcodes("<C-o>", v:true, v:false, v:true)
                    :call nvim_feedkeys(key, 'n', v:true)
<

                Parameters: ~

                    • "stream" the stream underlying the channel
                      • "stdio" stdin and stdout of this Nvim instance
                      • "stderr" stderr of this Nvim instance
                      • "socket" TCP/IP socket or named pipe

                    • "pty" Name of pseudoterminal, if one is used (optional).
                      On a POSIX system, this will be a device path like
                      /dev/pts/1. Even if the name is unknown, the key will
                      still be present to indicate a pty is used. This is
                      currently the case when using winpty on windows.
                    • "buffer" buffer with connected |terminal| instance

                    Option Information

nvim_get_proc({pid})                                         *nvim_get_proc()*

nvim_get_runtime_file({name}, {all})                 *nvim_get_runtime_file()*
                Find files in runtime directories

                'name' can contain wildcards. For example
                nvim_get_runtime_file("colors/*.vim", true) will return all
                color scheme files. Always use forward slashes (/) in the
                search pattern for subdirectories regardless of platform.

                It is not an error to not find any files. An empty array is
                returned then.

                To find a directory, `name` must end with a forward slash,
                like "rplugin/python/". Without the slash it would instead
                look for an ordinary file called "rplugin/python".

                Attributes: ~
                    {fast}

                Parameters: ~
                    {name}  pattern of files to search for
                    {all}   whether to return all matches or only the first

                Return: ~
                    list of absolute paths to the found files

nvim_get_var({name})                                          *nvim_get_var()*
                Gets a global (g:) variable.

                Parameters: ~
                    {name}  Variable name

                Return: ~
                    Variable value

nvim_get_vvar({name})                                        *nvim_get_vvar()*
                Gets a v: variable.

                Parameters: ~
                    {name}  Variable name

                Return: ~
                    Variable value

nvim_input({keys})                                              *nvim_input()*
                Queues raw user-input. Unlike |nvim_feedkeys()|, this uses a
                low-level input buffer and the call is non-blocking (input is
                processed asynchronously by the eventloop).

                On execution error: does not fail, but updates v:errmsg.

                Note:
                    |keycodes| like <CR> are translated, so "<" is special. To
                    input a literal "<", send <LT>.

                Note:
                    For mouse events use |nvim_input_mouse()|. The pseudokey
                    form "<LeftMouse><col,row>" is deprecated since
                    |api-level| 6.

                Attributes: ~
                    {fast}

                Parameters: ~
                    {keys}  to be typed

                Return: ~
                    Number of bytes actually written (can be fewer than
                    requested if the buffer becomes full).

                                                          *nvim_input_mouse()*
nvim_input_mouse({button}, {action}, {modifier}, {grid}, {row}, {col})
                Send mouse event from GUI.

                Non-blocking: does not wait on any result, but queues the
                event to be processed soon by the event loop.

                Note:
                    Currently this doesn't support "scripting" multiple mouse
                    events by calling it multiple times in a loop: the
                    intermediate mouse positions will be ignored. It should be
                    used to implement real-time mouse input in a GUI. The
                    deprecated pseudokey form ("<LeftMouse><col,row>") of
                    |nvim_input()| has the same limitation.

                                "release". For the wheel, one of "up", "down",
                                "left", "right".
                    {modifier}  String of modifiers each represented by a
                                single char. The same specifiers are used as
                                for a key press, except that the "-" separator
                                is optional, so "C-A-", "c-a" and "CA" can all
                                be used to specify Ctrl+Alt+click.
                    {grid}      Grid number if the client uses |ui-multigrid|,

                Sets the current editor state from the given |context| map.

                Parameters: ~
                    {dict}  |Context| map.

nvim_notify({msg}, {log_level}, {opts})                        *nvim_notify()*
                Notify the user with a message

                Relays the call to vim.notify . By default forwards your
                message in the echo area but can be overridden to trigger

nvim_open_term({buffer}, {opts})                            *nvim_open_term()*
                Open a terminal instance in a buffer

                By default (and currently the only option) the terminal will
                not be connected to an external process. Instead, input send
                on the channel will be echoed directly by the terminal. This
                is useful to display ANSI terminal sequences returned as part
                of a rpc message, or similar.

                Note: to directly initiate the terminal using the right size,
                display the buffer in a configured window before calling this.
                For instance, for a floating display, first create an empty
                buffer using |nvim_create_buf()|, then display it using
                |nvim_open_win()|, and then call this function. Then
                |nvim_chan_send()| cal be called immediately to process
                sequences in a virtual terminal having the intended size.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  the buffer to use (expected to be empty)
                    {opts}    Optional parameters. Reserved for future use.

                Return: ~
                    Channel id, or 0 on error

nvim_open_win({buffer}, {enter}, {config})                   *nvim_open_win()*
                Open a new window.

                Currently this is used to open floating and external windows.
                Floats are windows that are drawn above the split layout, at
                some anchor position in some other window. Floats can be drawn
                internally or by external GUI with the |ui-multigrid|
                extension. External windows are only supported with multigrid
                GUIs, and are displayed as separate top-level windows.

                For a general overview of floats, see |api-floatwin|.

                Exactly one of `external` and `relative` must be specified.
                The `width` and `height` of the new window must be specified.

                With relative=editor (row=0,col=0) refers to the top-left
                corner of the screen-grid and (row=Lines-1,col=Columns-1)
                refers to the bottom-right corner. Fractional values are
                allowed, but the builtin implementation (used by non-multigrid
                UIs) will always round down to nearest integer.

                Out-of-bounds values, and configurations that make the float
                not fit inside the main editor, are allowed. The builtin
                implementation truncates values so floats are fully within the
                main screen grid. External GUIs could let floats hover outside
                of the main window like a tooltip, but this should not be used
                to specify arbitrary WM screen positions.

                    not allowed when |textlock| is active

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer to display, or 0 for current buffer
                    {enter}   Enter the window (make it the current window)
                    {config}  Map defining the window configuration. Keys:
                              • `relative`: Sets the window layout to "floating", placed
                                at (row,col) coordinates relative to:
                                • "editor" The global editor grid
                                • "win" Window given by the `win` field, or
                                  current window.
                                • "cursor" Cursor position in current window.

                              • `win` : |window-ID| for relative="win".
                              • `anchor`: Decides which corner of the float to place
                                at (row,col):
                                • "NW" northwest (default)
                                • "NE" northeast
                                • "SW" southwest
                                • "SE" southeast

                              • `width` : Window width (in character cells).
                                Minimum of 1.
                              • `height` : Window height (in character cells).
                                Minimum of 1.
                              • `bufpos` : Places float relative to buffer
                                text (only when relative="win"). Takes a tuple
                                of zero-indexed [line, column]. `row` and
                                `col` if given are applied relative to this
                                position, else they default to `row=1` and
                                `col=0` (thus like a tooltip near the buffer
                                text).
                              • `row` : Row position in units of "screen cell
                                height", may be fractional.
                              • `col` : Column position in units of "screen
                                cell width", may be fractional.
                              • `focusable` : Enable focus by user actions
                                (wincmds, mouse events). Defaults to true.
                                Non-focusable windows can be entered by
                                |nvim_set_current_win()|.
                              • `external` : GUI should display the window as
                                an external top-level window. Currently
                                accepts no other positioning configuration
                                together with this.
                              • `zindex`: Stacking order. floats with higher`zindex`go on top on floats with lower indices. Must
                                be larger than zero. The following screen
                                elements have hard-coded z-indices:
                                • 100: insert completion popupmenu
                                • 200: message scrollback
                                • 250: cmdline completion popupmenu (when
                                  wildoptions+=pum) The default value for
                                  floats are 50. In general, values below 100
                                  are recommended, unless there is a good
                                  reason to overshadow builtin elements.

                              • `style`: Configure the appearance of the window.
                                Currently only takes one non-empty value:
                                • "minimal" Nvim will display the window with
                                  many UI options disabled. This is useful
                                  when displaying a temporary float where the
                                  text should not be edited. Disables
                                  'number', 'relativenumber', 'cursorline',
                                  'cursorcolumn', 'foldcolumn', 'spell' and
                                  'list' options. 'signcolumn' is changed to
                                  `auto` and 'colorcolumn' is cleared. The
                                  end-of-buffer region is hidden by setting
                                  `eob` flag of 'fillchars' to a space char,
                                  and clearing the |EndOfBuffer| region in
                                  'winhighlight'.

                              • `border`: Style of (optional) window border. This can
                                either be a string or an array. The string
                                values are
                                • "none": No border (default).
                                • "single": A single line box.
                                • "double": A double line box.
                                • "rounded": Like "single", but with rounded
                                  corners ("╭" etc.).
                                • "solid": Adds padding by a single whitespace
                                  cell.
                                • "shadow": A drop shadow effect by blending
                                  with the background.
                                • If it is an array, it should have a length
                                  of eight or any divisor of eight. The array
                                  will specifify the eight chars building up
                                  the border in a clockwise fashion starting
                                  with the top-left corner. As an example, the
                                  double box style could be specified as [
                                  "╔", "═" ,"╗", "║", "╝", "═", "╚", "║" ]. If
                                  the number of chars are less than eight,
                                  they will be repeated. Thus an ASCII border
                                  could be specified as [ "/", "-", "\\", "|"
                                  ], or all chars the same as [ "x" ]. An
                                  empty string can be used to turn off a
                                  specific border, for instance, [ "", "", "",
                                  ">", "", "", "", "<" ] will only make
                                  vertical borders but not horizontal ones. By
                                  default, `FloatBorder` highlight is used,
                                  which links to `VertSplit` when not defined.
                                  It could also be specified by character: [
                                  {"+", "MyCorner"}, {"x", "MyBorder"} ].

                              • `noautocmd` : If true then no buffer-related
                                autocommand events such as |BufEnter|,
                                |BufLeave| or |BufWinEnter| may fire from
                                calling this function.

nvim_paste({data}, {crlf}, {phase})                             *nvim_paste()*
                Pastes at cursor, in any mode.

                Invokes the `vim.paste` handler, which handles each mode
                appropriately. Sets redo/undo. Faster than |nvim_input()|.
                Lines break at LF ("\n").

                Errors ('nomodifiable', `vim.paste()` failure, …) are
                reflected in `err` but do not affect the return value (which
                is strictly decided by `vim.paste()` ). On error, subsequent
                calls are ignored ("drained") until the next paste is
                initiated (phase 1 or -1).

                Attributes: ~
                    not allowed when |textlock| is active

                Parameters: ~
                    {data}   Multiline input. May be binary (containing NUL
                             bytes).
                    {crlf}   Also break lines at CR and CRLF.
                    {phase}  -1: paste in a single call (i.e. without
                             streaming). To "stream" a paste, call `nvim_paste` sequentially with these `phase` values:
                             • 1: starts the paste (exactly once)
                             • 2: continues the paste (zero or more times)
                             • 3: ends the paste (exactly once)

                Return: ~

                    • true: Client may continue pasting.
                    • false: Client must cancel the paste.

                              • "b" |blockwise-visual| mode (may include
                                width, e.g. "b3")
                              • "c" |charwise| mode
                              • "l" |linewise| mode
                              • "" guess by contents, see |setreg()|
                    {after}   If true insert after cursor (like |p|), or

                                                    *nvim_replace_termcodes()*
nvim_replace_termcodes({str}, {from_part}, {do_lt}, {special})
                Replaces terminal codes and |keycodes| (<CR>, <Esc>, ...) in a
                string with the internal representation.

                Parameters: ~
                    {str}        String to be converted.
                    {from_part}  Legacy Vim parameter. Usually true.
                    {do_lt}      Also translate <lt>. Ignored if `special` is
                                 false.
                    {special}    Replace |keycodes|, e.g. <CR> becomes a "\n"
                                 char.

                                                *nvim_select_popupmenu_item()*
nvim_select_popupmenu_item({item}, {insert}, {finish}, {opts})
                Selects an item in the completion popupmenu.

                If |ins-completion| is not active this API call is silently
                ignored. Useful for an external UI using |ui-popupmenu| to
                control the popupmenu with the mouse. Can also be used in a
                mapping; use <cmd> |:map-cmd| to ensure the mapping doesn't
                end completion mode.

                Parameters: ~
                    {item}    Index (zero-based) of the item to select. Value
                              of -1 selects nothing and restores the original
                              text.
                    {insert}  Whether the selection should be inserted in the
                              buffer.
                    {finish}  Finish the completion and dismiss the popupmenu.
                              Implies `insert` .
                    {opts}    Optional parameters. Reserved for future use.

                                                      *nvim_set_client_info()*
nvim_set_client_info({name}, {version}, {type}, {methods}, {attributes})
                Self-identifies the client.

                The client/plugin/application should call this after
                connecting, to provide hints about its identity and purpose,
                for debugging and orchestration.

                Can be called more than once; the caller should merge old info
                if appropriate. Example: library first identifies the channel,
                then a plugin using that library later identifies itself.

                Note:
                    "Something is better than nothing". You don't need to
                    include all the fields.

                                  • "patch" patch number
                                  • "prerelease" string describing a
                                    prerelease, like "dev" or "beta1"
                                  • "commit" hash or similar identifier of
                                    commit
                    {type}        Must be one of the following values. Client
                                  libraries should default to "remote" unless
                                  overridden by the user.

                                  will be discovered later. The key should be
                                  the method name, the values are dicts with
                                  these (optional) keys (more keys may be
                                  added in future versions of Nvim, thus
                                  unknown keys are ignored. Clients must only
                                  use keys defined in this or later versions
                                  of Nvim):
                                  • "async" if true, send as a notification.
                                    If false or unspecified, use a blocking

                                              *nvim_set_decoration_provider()*
nvim_set_decoration_provider({ns_id}, {opts})
                Set or change decoration provider for a namespace

                This is a very general purpose interface for having lua
                callbacks being triggered during the redraw code.

                The expected usage is to set extmarks for the currently
                redrawn buffer. |nvim_buf_set_extmark| can be called to add
                marks on a per-window or per-lines basis. Use the `ephemeral`
                key to only use the mark for the current screen redraw (the
                callback will be called again for the next redraw ).

                Note: this function should not be called often. Rather, the
                callbacks themselves can be used to throttle unneeded
                callbacks. the `on_start` callback can return `false` to
                disable the provider until the next redraw. Similarly, return
                `false` in `on_win` will skip the `on_lines` calls for that
                window (but any extmarks set in `on_win` will still be used).
                A plugin managing multiple sources of decoration should
                ideally only set one provider, and merge the sources
                internally. You can use multiple `ns_id` for the extmarks
                set/modified inside the callback anyway.

                Note: doing anything other than setting extmarks is considered
                experimental. Doing things like changing options are not
                expliticly forbidden, but is likely to have unexpected
                consequences (such as 100% CPU consumption). doing
                `vim.rpcnotify` should be OK, but `vim.rpcrequest` is quite
                dubious for the moment.

                Parameters: ~
                    {ns_id}  Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()|
                    {opts}   Callbacks invoked during redraw:
                             • on_start: called first on each screen redraw
                               ["start", tick]
                             • on_buf: called for each buffer being redrawn
                               (before window callbacks) ["buf", bufnr, tick]
                             • on_win: called when starting to redraw a
                               specific window. ["win", winid, bufnr, topline,
                               botline_guess]
                             • on_line: called for each buffer line being
                               redrawn. (The interation with fold lines is
                               subject to change) ["win", winid, bufnr, row]
                             • on_end: called at the end of a redraw cycle
                               ["end", tick]

nvim_set_hl({ns_id}, {name}, {val})                            *nvim_set_hl()*
                Set a highlight group.

                TODO: ns_id = 0, should modify :highlight namespace TODO val
                should take update vs reset flag

                Parameters: ~
                    {ns_id}  number of namespace for this highlight
                    {name}   highlight group name, like ErrorMsg
                    {val}    highlight definition map, like
                             |nvim_get_hl_by_name|. in addition the following
                             keys are also recognized: `default` : don't
                             override existing definition, like `hi default`
                             `ctermfg` : sets foreground of cterm color
                             `ctermbg` : sets background of cterm color
                             `cterm` : cterm attribute map. sets attributed
                             for cterm colors. similer to `hi cterm` Note: by
                             default cterm attributes are same as attributes
                             of gui color

nvim_set_keymap({mode}, {lhs}, {rhs}, {opts})              *nvim_set_keymap()*
                Sets a global |mapping| for the given mode.

                To set a buffer-local mapping, use |nvim_buf_set_keymap()|.

                Unlike |:map|, leading/trailing whitespace is accepted as part
                of the {lhs} or {rhs}. Empty {rhs} is |<Nop>|. |keycodes| are
                replaced as usual.

                Example: >
                    call nvim_set_keymap('n', ' <NL>', '', {'nowait': v:true})
<

                is equivalent to: >
                    nmap <nowait> <Space><NL> <Nop>
<

                Parameters: ~
                    {mode}  Mode short-name (map command prefix: "n", "i",

                            for |:map|.
                    {lhs}   Left-hand-side |{lhs}| of the mapping.

Buffer Functions                                                  *api-buffer*


For more information on buffers, see |buffers|.

Unloaded Buffers:~

Buffers may be unloaded by the |:bunload| command or the
buffer's |'bufhidden'| option. When a buffer is unloaded its
file contents are freed from memory and vim cannot operate on
the buffer lines until it is reloaded (usually by opening the
buffer again in a new window). API methods such as
|nvim_buf_get_lines()| and |nvim_buf_line_count()| will be
affected.

You can use |nvim_buf_is_loaded()| or |nvim_buf_line_count()|
to check whether a buffer is loaded.

                                                    *nvim__buf_redraw_range()*
nvim__buf_redraw_range({buffer}, {first}, {last})
                TODO: Documentation

nvim__buf_stats({buffer})                                  *nvim__buf_stats()*
                TODO: Documentation

                                                    *nvim_buf_add_highlight()*
nvim_buf_add_highlight({buffer}, {ns_id}, {hl_group}, {line}, {col_start},
                       {col_end})
                Adds a highlight to buffer.

                Useful for plugins that dynamically generate highlights to a
                buffer (like a semantic highlighter or linter). The function
                adds a single highlight to a buffer. Unlike |matchaddpos()|
                highlights follow changes to line numbering (as lines are
                inserted/removed above the highlighted line), like signs and
                marks do.

                Namespaces are used for batch deletion/updating of a set of
                highlights. To create a namespace, use
                |nvim_create_namespace()| which returns a namespace id. Pass
                it in to this function as `ns_id` to add highlights to the
                namespace. All highlights in the same namespace can then be
                cleared with single call to |nvim_buf_clear_namespace()|. If
                the highlight never will be deleted by an API call, pass
                `ns_id = -1` .

                As a shorthand, `ns_id = 0` can be used to create a new
                namespace for the highlight, the allocated id is then
                returned. If `hl_group` is the empty string no highlight is
                added, but a new `ns_id` is still returned. This is supported
                for backwards compatibility, new code should use
                |nvim_create_namespace()| to create a new empty namespace.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}     Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {ns_id}      namespace to use or -1 for ungrouped
                                 highlight
                    {hl_group}   Name of the highlight group to use
                    {line}       Line to highlight (zero-indexed)
                    {col_start}  Start of (byte-indexed) column range to
                                 highlight
                    {col_end}    End of (byte-indexed) column range to
                                 highlight, or -1 to highlight to end of line

                Return: ~
                    The ns_id that was used

nvim_buf_attach({buffer}, {send_buffer}, {opts})           *nvim_buf_attach()*
                Activates buffer-update events on a channel, or as Lua
                callbacks.

                Example (Lua): capture buffer updates in a global `events` variable (use "print(vim.inspect(events))" to see its
                contents): >
                  events = {}
                  vim.api.nvim_buf_attach(0, false, {

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {opts}    Optional parameters. Currently not used.

                Return: ~
                    Map of maps describing commands.

                                                *nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id()*
nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id({buffer}, {ns_id}, {id}, {opts})
                Gets the position (0-indexed) of an extmark {id}.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {ns_id}   Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()|
                    {id}      Extmark id
                    {opts}    Optional parameters. Keys:
                              • details: Whether to include the details dict

                Return: ~
                    0-indexed (row, col) tuple or empty list () if extmark id
                    was absent

                                                     *nvim_buf_get_extmarks()*
nvim_buf_get_extmarks({buffer}, {ns_id}, {start}, {end}, {opts})
                Gets extmarks in "traversal order" from a |charwise| region
                defined by buffer positions (inclusive, 0-indexed
                |api-indexing|).

                Region can be given as (row,col) tuples, or valid extmark ids
                (whose positions define the bounds). 0 and -1 are understood
                as (0,0) and (-1,-1) respectively, thus the following are
                equivalent:
>
    nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, my_ns, 0, -1, {})
    nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, my_ns, [0,0], [-1,-1], {})
<

                If `end` is less than `start` , traversal works backwards.
                (Useful with `limit` , to get the first marks prior to a given
                position.)

                Example:
>
    local a   = vim.api
    local pos = a.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
    local ns  = a.nvim_create_namespace('my-plugin')
    -- Create new extmark at line 1, column 1.
    local m1  = a.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns, 0, 0, 0, {})
    -- Create new extmark at line 3, column 1.
    local m2  = a.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns, 0, 2, 0, {})
    -- Get extmarks only from line 3.
    local ms  = a.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, ns, {2,0}, {2,0}, {})
    -- Get all marks in this buffer + namespace.
    local all = a.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, ns, 0, -1, {})
    print(vim.inspect(ms))
<

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {ns_id}   Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()|
                    {start}   Start of range, given as 0-indexed (row, col) or
                              valid extmark id (whose position defines the
                              bound)
                    {end}     End of range (inclusive), given as 0-indexed
                              (row, col) or valid extmark id (whose position
                              defines the bound)
                    {opts}    Optional parameters. Keys:
                              • limit: Maximum number of marks to return
                              • details Whether to include the details dict

                Return: ~
                    List of [extmark_id, row, col] tuples in "traversal
                    order".

nvim_buf_get_keymap({buffer}, {mode})                  *nvim_buf_get_keymap()*
                Gets a list of buffer-local |mapping| definitions.

                Parameters: ~
                    {mode}    Mode short-name ("n", "i", "v", ...)
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

                Return: ~
                    Array of maparg()-like dictionaries describing mappings.
                    The "buffer" key holds the associated buffer handle.

                                                        *nvim_buf_get_lines()*
nvim_buf_get_lines({buffer}, {start}, {end}, {strict_indexing})
                Gets a line-range from the buffer.

                Indexing is zero-based, end-exclusive. Negative indices are
                interpreted as length+1+index: -1 refers to the index past the
                end. So to get the last element use start=-2 and end=-1.

                Out-of-bounds indices are clamped to the nearest valid value,
                unless `strict_indexing` is set.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}           Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {start}            First line index
                    {end}              Last line index (exclusive)
                    {strict_indexing}  Whether out-of-bounds should be an
                                       error.

                Return: ~
                    Array of lines, or empty array for unloaded buffer.

nvim_buf_get_mark({buffer}, {name})                      *nvim_buf_get_mark()*
                Return a tuple (row,col) representing the position of the
                named mark.

                Marks are (1,0)-indexed. |api-indexing|

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {name}    Mark name

                Return: ~
                    (row, col) tuple

nvim_buf_get_name({buffer})                              *nvim_buf_get_name()*
                Gets the full file name for the buffer

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

                Return: ~
                    Buffer name

nvim_buf_get_offset({buffer}, {index})                 *nvim_buf_get_offset()*
                Returns the byte offset of a line (0-indexed). |api-indexing|

                Line 1 (index=0) has offset 0. UTF-8 bytes are counted. EOL is
                one byte. 'fileformat' and 'fileencoding' are ignored. The
                line index just after the last line gives the total byte-count
                of the buffer. A final EOL byte is counted if it would be
                written, see 'eol'.

                Unlike |line2byte()|, throws error for out-of-bounds indexing.
                Returns -1 for unloaded buffer.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {index}   Line index

                Return: ~
                    Integer byte offset, or -1 for unloaded buffer.

nvim_buf_get_option({buffer}, {name})                  *nvim_buf_get_option()*
                Gets a buffer option value

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {name}    Option name

                Return: ~
                    Option value

nvim_buf_get_var({buffer}, {name})                        *nvim_buf_get_var()*
                Gets a buffer-scoped (b:) variable.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {name}    Variable name

                Return: ~
                    Variable value

nvim_buf_is_loaded({buffer})                            *nvim_buf_is_loaded()*
                Checks if a buffer is valid and loaded. See |api-buffer| for
                more info about unloaded buffers.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

                Return: ~
                    true if the buffer is valid and loaded, false otherwise.

nvim_buf_is_valid({buffer})                              *nvim_buf_is_valid()*
                Checks if a buffer is valid.

                Note:
                    Even if a buffer is valid it may have been unloaded. See
                    |api-buffer| for more info about unloaded buffers.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

                Return: ~
                    true if the buffer is valid, false otherwise.

nvim_buf_line_count({buffer})                          *nvim_buf_line_count()*
                Gets the buffer line count

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

                Return: ~
                    Line count, or 0 for unloaded buffer. |api-buffer|

                                                      *nvim_buf_set_extmark()*
nvim_buf_set_extmark({buffer}, {ns_id}, {line}, {col}, {opts})
                Creates or updates an extmark.

                To create a new extmark, pass id=0. The extmark id will be
                returned. To move an existing mark, pass its id.

                It is also allowed to create a new mark by passing in a
                previously unused id, but the caller must then keep track of
                existing and unused ids itself. (Useful over RPC, to avoid
                waiting for the return value.)

                Using the optional arguments, it is possible to use this to
                highlight a range of text, and also to associate virtual text
                to the mark.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {ns_id}   Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()|
                    {line}    Line where to place the mark, 0-based
                    {col}     Column where to place the mark, 0-based
                    {opts}    Optional parameters.
                              • id : id of the extmark to edit.
                              • end_line : ending line of the mark, 0-based
                                inclusive.
                              • end_col : ending col of the mark, 0-based
                                exclusive.
                              • hl_group : name of the highlight group used to
                                highlight this mark.
                              • virt_text : virtual text to link to this mark.
                                A list of [text, highlight] tuples, each
                                representing a text chunk with specified
                                highlight. `highlight` element can either be a
                                a single highlight group, or an array of
                                multiple highlight groups that will be stacked
                                (highest priority last). A highlight group can
                                be supplied either as a string or as an
                                integer, the latter which can be obtained
                                using |nvim_get_hl_id_by_name|.
                              • virt_text_pos : position of virtual text.
                                Possible values:

                                  column, without shifting the underlying
                                  text.
                                • "right_align": display right aligned in the
                                  window.

                              • virt_text_win_col : position the virtual text
                                at a fixed window column (starting from the
                                first text column)
                              • virt_text_hide : hide the virtual text when
                                the background text is selected or hidden due
                                to horizontal scroll 'nowrap'
                              • hl_mode : control how highlights are combined
                                with the highlights of the text. Currently
                                only affects virt_text highlights, but might
                                affect`hl_group`in later versions.
                                • "replace": only show the virt_text color.
                                  This is the default
                                • "combine": combine with background text
                                  color
                                • "blend": blend with background text color.

                              • hl_eol : when true, for a multiline highlight
                                covering the EOL of a line, continue the
                                highlight for the rest of the screen line
                                (just like for diff and cursorline highlight).
                              • ephemeral : for use with
                                |nvim_set_decoration_provider| callbacks. The
                                mark will only be used for the current redraw
                                cycle, and not be permantently stored in the
                                buffer.
                              • right_gravity : boolean that indicates the
                                direction the extmark will be shifted in when
                                new text is inserted (true for right, false
                                for left). defaults to true.
                              • end_right_gravity : boolean that indicates the
                                direction the extmark end position (if it
                                exists) will be shifted in when new text is
                                inserted (true for right, false for left).
                                Defaults to false.
                              • priority: a priority value for the highlight
                                group. For example treesitter highlighting
                                uses a value of 100.

                Return: ~
                    Id of the created/updated extmark

                                                       *nvim_buf_set_keymap()*
nvim_buf_set_keymap({buffer}, {mode}, {lhs}, {rhs}, {opts})
                Sets a buffer-local |mapping| for the given mode.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

nvim_buf_set_lines({buffer}, {start}, {end}, {strict_indexing}, {replacement})
                Sets (replaces) a line-range in the buffer.

                Indexing is zero-based, end-exclusive. Negative indices are
                interpreted as length+1+index: -1 refers to the index past the
                end. So to change or delete the last element use start=-2 and
                end=-1.

                To insert lines at a given index, set `start` and `end` to the
                same index. To delete a range of lines, set `replacement` to
                an empty array.

                Out-of-bounds indices are clamped to the nearest valid value,
                unless `strict_indexing` is set.

                Attributes: ~
                    not allowed when |textlock| is active

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}           Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {start}            First line index
                    {end}              Last line index (exclusive)
                    {strict_indexing}  Whether out-of-bounds should be an
                                       error.
                    {replacement}      Array of lines to use as replacement

nvim_buf_set_name({buffer}, {name})                      *nvim_buf_set_name()*
                Sets the full file name for a buffer

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {name}    Buffer name

nvim_buf_set_option({buffer}, {name}, {value})         *nvim_buf_set_option()*
                Sets a buffer option value. Passing 'nil' as value deletes the
                option (only works if there's a global fallback)

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {name}    Option name
                    {value}   Option value

                                                         *nvim_buf_set_text()*
nvim_buf_set_text({buffer}, {start_row}, {start_col}, {end_row}, {end_col},
                  {replacement})
                Sets (replaces) a range in the buffer

                This is recommended over nvim_buf_set_lines when only
                modifying parts of a line, as extmarks will be preserved on
                non-modified parts of the touched lines.

                Indexing is zero-based and end-exclusive.

                To insert text at a given index, set `start` and `end` ranges
                to the same index. To delete a range, set `replacement` to an
                array containing an empty string, or simply an empty array.

                Prefer nvim_buf_set_lines when adding or deleting entire lines
                only.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}        Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
                    {start_row}     First line index
                    {start_column}  Last column
                    {end_row}       Last line index
                    {end_column}    Last column
                    {replacement}   Array of lines to use as replacement

nvim_buf_set_var({buffer}, {name}, {value})               *nvim_buf_set_var()*
                Sets a buffer-scoped (b:) variable

                Parameters: ~

                    If multiple UI clients are attached, the global screen
                    dimensions degrade to the smallest client. E.g. if client
                    A requests 80x40 but client B requests 200x100, the global
                    screen has size 80x40.

                Parameters: ~
                    {width}    Requested screen columns
                    {height}   Requested screen rows
                    {options}  |ui-option| map

nvim_ui_detach()                                            *nvim_ui_detach()*
                Deactivates UI events on the channel.

                Removes the client from the list of UIs. |nvim_list_uis()|

                                                    *nvim_ui_pum_set_bounds()*
nvim_ui_pum_set_bounds({width}, {height}, {row}, {col})
                Tells Nvim the geometry of the popumenu, to align floating
                windows with an external popup menu.

                Note that this method is not to be confused with
                |nvim_ui_pum_set_height()|, which sets the number of visible
                items in the popup menu, while this function sets the bounding
                box of the popup menu, including visual elements such as
                borders and sliders. Floats need not use the same font size,
                nor be anchored to exact grid corners, so one can set
                floating-point numbers to the popup menu geometry.

                Parameters: ~
                    {width}   Popupmenu width.
                    {height}  Popupmenu height.
                    {row}     Popupmenu row.
                    {col}     Popupmenu height.

nvim_ui_pum_set_height({height})                    *nvim_ui_pum_set_height()*
                Tells Nvim the number of elements displaying in the popumenu,
                to decide <PageUp> and <PageDown> movement.

                Parameters: ~
                    {height}  Popupmenu height, must be greater than zero.

nvim_ui_try_resize({width}, {height})                   *nvim_ui_try_resize()*
                TODO: Documentation

                                                   *nvim_ui_try_resize_grid()*
nvim_ui_try_resize_grid({grid}, {width}, {height})
                Tell Nvim to resize a grid. Triggers a grid_resize event with
                the requested grid size or the maximum size if it exceeds size
                limits.

                On invalid grid handle, fails with error.

                Parameters: ~
                    {grid}    The handle of the grid to be changed.
                    {width}   The new requested width.
                    {height}  The new requested height.
