Nvim API                                                           *API* *api*

Nvim exposes a powerful API that can be used by plugins and external processes
via |RPC|, |Lua| and Vimscript (|eval-api|).

Applications can also embed libnvim to work with the C API directly.

==============================================================================
API Usage                                               *api-rpc* *RPC* *rpc*

                                                        *msgpack-rpc*
RPC is the main way to control Nvim programmatically.  Nvim implements the
MessagePack-RPC protocol with these extra (out-of-spec) constraints:

1. Responses must be given in reverse order of requests (like "unwinding
   a stack").
2. Nvim processes all messages (requests and notifications) in the order they
   are received.

MessagePack-RPC specification:
  https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc/blob/master/spec.md
  https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/0b8f5ac/spec.md

Many clients use the API: user interfaces (GUIs), remote plugins, scripts like
"nvr" (https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote).  Even Nvim itself can control
other Nvim instances.  API clients can:

  - Call any API function
  - Listen for events
  - Receive remote calls from Nvim

The RPC API is like a more powerful version of Vim's "clientserver" feature.

CONNECTING                                              *rpc-connecting*

See |channel-intro| for various ways to open a channel. Channel-opening
functions take an `rpc` key in the options dictionary. RPC channels can also
be opened by other processes connecting to TCP/IP sockets or named pipes
listened to by Nvim.

Nvim creates a default RPC socket at |startup|, given by |v:servername|. To
start with a TCP/IP socket instead, use |--listen| with a TCP-style address: >
    nvim --listen 127.0.0.1:6666
More endpoints can be started with |serverstart()|.

Note that localhost TCP sockets are generally less secure than named pipes,
and can lead to vulnerabilities like remote code execution.

Connecting to the socket is the easiest way a programmer can test the API,
which can be done through any msgpack-rpc client library or full-featured
|api-client|. Here's a Ruby script that prints "hello world!" in the current
Nvim instance:
>ruby
    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    # Requires msgpack-rpc: gem install msgpack-rpc
    #
    # To run this script, execute it from a running Nvim instance (notice the
    # trailing '&' which is required since Nvim won't process events while
    # running a blocking command):
    #
    #   :!./hello.rb &
    #
    # Or from another shell by setting NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS:
    # $ NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS=[address] ./hello.rb

    require 'msgpack/rpc'
    require 'msgpack/rpc/transport/unix'

    nvim = MessagePack::RPC::Client.new(MessagePack::RPC::UNIXTransport.new, ENV['NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS'])
    result = nvim.call(:nvim_command, 'echo "hello world!"')
<
A better way is to use the Python REPL with the "pynvim" package, where API
functions can be called interactively:
>
    >>> from pynvim import attach
    >>> nvim = attach('socket', path='[address]')
    >>> nvim.command('echo "hello world!"')
<
You can also embed Nvim via |jobstart()|, and communicate using |rpcrequest()|
and |rpcnotify()|:
>vim
    let nvim = jobstart(['nvim', '--embed'], {'rpc': v:true})
    echo rpcrequest(nvim, 'nvim_eval', '"Hello " . "world!"')
    call jobstop(nvim)
<

==============================================================================
API Definitions                                         *api-definitions*

                                                        *api-types*
The Nvim C API defines custom types for all function parameters. Some are just
typedefs around C99 standard types, others are Nvim-defined data structures.

Basic types ~
>
  API Type                              C type
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Nil
  Boolean                               bool
  Integer (signed 64-bit integer)       int64_t
  Float (IEEE 754 double precision)     double
  String                                {char* data, size_t size} struct
  Array
  Dictionary (msgpack: map)
  Object
<
  Note:
    - Empty Array is accepted as a valid Dictionary parameter.
    - Functions cannot cross RPC boundaries. But API functions (e.g.
      |nvim_create_autocmd()|) may support Lua function parameters for non-RPC
      invocations.

Special types (msgpack EXT) ~

  These are integer typedefs discriminated as separate Object subtypes. They
  can be treated as opaque integers, but are mutually incompatible: Buffer may
  be passed as an integer but not as Window or Tabpage.

  The EXT object data is the (integer) object handle. The EXT type codes given
  in the |api-metadata| `types` key are stable: they will not change and are
  thus forward-compatible.
>
  EXT Type      C type                                  Data
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Buffer        enum value kObjectTypeBuffer            |bufnr()|
  Window        enum value kObjectTypeWindow            |window-ID|
  Tabpage       enum value kObjectTypeTabpage           internal handle
<

                                                        *api-indexing*
Most of the API uses 0-based indices, and ranges are end-exclusive. For the
end of a range, -1 denotes the last line/column.

Exception: the following API functions use "mark-like" indexing (1-based
lines, 0-based columns):

- |nvim_get_mark()|
- |nvim_buf_get_mark()|
- |nvim_buf_set_mark()|
- |nvim_win_get_cursor()|
- |nvim_win_set_cursor()|

Exception: the following API functions use |extmarks| indexing (0-based
indices, end-inclusive):

- |nvim_buf_del_extmark()|
- |nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id()|
- |nvim_buf_get_extmarks()|
- |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|

                                                        *api-fast*
Most API functions are "deferred": they are queued on the main loop and
processed sequentially with normal input.  So if the editor is waiting for
user input in a "modal" fashion (e.g. the |hit-enter-prompt|), the request
will block.  Non-deferred (fast) functions such as |nvim_get_mode()| and
|nvim_input()| are served immediately (i.e. without waiting in the input
queue).  Lua code can use |vim.in_fast_event()| to detect a fast context.

==============================================================================
API metadata                                            *api-metadata*

The Nvim C API is automatically exposed to RPC by the build system, which
parses headers in src/nvim/api/* and generates dispatch-functions mapping RPC
API method names to public C API functions, converting/validating arguments
and return values.

Nvim exposes its API metadata as a Dictionary with these items:

- version                 Nvim version, API level/compatibility
- version.api_level       API version integer *api-level*
- version.api_compatible  API is backwards-compatible with this level
- version.api_prerelease  Declares the API as unstable/unreleased
                          `(version.api_prerelease && fn.since == version.api_level)`
- functions               API function signatures, containing |api-types| info
                          describing the return value and parameters.
- ui_events               |UI| event signatures
- ui_options              Supported |ui-option|s
- {fn}.since              API level where function {fn} was introduced
- {fn}.deprecated_since   API level where function {fn} was deprecated
- types                   Custom handle types defined by Nvim
- error_types             Possible error types returned by API functions

About the `functions` map:

  - Container types may be decorated with type/size constraints, e.g.
    ArrayOf(Buffer) or ArrayOf(Integer, 2).
  - Functions considered to be methods that operate on instances of Nvim
    special types (msgpack EXT) have the "method=true" flag. The receiver type
    is that of the first argument. Method names are prefixed with `nvim_` plus
    a type name, e.g. `nvim_buf_get_lines` is the `get_lines` method of
    a Buffer instance. |dev-api|
  - Global functions have the "method=false" flag and are prefixed with just
    `nvim_`, e.g. `nvim_list_bufs`.

                                                        *api-mapping*
External programs (clients) can use the metadata to discover the API, using
any of these approaches:

  1. Connect to a running Nvim instance and call |nvim_get_api_info()| via
     msgpack-RPC. This is best for clients written in dynamic languages which
     can define functions at runtime.

  2. Start Nvim with |--api-info|. Useful for statically-compiled clients.
     Example (requires Python "pyyaml" and "msgpack-python" modules): >
     nvim --api-info | python -c 'import msgpack, sys, yaml; yaml.dump(msgpack.unpackb(sys.stdin.buffer.read()), sys.stdout)'
<
  3. Use the |api_info()| Vimscript function. >vim
     :lua vim.print(vim.fn.api_info())
<     Example using |filter()| to exclude non-deprecated API functions: >vim
     :new|put =map(filter(api_info().functions, '!has_key(v:val,''deprecated_since'')'), 'v:val.name')

==============================================================================
API contract                                                     *api-contract*

The Nvim API is composed of functions and events.

- Clients call functions like those described at |api-global|.
- Clients can subscribe to |ui-events|, |api-buffer-updates|, etc.
- API function names are prefixed with "nvim_".
- API event names are prefixed with "nvim_" and suffixed with "_event".

As Nvim evolves the API may change in compliance with this CONTRACT:

- New functions and events may be added.
  - Any such extensions are OPTIONAL: old clients may ignore them.
- Function signatures will NOT CHANGE (after release).
  - Functions introduced in the development (unreleased) version MAY CHANGE.
    (Clients can dynamically check `api_prerelease`, etc. |api-metadata|)
- Event parameters will not be removed or reordered (after release).
- Events may be EXTENDED: new parameters may be added.
- New items may be ADDED to map/list parameters/results of functions and
  events.
  - Any such new items are OPTIONAL: old clients may ignore them.
  - Existing items will not be removed (after release).
- Deprecated functions will not be removed until Nvim version 2.0

"Private" interfaces are NOT covered by this contract:

- Undocumented (not in :help) functions or events of any kind
- nvim__x ("double underscore") functions

The idea is "versionless evolution", in the words of Rich Hickey:
- Relaxing a requirement should be a compatible change.
- Strengthening a promise should be a compatible change.

==============================================================================
Global events                                               *api-global-events*

When a client invokes an API request as an async notification, it is not
possible for Nvim to send an error response. Instead, in case of error, the
following notification will be sent to the client:

                                                             *nvim_error_event*
nvim_error_event[{type}, {message}]

{type} is a numeric id as defined by `api_info().error_types`, and {message} is
a string with the error message.

==============================================================================
Buffer update events                                    *api-buffer-updates*

API clients can "attach" to Nvim buffers to subscribe to buffer update events.
This is similar to |TextChanged| but more powerful and granular.

Call |nvim_buf_attach()| to receive these events on the channel:

                                                        *nvim_buf_lines_event*
nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, {firstline}, {lastline}, {linedata}, {more}]

    When the buffer text between {firstline} and {lastline} (end-exclusive,
    zero-indexed) were changed to the new text in the {linedata} list. The
    granularity is a line, i.e. if a single character is changed in the
    editor, the entire line is sent.

    When {changedtick} is |v:null| this means the screen lines (display)
    changed but not the buffer contents. {linedata} contains the changed
    screen lines. This happens when 'inccommand' shows a buffer preview.

    Properties: ~
        {buf} API buffer handle (buffer number)

        {changedtick} value of |b:changedtick| for the buffer. If you send an
        API command back to nvim you can check the value of |b:changedtick| as
        part of your request to ensure that no other changes have been made.

        {firstline} integer line number of the first line that was replaced.
        Zero-indexed: if line 1 was replaced then {firstline} will be 0, not
        1. {firstline} is always less than or equal to the number of lines
        that were in the buffer before the lines were replaced.

        {lastline} integer line number of the first line that was not replaced
        (i.e. the range {firstline}, {lastline} is end-exclusive).
        Zero-indexed: if line numbers 2 to 5 were replaced, this will be 5
        instead of 6. {lastline} is always be less than or equal to the number
        of lines that were in the buffer before the lines were replaced.
        {lastline} will be -1 if the event is part of the initial update after
        attaching.

        {linedata} list of strings containing the contents of the new buffer
        lines. Newline characters are omitted; empty lines are sent as empty
        strings.

        {more} boolean, true for a "multipart" change notification: the
        current change was chunked into multiple |nvim_buf_lines_event|
        notifications (e.g. because it was too big).

nvim_buf_changedtick_event[{buf}, {changedtick}]  *nvim_buf_changedtick_event*

    When |b:changedtick| was incremented but no text was changed. Relevant for
    undo/redo.

    Properties: ~
        {buf} API buffer handle (buffer number)
        {changedtick} new value of |b:changedtick| for the buffer

nvim_buf_detach_event[{buf}]                           *nvim_buf_detach_event*

    When buffer is detached (i.e. updates are disabled). Triggered explicitly by
    |nvim_buf_detach()| or implicitly in these cases:
    - Buffer was |abandon|ed and 'hidden' is not set.
    - Buffer was reloaded, e.g. with |:edit| or an external change triggered
      |:checktime| or 'autoread'.
    - Generally: whenever the buffer contents are unloaded from memory.

    Properties: ~
        {buf} API buffer handle (buffer number)


EXAMPLE ~

Calling |nvim_buf_attach()| with send_buffer=true on an empty buffer, emits: >
    nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 0, -1, [""], v:false]

User adds two lines to the buffer, emits: >
    nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 0, 0, ["line1", "line2"], v:false]

User moves to a line containing the text "Hello world" and inserts "!", emits: >
    nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, {linenr}, {linenr} + 1,
                         ["Hello world!"], v:false]

User moves to line 3 and deletes 20 lines using "20dd", emits: >
    nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 2, 22, [], v:false]

User selects lines 3-5 using |linewise-visual| mode and then types "p" to
paste a block of 6 lines, emits: >
    nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 2, 5,
      ['pasted line 1', 'pasted line 2', 'pasted line 3', 'pasted line 4',
       'pasted line 5', 'pasted line 6'],
      v:false
    ]

User reloads the buffer with ":edit", emits: >
    nvim_buf_detach_event[{buf}]
<

LUA ~
                                                        *api-buffer-updates-lua*
In-process Lua plugins can receive buffer updates in the form of Lua
callbacks. These callbacks are called frequently in various contexts;
|textlock| prevents changing buffer contents and window layout (use
|vim.schedule()| to defer such operations to the main loop instead).
Moving the cursor is allowed, but it is restored afterwards.

|nvim_buf_attach()| will take keyword args for the callbacks. "on_lines" will
receive parameters ("lines", {buf}, {changedtick}, {firstline}, {lastline},
{new_lastline}, {old_byte_size} [, {old_utf32_size}, {old_utf16_size}]).
Unlike remote channel events the text contents are not passed. The new text can
be accessed inside the callback as >lua

    vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(buf, firstline, new_lastline, true)
<
{old_byte_size} is the total size of the replaced region {firstline} to
{lastline} in bytes, including the final newline after {lastline}. if
`utf_sizes` is set to true in |nvim_buf_attach()| keyword args, then the
UTF-32 and UTF-16 sizes of the deleted region is also passed as additional
arguments {old_utf32_size} and {old_utf16_size}.

"on_changedtick" is invoked when |b:changedtick| was incremented but no text
was changed. The parameters received are ("changedtick", {buf}, {changedtick}).

                                                        *api-lua-detach*
In-process Lua callbacks can detach by returning `true`. This will detach all
callbacks attached with the same |nvim_buf_attach()| call.


==============================================================================
Buffer highlighting                                            *api-highlights*

Nvim allows plugins to add position-based highlights to buffers. This is
similar to |matchaddpos()| but with some key differences. The added highlights
are associated with a buffer and adapts to line insertions and deletions,
similar to signs. It is also possible to manage a set of highlights as a group
and delete or replace all at once.

The intended use case are linter or semantic highlighter plugins that monitor
a buffer for changes, and in the background compute highlights to the buffer.
Another use case are plugins that show output in an append-only buffer, and
want to add highlights to the outputs. Highlight data cannot be preserved
on writing and loading a buffer to file, nor in undo/redo cycles.

Highlights are registered using the |nvim_buf_add_highlight()| function. If an
external highlighter plugin wants to add many highlights in a batch,
performance can be improved by calling |nvim_buf_add_highlight()| as an
asynchronous notification, after first (synchronously) requesting a source id.

|nvim_buf_add_highlight()| adds highlights as |extmarks|. If highlights need to
be tracked or manipulated after adding them, it is better to use
|nvim_buf_set_extmark()| directly, as this function returns the placed |extmark|
id. Thus, instead of >lua
  vim.api.nvim_buf_add_highlight(buf, ns_id, hl_group, line, col_start, col_end)
<
use >lua
  -- create the highlight through an extmark
  extid = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(buf, ns_id, line, col_start, {end_col = col_end, hl_group = hl_group})

  -- example: modify the extmark's highlight group
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(buf, ns_id, line, col_start, {end_col = col_end, hl_group = NEW_HL_GROUP, id = extid})

  -- example: change the highlight's position
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(buf, ns_id, NEW_LINE, col_start, {end_col = col_end, hl_group = NEW_HL_GROUP, id = extid})
<

Example using the Python API client (|pynvim|):
>python
    src = vim.new_highlight_source()
    buf = vim.current.buffer
    for i in range(5):
        buf.add_highlight("String",i,0,-1,src_id=src)
    # some time later ...
    buf.clear_namespace(src)
<
If the highlights don't need to be deleted or updated, just pass -1 as
src_id (this is the default in python). Use |nvim_buf_clear_namespace()| to
clear highlights from a specific source, in a specific line range or the
entire buffer by passing in the line range 0, -1 (the latter is the default in
python as used above).

Example using the API from Vimscript: >vim

    call nvim_buf_set_lines(0, 0, 0, v:true, ["test text"])
    let src = nvim_buf_add_highlight(0, 0, "String", 1, 0, 4)
    call nvim_buf_add_highlight(0, src, "Identifier", 0, 5, -1)
    " some time later ...
    call nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, src, 0, -1)


==============================================================================
Floating windows                                                 *api-floatwin*

Floating windows ("floats") are displayed on top of normal windows.  This is
useful to implement simple widgets, such as tooltips displayed next to the
cursor. Floats are fully functional windows supporting user editing, common
|api-window| calls, and most window options (except 'statusline').

Two ways to create a floating window:
- |nvim_open_win()| creates a new window (needs a buffer, see |nvim_create_buf()|)
- |nvim_win_set_config()| reconfigures a normal window into a float

To close it use |nvim_win_close()| or a command such as |:close|.

To check whether a window is floating, check whether the `relative` option in
its config is non-empty: >lua

    if vim.api.nvim_win_get_config(window_id).relative ~= '' then
      -- window with this window_id is floating
    end
<

Buffer text can be highlighted by typical mechanisms (syntax highlighting,
|api-highlights|). The |hl-NormalFloat| group highlights normal text;
'winhighlight' can be used as usual to override groups locally. Floats inherit
options from the current window; specify `style=minimal` in |nvim_open_win()|
to disable various visual features such as the 'number' column.

Other highlight groups specific to floating windows:
- |hl-FloatBorder| for window's border
- |hl-FloatTitle| for window's title
- |hl-FloatFooter| for window's footer

Currently, floating windows don't support some widgets like scrollbar.

The output of |:mksession| does not include commands for restoring floating
windows.

Example: create a float with scratch buffer: >vim

    let buf = nvim_create_buf(v:false, v:true)
    call nvim_buf_set_lines(buf, 0, -1, v:true, ["test", "text"])
    let opts = {'relative': 'cursor', 'width': 10, 'height': 2, 'col': 0,
        \ 'row': 1, 'anchor': 'NW', 'style': 'minimal'}
    let win = nvim_open_win(buf, 0, opts)
    " optional: change highlight, otherwise Pmenu is used
    call nvim_set_option_value('winhl', 'Normal:MyHighlight', {'win': win})
<

==============================================================================
Extended marks                       *api-extended-marks* *extmarks* *extmark*

Extended marks (extmarks) represent buffer annotations that track text changes
in the buffer. They can represent cursors, folds, misspelled words, anything
that needs to track a logical location in the buffer over time. |api-indexing|

Extmark position works like a "vertical bar" cursor: it exists between
characters. Thus, the maximum extmark index on a line is 1 more than the
character index: >

     f o o b a r      line contents
     0 1 2 3 4 5      character positions (0-based)
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6     extmark positions (0-based)

Extmarks have "forward gravity": if you place the cursor directly on an
extmark position and enter some text, the extmark migrates forward. >

     f o o|b a r      line (| = cursor)
          3           extmark

     f o o z|b a r    line (| = cursor)
            4         extmark (after typing "z")

If an extmark is on the last index of a line and you input a newline at that
point, the extmark will accordingly migrate to the next line: >

     f o o z b a r|   line (| = cursor)
                  7   extmark

     f o o z b a r    first line
                      extmarks (none present)
     |                second line (| = cursor)
     0                extmark (after typing <CR>)


Example:

Let's set an extmark at the first row (row=0) and third column (column=2).
|api-indexing| Passing id=0 creates a new mark and returns the id: >

      01 2345678
    0 ex|ample..
        ^ extmark position
<
>vim
    let g:mark_ns = nvim_create_namespace('myplugin')
    let g:mark_id = nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, g:mark_ns, 0, 2, {})
<
We can get the mark by its id: >vim

    echo nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id(0, g:mark_ns, g:mark_id, {})
    " => [0, 2]

We can get all marks in a buffer by |namespace| (or by a range): >vim

    echo nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, g:mark_ns, 0, -1, {})
    " => [[1, 0, 2]]

Deleting all surrounding text does NOT remove an extmark! To remove extmarks
use |nvim_buf_del_extmark()|. Deleting "x" in our example: >

      0 12345678
    0 e|ample..
       ^ extmark position
<
>vim
    echo nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id(0, g:mark_ns, g:mark_id, {})
    " => [0, 1]
<
    Note: Extmark "gravity" decides how it will shift after a text edit.
          See |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|

Namespaces allow any plugin to manage only its own extmarks, ignoring those
created by another plugin.

Extmark positions changed by an edit will be restored on undo/redo. Creating
and deleting extmarks is not a buffer change, thus new undo states are not
created for extmark changes.

Global Functions                                                  *api-global*

nvim_chan_send({chan}, {data})                              *nvim_chan_send()*
    Send data to channel `id`. For a job, it writes it to the stdin of the
    process. For the stdio channel |channel-stdio|, it writes to Nvim's
    stdout. For an internal terminal instance (|nvim_open_term()|) it writes
    directly to terminal output. See |channel-bytes| for more information.

    This function writes raw data, not RPC messages. If the channel was
    created with `rpc=true` then the channel expects RPC messages, use
    |vim.rpcnotify()| and |vim.rpcrequest()| instead.

    Attributes: ~
        |RPC| only
        Lua |vim.api| only

    Parameters: ~
      • {chan}  id of the channel
      • {data}  data to write. 8-bit clean: can contain NUL bytes.

nvim_create_buf({listed}, {scratch})                       *nvim_create_buf()*
    Creates a new, empty, unnamed buffer.

    Parameters: ~
      • {listed}   Sets 'buflisted'
      • {scratch}  Creates a "throwaway" |scratch-buffer| for temporary work
                   (always 'nomodified'). Also sets 'nomodeline' on the
                   buffer.

    Return: ~
        Buffer handle, or 0 on error

    See also: ~

    Deletes the current line.

    Attributes: ~
        not allowed when |textlock| is active

nvim_del_keymap({mode}, {lhs})                             *nvim_del_keymap()*
    Unmaps a global |mapping| for the given mode.

    To unmap a buffer-local mapping, use |nvim_buf_del_keymap()|.

nvim_del_mark({name})                                        *nvim_del_mark()*
    Deletes an uppercase/file named mark. See |mark-motions|.

    Note: ~
      • Lowercase name (or other buffer-local mark) is an error.

    Parameters: ~
      • {name}  Mark name

    Return: ~
        true if the mark was deleted, else false.

    Sends input-keys to Nvim, subject to various quirks controlled by `mode`
    flags. This is a blocking call, unlike |nvim_input()|.

    On execution error: does not fail, but updates v:errmsg.

    To input sequences like <C-o> use |nvim_replace_termcodes()| (typically
    with escape_ks=false) to replace |keycodes|, then pass the result to
    nvim_feedkeys().

    Example: >vim
        :let key = nvim_replace_termcodes("<C-o>", v:true, v:false, v:true)
        :call nvim_feedkeys(key, 'n', v:false)

    Gets the immediate children of process `pid`.

    Return: ~
        Array of child process ids, empty if process not found.

nvim_get_runtime_file({name}, {all})                 *nvim_get_runtime_file()*
    Finds files in runtime directories, in 'runtimepath' order.

    "name" can contain wildcards. For example
    `nvim_get_runtime_file("colors/*.{vim,lua}", true)` will return all color
    scheme files. Always use forward slashes (/) in the search pattern for
    subdirectories regardless of platform.

    It is not an error to not find any files. An empty array is returned then.

    Attributes: ~
        |api-fast|

    Parameters: ~
      • {name}  pattern of files to search for
      • {all}   whether to return all matches or only the first

    Return: ~
        list of absolute paths to the found files

nvim_get_var({name})                                          *nvim_get_var()*

nvim_input({keys})                                              *nvim_input()*
    Queues raw user-input. Unlike |nvim_feedkeys()|, this uses a low-level
    input buffer and the call is non-blocking (input is processed
    asynchronously by the eventloop).

    On execution error: does not fail, but updates v:errmsg.

    Note: ~
      • |keycodes| like <CR> are translated, so "<" is special. To input a
        literal "<", send <LT>.
      • For mouse events use |nvim_input_mouse()|. The pseudokey form
        `<LeftMouse><col,row>` is deprecated since |api-level| 6.

    Attributes: ~
        |api-fast|

    Parameters: ~
      • {keys}  to be typed

    Return: ~
        Number of bytes actually written (can be fewer than requested if the
        buffer becomes full).

                                                          *nvim_input_mouse()*
nvim_input_mouse({button}, {action}, {modifier}, {grid}, {row}, {col})
    Send mouse event from GUI.

    Non-blocking: does not wait on any result, but queues the event to be
    processed soon by the event loop.

    Note: ~
      • Currently this doesn't support "scripting" multiple mouse events by
        calling it multiple times in a loop: the intermediate mouse positions
        will be ignored. It should be used to implement real-time mouse input
        in a GUI. The deprecated pseudokey form (`<LeftMouse><col,row>`) of
        |nvim_input()| has the same limitation.

    Attributes: ~
        |api-fast|

    Parameters: ~
      • {button}    Mouse button: one of "left", "right", "middle", "wheel",
                    "move", "x1", "x2".
      • {action}    For ordinary buttons, one of "press", "drag", "release".
                    For the wheel, one of "up", "down", "left", "right".
                    Ignored for "move".
      • {modifier}  String of modifiers each represented by a single char. The
                    same specifiers are used as for a key press, except that
                    the "-" separator is optional, so "C-A-", "c-a" and "CA"
                    can all be used to specify Ctrl+Alt+click.
      • {grid}      Grid number if the client uses |ui-multigrid|, else 0.
      • {row}       Mouse row-position (zero-based, like redraw events)
      • {col}       Mouse column-position (zero-based, like redraw events)

nvim_list_bufs()                                            *nvim_list_bufs()*
    Gets the current list of buffer handles

    Includes unlisted (unloaded/deleted) buffers, like `:ls!`. Use
    |nvim_buf_is_loaded()| to check if a buffer is loaded.

    Return: ~
        List of buffer handles

nvim_list_chans()                                          *nvim_list_chans()*
    Get information about all open channels.

    Return: ~
        Array of Dictionaries, each describing a channel with the format
        specified at |nvim_get_chan_info()|.

nvim_list_runtime_paths()                          *nvim_list_runtime_paths()*
    Gets the paths contained in |runtime-search-path|.

    Return: ~
        List of paths

nvim_list_tabpages()                                    *nvim_list_tabpages()*
    Gets the current list of tabpage handles.

    Return: ~
        List of tabpage handles

nvim_list_uis()                                              *nvim_list_uis()*
    Gets a list of dictionaries representing attached UIs.

    Return: ~
        Array of UI dictionaries, each with these keys:
        • "height" Requested height of the UI
        • "width" Requested width of the UI
        • "rgb" true if the UI uses RGB colors (false implies |cterm-colors|)
        • "ext_..." Requested UI extensions, see |ui-option|
        • "chan" |channel-id| of remote UI

nvim_list_wins()                                            *nvim_list_wins()*
    Gets the current list of window handles.

    Return: ~
        List of window handles

nvim_load_context({dict})                                *nvim_load_context()*
    Sets the current editor state from the given |context| map.

    Parameters: ~
      • {dict}  |Context| map.

nvim_notify({msg}, {log_level}, {opts})                        *nvim_notify()*
    Notify the user with a message

    Relays the call to vim.notify . By default forwards your message in the
    echo area but can be overridden to trigger desktop notifications.

    Parameters: ~
      • {msg}        Message to display to the user
      • {log_level}  The log level
      • {opts}       Reserved for future use.

nvim_open_term({buffer}, {opts})                            *nvim_open_term()*
    Open a terminal instance in a buffer

    By default (and currently the only option) the terminal will not be
    connected to an external process. Instead, input send on the channel will
    be echoed directly by the terminal. This is useful to display ANSI
    terminal sequences returned as part of a rpc message, or similar.

    Note: to directly initiate the terminal using the right size, display the
    buffer in a configured window before calling this. For instance, for a
    floating display, first create an empty buffer using |nvim_create_buf()|,
    then display it using |nvim_open_win()|, and then call this function. Then
    |nvim_chan_send()| can be called immediately to process sequences in a
    virtual terminal having the intended size.

    Attributes: ~
        not allowed when |textlock| is active

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  the buffer to use (expected to be empty)
      • {opts}    Optional parameters.
                  • on_input: Lua callback for input sent, i e keypresses in
                    terminal mode. Note: keypresses are sent raw as they would
                    be to the pty master end. For instance, a carriage return
                    is sent as a "\r", not as a "\n". |textlock| applies. It
                    is possible to call |nvim_chan_send()| directly in the
                    callback however. `["input", term, bufnr, data]`
                  • force_crlf: (boolean, default true) Convert "\n" to
                    "\r\n".

    Return: ~
        Channel id, or 0 on error

nvim_out_write({str})                                       *nvim_out_write()*
    Writes a message to the Vim output buffer. Does not append "\n", the
    message is buffered (won't display) until a linefeed is written.

    Parameters: ~
      • {str}  Message

nvim_paste({data}, {crlf}, {phase})                             *nvim_paste()*
    Pastes at cursor, in any mode.

    Invokes the `vim.paste` handler, which handles each mode appropriately.
    Sets redo/undo. Faster than |nvim_input()|. Lines break at LF ("\n").

    Errors ('nomodifiable', `vim.paste()` failure, …) are reflected in `err`
    but do not affect the return value (which is strictly decided by
    `vim.paste()`). On error, subsequent calls are ignored ("drained") until
    the next paste is initiated (phase 1 or -1).

    Attributes: ~
        not allowed when |textlock| is active

    Parameters: ~
      • {data}   Multiline input. May be binary (containing NUL bytes).
      • {crlf}   Also break lines at CR and CRLF.
      • {phase}  -1: paste in a single call (i.e. without streaming). To
                 "stream" a paste, call `nvim_paste` sequentially with these
                 `phase` values:
                 • 1: starts the paste (exactly once)
                 • 2: continues the paste (zero or more times)
                 • 3: ends the paste (exactly once)

    Return: ~
        • true: Client may continue pasting.
        • false: Client must cancel the paste.

nvim_put({lines}, {type}, {after}, {follow})                      *nvim_put()*
    Puts text at cursor, in any mode.

    Compare |:put| and |p| which are always linewise.

    Attributes: ~
        not allowed when |textlock| is active

    Parameters: ~
      • {lines}   |readfile()|-style list of lines. |channel-lines|
      • {type}    Edit behavior: any |getregtype()| result, or:
                  • "b" |blockwise-visual| mode (may include width, e.g. "b3")
                  • "c" |charwise| mode
                  • "l" |linewise| mode
                  • "" guess by contents, see |setreg()|
      • {after}   If true insert after cursor (like |p|), or before (like
                  |P|).
      • {follow}  If true place cursor at end of inserted text.

                                                    *nvim_replace_termcodes()*
nvim_replace_termcodes({str}, {from_part}, {do_lt}, {special})
    Replaces terminal codes and |keycodes| (<CR>, <Esc>, ...) in a string with
    the internal representation.

    Parameters: ~
      • {str}        String to be converted.
      • {from_part}  Legacy Vim parameter. Usually true.
      • {do_lt}      Also translate <lt>. Ignored if `special` is false.
      • {special}    Replace |keycodes|, e.g. <CR> becomes a "\r" char.

    See also: ~
      • replace_termcodes
      • cpoptions

                                                *nvim_select_popupmenu_item()*
nvim_select_popupmenu_item({item}, {insert}, {finish}, {opts})
    Selects an item in the completion popup menu.

    If neither |ins-completion| nor |cmdline-completion| popup menu is active
    this API call is silently ignored. Useful for an external UI using
    |ui-popupmenu| to control the popup menu with the mouse. Can also be used
    in a mapping; use <Cmd> |:map-cmd| or a Lua mapping to ensure the mapping
    doesn't end completion mode.

    Parameters: ~
      • {item}    Index (zero-based) of the item to select. Value of -1
                  selects nothing and restores the original text.
      • {insert}  For |ins-completion|, whether the selection should be
                  inserted in the buffer. Ignored for |cmdline-completion|.
      • {finish}  Finish the completion and dismiss the popup menu. Implies
                  {insert}.
      • {opts}    Optional parameters. Reserved for future use.

                                                      *nvim_set_client_info()*
nvim_set_client_info({name}, {version}, {type}, {methods}, {attributes})
    Self-identifies the client.

    The client/plugin/application should call this after connecting, to
    provide hints about its identity and purpose, for debugging and
    orchestration.

    Can be called more than once; the caller should merge old info if
    appropriate. Example: library first identifies the channel, then a plugin
    using that library later identifies itself.

    Note: ~
      • "Something is better than nothing". You don't need to include all the
        fields.

    Attributes: ~
        |RPC| only

nvim_set_hl({ns_id}, {name}, {val})                            *nvim_set_hl()*
    Sets a highlight group.

    Note: ~
      • Unlike the `:highlight` command which can update a highlight group,
        this function completely replaces the definition. For example:
        `nvim_set_hl(0, 'Visual', {})` will clear the highlight group
        'Visual'.
      • The fg and bg keys also accept the string values `"fg"` or `"bg"`
        which act as aliases to the corresponding foreground and background
        values of the Normal group. If the Normal group has not been defined,
        using these values results in an error.
      • If `link` is used in combination with other attributes; only the
        `link` will take effect (see |:hi-link|).

    Parameters: ~
      • {ns_id}  Namespace id for this highlight |nvim_create_namespace()|.
                 Use 0 to set a highlight group globally |:highlight|.
                 Highlights from non-global namespaces are not active by
                 default, use |nvim_set_hl_ns()| or |nvim_win_set_hl_ns()| to
                 activate them.
      • {name}   Highlight group name, e.g. "ErrorMsg"
      • {val}    Highlight definition map, accepts the following keys:
                 • fg: color name or "#RRGGBB", see note.
                 • bg: color name or "#RRGGBB", see note.
                 • sp: color name or "#RRGGBB"
                 • blend: integer between 0 and 100
                 • bold: boolean
                 • standout: boolean
                 • underline: boolean

                 • reverse: boolean
                 • nocombine: boolean
                 • link: name of another highlight group to link to, see
                   |:hi-link|.
                 • default: Don't override existing definition |:hi-default|
                 • ctermfg: Sets foreground of cterm color |ctermfg|
                 • ctermbg: Sets background of cterm color |ctermbg|
                 • cterm: cterm attribute map, like |highlight-args|. If not
                   set, cterm attributes will match those from the attribute
                   map documented above.
                 • force: if true force update the highlight group when it
                   exists.

nvim_set_hl_ns({ns_id})                                     *nvim_set_hl_ns()*
    Set active namespace for highlights defined with |nvim_set_hl()|. This can
    be set for a single window, see |nvim_win_set_hl_ns()|.

    Parameters: ~
      • {ns_id}  the namespace to use

nvim_set_hl_ns_fast({ns_id})                           *nvim_set_hl_ns_fast()*
    Set active namespace for highlights defined with |nvim_set_hl()| while
    redrawing.

    This function meant to be called while redrawing, primarily from
    |nvim_set_decoration_provider()| on_win and on_line callbacks, which are
    allowed to change the namespace during a redraw cycle.

    Attributes: ~
        |api-fast|

    Parameters: ~
      • {ns_id}  the namespace to activate

nvim_set_keymap({mode}, {lhs}, {rhs}, {opts})              *nvim_set_keymap()*
    Sets a global |mapping| for the given mode.

    To set a buffer-local mapping, use |nvim_buf_set_keymap()|.

    Unlike |:map|, leading/trailing whitespace is accepted as part of the
    {lhs} or {rhs}. Empty {rhs} is <Nop>. |keycodes| are replaced as usual.

    Example: >vim
        call nvim_set_keymap('n', ' <NL>', '', {'nowait': v:true})
<

    is equivalent to: >vim
        nmap <nowait> <Space><NL> <Nop>
<

    Parameters: ~
      • {mode}  Mode short-name (map command prefix: "n", "i", "v", "x", …)
                or "!" for |:map!|, or empty string for |:map|. "ia", "ca" or
                "!a" for abbreviation in Insert mode, Cmdline mode, or both,
                respectively
      • {lhs}   Left-hand-side |{lhs}| of the mapping.
      • {rhs}   Right-hand-side |{rhs}| of the mapping.
      • {opts}  Optional parameters map: Accepts all |:map-arguments| as keys
                except <buffer>, values are booleans (default false). Also:
                • "noremap" disables |recursive_mapping|, like |:noremap|
                • "desc" human-readable description.
                • "callback" Lua function called in place of {rhs}.
                • "replace_keycodes" (boolean) When "expr" is true, replace
                  keycodes in the resulting string (see
                  |nvim_replace_termcodes()|). Returning nil from the Lua

    On execution error: fails with Vimscript error, updates v:errmsg.

    Prefer using |nvim_cmd()| or |nvim_exec2()| over this. To evaluate
    multiple lines of Vim script or an Ex command directly, use
    |nvim_exec2()|. To construct an Ex command using a structured format and

    evaluating it, use |nvim_parse_cmd()| in conjunction with |nvim_cmd()|.

    Parameters: ~
      • {command}  Ex command string

                       the first one will be parsed),
                     • "E" if EOC tokens are not allowed (determines whether
                       they will stop parsing process or be recognized as an
                       operator/space, though also yielding an error).
                     • "l" when needing to start parsing with lvalues for
                       ":let" or ":for". Common flag sets:

                     Integer, String), where first three numbers define the
                     highlighted region and represent line, starting column
                     and ending column (latter exclusive: one should highlight
                     region [start_col, end_col)).

    Return: ~
        • AST: top-level dictionary with these keys:
          • "error": Dictionary with error, present only if parser saw some
            error. Contains the following keys:
            • "message": String, error message in printf format, translated.
              Must contain exactly one "%.*s".
            • "arg": String, error message argument.
          • "len": Amount of bytes successfully parsed. With flags equal to ""
            that should be equal to the length of expr string. ("Successfully

            • "start": a pair `[line, column]` describing where node is
              "started" where "line" is always 0 (will not be 0 if you will be
              using this API on e.g. ":let", but that is not present yet).
              Both elements are Integers.
            • "len": “length” of the node. This and "start" are there for
              debugging purposes primary (debugging parser and providing debug
              information).
            • "children": a list of nodes described in top/"ast". There always
              is zero, one or two children, key will not be present if node
              has no children. Maximum number of children may be found in
              node_maxchildren array.
        • Local values (present only for certain nodes):
          • "scope": a single Integer, specifies scope for "Option" and
            "PlainIdentifier" nodes. For "Option" it is one of ExprOptScope
            values, for "PlainIdentifier" it is one of ExprVarScope values.
          • "ident": identifier (without scope, if any), present for "Option",
            "PlainIdentifier", "PlainKey" and "Environment" nodes.

            names from ExprCaseCompareStrategy, stringified without
            "kCCStrategy" prefix. Only present for "Comparison" nodes.
          • "augmentation": String, augmentation type for "Assignment" nodes.
            Is either an empty string, "Add", "Subtract" or "Concat" for "=",
            "+=", "-=" or ".=" respectively.

Command Functions                                                *api-command*

                                              *nvim_buf_create_user_command()*
nvim_buf_create_user_command({buffer}, {name}, {command}, {opts})
    Creates a buffer-local command |user-commands|.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}   Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer.

    See also: ~
      • nvim_create_user_command

                                                 *nvim_buf_del_user_command()*
nvim_buf_del_user_command({buffer}, {name})
    Delete a buffer-local user-defined command.

    Only commands created with |:command-buffer| or
    |nvim_buf_create_user_command()| can be deleted with this function.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer.
      • {name}    Name of the command to delete.

nvim_buf_get_commands({buffer}, {opts})              *nvim_buf_get_commands()*
    Gets a map of buffer-local |user-commands|.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {opts}    Optional parameters. Currently not used.

    Return: ~
        Map of maps describing commands.

nvim_cmd({cmd}, {opts})                                           *nvim_cmd()*
    Executes an Ex command.

    Unlike |nvim_command()| this command takes a structured Dictionary instead
    of a String. This allows for easier construction and manipulation of an Ex
    command. This also allows for things such as having spaces inside a
    command argument, expanding filenames in a command that otherwise doesn't
    expand filenames, etc. Command arguments may also be Number, Boolean or
    String.

    The first argument may also be used instead of count for commands that
    support it in order to make their usage simpler with |vim.cmd()|. For
    example, instead of `vim.cmd.bdelete{ count = 2 }`, you may do
    `vim.cmd.bdelete(2)`.

    On execution error: fails with Vimscript error, updates v:errmsg.

    Parameters: ~
      • {cmd}   Command to execute. Must be a Dictionary that can contain the
                same values as the return value of |nvim_parse_cmd()| except
                "addr", "nargs" and "nextcmd" which are ignored if provided.
                All values except for "cmd" are optional.
      • {opts}  Optional parameters.
                • output: (boolean, default false) Whether to return command
                  output.

    Return: ~
        Command output (non-error, non-shell |:!|) if `output` is true, else
        empty string.

    See also: ~
      • |nvim_exec2()|

                   letter.
      • {command}  Replacement command to execute when this user command is
                   executed. When called from Lua, the command can also be a
                   Lua function. The function is called with a single table
                   argument that contains the following keys:
                   • name: (string) Command name
                   • args: (string) The args passed to the command, if any
                     <args>
                   • fargs: (table) The args split by unescaped whitespace
                     (when more than one argument is allowed), if any <f-args>

                   • smods: (table) Command modifiers in a structured format.
                     Has the same structure as the "mods" key of
                     |nvim_parse_cmd()|.
      • {opts}     Optional |command-attributes|.
                   • Set boolean attributes such as |:command-bang| or
                     |:command-bar| to true (but not |:command-buffer|, use
                     |nvim_buf_create_user_command()| instead).
                   • "complete" |:command-complete| also accepts a Lua
                     function which works like
                     |:command-completion-customlist|.
                   • Other parameters:
                     • desc: (string) Used for listing the command when a Lua

Options Functions                                                *api-options*

nvim_get_all_options_info()                      *nvim_get_all_options_info()*
    Gets the option information for all options.

    The dictionary has the full option names as keys and option metadata
    dictionaries as detailed at |nvim_get_option_info2()|.

    Return: ~
        dictionary of all options

    See also: ~
      • |nvim_get_commands()|

nvim_get_option_info2({name}, {opts})                *nvim_get_option_info2()*
    Gets the option information for one option from arbitrary buffer or window

    Resulting dictionary has keys:
    • name: Name of the option (like 'filetype')
    • shortname: Shortened name of the option (like 'ft')
    • type: type of option ("string", "number" or "boolean")
    • default: The default value for the option
    • was_set: Whether the option was set.
    • last_set_sid: Last set script id (if any)
    • last_set_linenr: line number where option was set
    • last_set_chan: Channel where option was set (0 for local)
    • scope: one of "global", "win", or "buf"
    • global_local: whether win or buf option has a global value
    • commalist: List of comma separated values
    • flaglist: List of single char flags

    When {scope} is not provided, the last set information applies to the
    local value in the current buffer or window if it is available, otherwise
    the global value information is returned. This behavior can be disabled by
    explicitly specifying {scope} in the {opts} table.

    Parameters: ~
      • {name}  Option name
      • {opts}  Optional parameters
                • scope: One of "global" or "local". Analogous to |:setglobal|
                  and |:setlocal|, respectively.
                • win: |window-ID|. Used for getting window local options.
                • buf: Buffer number. Used for getting buffer local options.
                  Implies {scope} is "local".

    Return: ~
        Option Information

nvim_get_option_value({name}, {opts})                *nvim_get_option_value()*
    Gets the value of an option. The behavior of this function matches that of
    |:set|: the local value of an option is returned if it exists; otherwise,
    the global value is returned. Local values always correspond to the
    current buffer or window, unless "buf" or "win" is set in {opts}.

    Parameters: ~
      • {name}  Option name
      • {opts}  Optional parameters
                • scope: One of "global" or "local". Analogous to |:setglobal|
                  and |:setlocal|, respectively.
                • win: |window-ID|. Used for getting window local options.
                • buf: Buffer number. Used for getting buffer local options.
                  Implies {scope} is "local".
                • filetype: |filetype|. Used to get the default option for a
                  specific filetype. Cannot be used with any other option.
                  Note: this will trigger |ftplugin| and all |FileType|
                  autocommands for the corresponding filetype.

    Return: ~
        Option value

                                                     *nvim_set_option_value()*
nvim_set_option_value({name}, {value}, {opts})
    Sets the value of an option. The behavior of this function matches that of
    |:set|: for global-local options, both the global and local value are set
    unless otherwise specified with {scope}.

    Note the options {win} and {buf} cannot be used together.

    Parameters: ~
      • {name}   Option name
      • {value}  New option value
      • {opts}   Optional parameters
                 • scope: One of "global" or "local". Analogous to
                   |:setglobal| and |:setlocal|, respectively.
                 • win: |window-ID|. Used for setting window local option.
                 • buf: Buffer number. Used for setting buffer local option.

Buffer Functions                                                  *api-buffer*


For more information on buffers, see |buffers|.

Unloaded Buffers: ~

Buffers may be unloaded by the |:bunload| command or the buffer's
|'bufhidden'| option. When a buffer is unloaded its file contents are freed
from memory and vim cannot operate on the buffer lines until it is reloaded
(usually by opening the buffer again in a new window). API methods such as
|nvim_buf_get_lines()| and |nvim_buf_line_count()| will be affected.

You can use |nvim_buf_is_loaded()| or |nvim_buf_line_count()| to check
whether a buffer is loaded.


nvim_buf_attach({buffer}, {send_buffer}, {opts})           *nvim_buf_attach()*
    Activates buffer-update events on a channel, or as Lua callbacks.

    Example (Lua): capture buffer updates in a global `events` variable (use
    "vim.print(events)" to see its contents): >lua
        events = {}
        vim.api.nvim_buf_attach(0, false, {
          on_lines = function(...)
            table.insert(events, {...})
          end,
        })
<

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}       Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {send_buffer}  True if the initial notification should contain the
                       whole buffer: first notification will be
                       `nvim_buf_lines_event`. Else the first notification
                       will be `nvim_buf_changedtick_event`. Not for Lua
                       callbacks.
      • {opts}         Optional parameters.
                       • on_lines: Lua callback invoked on change. Return a
                         truthy value (not `false` or `nil`) to detach. Args:
                         • the string "lines"
                         • buffer handle
                         • b:changedtick
                         • first line that changed (zero-indexed)
                         • last line that was changed
                         • last line in the updated range
                         • byte count of previous contents
                         • deleted_codepoints (if `utf_sizes` is true)
                         • deleted_codeunits (if `utf_sizes` is true)
                       • on_bytes: Lua callback invoked on change. This
                         callback receives more granular information about the
                         change compared to on_lines. Return a truthy value
                         (not `false` or `nil`) to detach. Args:
                         • the string "bytes"

                           the buffer)
                         • old end row of the changed text (offset from start
                           row)
                         • old end column of the changed text (if old end row
                           = 0, offset from start column)
                         • old end byte length of the changed text
                         • new end row of the changed text (offset from start
                           row)
                         • new end column of the changed text (if new end row
                           = 0, offset from start column)

                       • on_detach: Lua callback invoked on detach. Args:
                         • the string "detach"
                         • buffer handle
                       • on_reload: Lua callback invoked on reload. The entire
                         buffer content should be considered changed. Args:
                         • the string "reload"
                         • buffer handle
                       • utf_sizes: include UTF-32 and UTF-16 size of the
                         replaced region, as args to `on_lines`.
                       • preview: also attach to command preview (i.e.
                         'inccommand') events.

nvim_buf_call({buffer}, {fun})                               *nvim_buf_call()*
    Call a function with buffer as temporary current buffer.

    This temporarily switches current buffer to "buffer". If the current
    window already shows "buffer", the window is not switched. If a window
    inside the current tabpage (including a float) already shows the buffer,
    then one of these windows will be set as current window temporarily.
    Otherwise a temporary scratch window (called the "autocmd window" for
    historical reasons) will be used.

    This is useful e.g. to call Vimscript functions that only work with the
    current buffer/window currently, like |termopen()|.

    Attributes: ~
        Lua |vim.api| only

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {fun}     Function to call inside the buffer (currently Lua callable
                  only)

    Return: ~
        Return value of function.

nvim_buf_del_keymap({buffer}, {mode}, {lhs})           *nvim_buf_del_keymap()*
    Unmaps a buffer-local |mapping| for the given mode.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

    See also: ~
      • |nvim_del_keymap()|

nvim_buf_del_mark({buffer}, {name})                      *nvim_buf_del_mark()*
    Deletes a named mark in the buffer. See |mark-motions|.

    Note: ~
      • only deletes marks set in the buffer, if the mark is not set in the
        buffer it will return false.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer to set the mark on
      • {name}    Mark name

    Return: ~
        true if the mark was deleted, else false.

      • |nvim_buf_set_mark()|
      • |nvim_del_mark()|

nvim_buf_del_var({buffer}, {name})                        *nvim_buf_del_var()*
    Removes a buffer-scoped (b:) variable

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {name}    Variable name

nvim_buf_delete({buffer}, {opts})                          *nvim_buf_delete()*
    Deletes the buffer. See |:bwipeout|

    Attributes: ~
        not allowed when |textlock| is active or in the |cmdwin|

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {opts}    Optional parameters. Keys:
                  • force: Force deletion and ignore unsaved changes.
                  • unload: Unloaded only, do not delete. See |:bunload|

nvim_buf_detach({buffer})                                  *nvim_buf_detach()*
    Deactivates buffer-update events on the channel.

    Attributes: ~
        |RPC| only

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

    Return: ~
        False if detach failed (because the buffer isn't loaded); otherwise
        True.

    See also: ~
      • |nvim_buf_attach()|
      • |api-lua-detach| for detaching Lua callbacks

nvim_buf_get_changedtick({buffer})                *nvim_buf_get_changedtick()*
    Gets a changed tick of a buffer

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

    Return: ~
        `b:changedtick` value.

nvim_buf_get_keymap({buffer}, {mode})                  *nvim_buf_get_keymap()*
    Gets a list of buffer-local |mapping| definitions.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {mode}    Mode short-name ("n", "i", "v", ...)

    Return: ~
        Array of |maparg()|-like dictionaries describing mappings. The
        "buffer" key holds the associated buffer handle.

                                                        *nvim_buf_get_lines()*
nvim_buf_get_lines({buffer}, {start}, {end}, {strict_indexing})
    Gets a line-range from the buffer.

    Indexing is zero-based, end-exclusive. Negative indices are interpreted as
    length+1+index: -1 refers to the index past the end. So to get the last
    element use start=-2 and end=-1.

    Out-of-bounds indices are clamped to the nearest valid value, unless
    `strict_indexing` is set.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}           Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {start}            First line index
      • {end}              Last line index, exclusive
      • {strict_indexing}  Whether out-of-bounds should be an error.

    Return: ~
        Array of lines, or empty array for unloaded buffer.

nvim_buf_get_mark({buffer}, {name})                      *nvim_buf_get_mark()*
    Returns a `(row,col)` tuple representing the position of the named mark.
    "End of line" column position is returned as |v:maxcol| (big number). See
    |mark-motions|.

    Marks are (1,0)-indexed. |api-indexing|

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {name}    Mark name

    Return: ~
        (row, col) tuple, (0, 0) if the mark is not set, or is an
        uppercase/file mark set in another buffer.

    See also: ~
      • |nvim_buf_set_mark()|
      • |nvim_buf_del_mark()|

nvim_buf_get_name({buffer})                              *nvim_buf_get_name()*
    Gets the full file name for the buffer

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

    Return: ~
        Buffer name

nvim_buf_get_offset({buffer}, {index})                 *nvim_buf_get_offset()*
    Returns the byte offset of a line (0-indexed). |api-indexing|

    Line 1 (index=0) has offset 0. UTF-8 bytes are counted. EOL is one byte.
    'fileformat' and 'fileencoding' are ignored. The line index just after the
    last line gives the total byte-count of the buffer. A final EOL byte is
    counted if it would be written, see 'eol'.

    Unlike |line2byte()|, throws error for out-of-bounds indexing. Returns -1
    for unloaded buffer.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {index}   Line index

    Return: ~
        Integer byte offset, or -1 for unloaded buffer.

                                                         *nvim_buf_get_text()*
nvim_buf_get_text({buffer}, {start_row}, {start_col}, {end_row}, {end_col},
                  {opts})
    Gets a range from the buffer.

    This differs from |nvim_buf_get_lines()| in that it allows retrieving only
    portions of a line.

    Indexing is zero-based. Row indices are end-inclusive, and column indices
    are end-exclusive.

    Prefer |nvim_buf_get_lines()| when retrieving entire lines.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}     Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {start_row}  First line index
      • {start_col}  Starting column (byte offset) on first line
      • {end_row}    Last line index, inclusive
      • {end_col}    Ending column (byte offset) on last line, exclusive
      • {opts}       Optional parameters. Currently unused.

    Return: ~
        Array of lines, or empty array for unloaded buffer.

nvim_buf_get_var({buffer}, {name})                        *nvim_buf_get_var()*
    Gets a buffer-scoped (b:) variable.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {name}    Variable name

    Return: ~
        Variable value

nvim_buf_is_loaded({buffer})                            *nvim_buf_is_loaded()*
    Checks if a buffer is valid and loaded. See |api-buffer| for more info
    about unloaded buffers.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

    Return: ~
        true if the buffer is valid and loaded, false otherwise.

nvim_buf_is_valid({buffer})                              *nvim_buf_is_valid()*
    Checks if a buffer is valid.

    Note: ~
      • Even if a buffer is valid it may have been unloaded. See |api-buffer|
        for more info about unloaded buffers.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

    Return: ~
        true if the buffer is valid, false otherwise.

nvim_buf_line_count({buffer})                          *nvim_buf_line_count()*
    Returns the number of lines in the given buffer.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

    Return: ~
        Line count, or 0 for unloaded buffer. |api-buffer|

                                                       *nvim_buf_set_keymap()*
nvim_buf_set_keymap({buffer}, {mode}, {lhs}, {rhs}, {opts})
    Sets a buffer-local |mapping| for the given mode.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer

                                                        *nvim_buf_set_lines()*
nvim_buf_set_lines({buffer}, {start}, {end}, {strict_indexing}, {replacement})
    Sets (replaces) a line-range in the buffer.

    Indexing is zero-based, end-exclusive. Negative indices are interpreted as
    length+1+index: -1 refers to the index past the end. So to change or
    delete the last element use start=-2 and end=-1.

    To insert lines at a given index, set `start` and `end` to the same index.
    To delete a range of lines, set `replacement` to an empty array.

    Out-of-bounds indices are clamped to the nearest valid value, unless
    `strict_indexing` is set.

    Attributes: ~
        not allowed when |textlock| is active

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}           Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {start}            First line index
      • {end}              Last line index, exclusive
      • {strict_indexing}  Whether out-of-bounds should be an error.
      • {replacement}      Array of lines to use as replacement

                                                         *nvim_buf_set_mark()*
nvim_buf_set_mark({buffer}, {name}, {line}, {col}, {opts})
    Sets a named mark in the given buffer, all marks are allowed
    file/uppercase, visual, last change, etc. See |mark-motions|.

    Marks are (1,0)-indexed. |api-indexing|

    Note: ~
      • Passing 0 as line deletes the mark

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer to set the mark on
      • {name}    Mark name
      • {line}    Line number
      • {col}     Column/row number
      • {opts}    Optional parameters. Reserved for future use.

    Return: ~
        true if the mark was set, else false.

nvim_buf_set_name({buffer}, {name})                      *nvim_buf_set_name()*
    Sets the full file name for a buffer, like |:file_f|

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {name}    Buffer name

                                                         *nvim_buf_set_text()*
nvim_buf_set_text({buffer}, {start_row}, {start_col}, {end_row}, {end_col},
                  {replacement})
    Sets (replaces) a range in the buffer

    This is recommended over |nvim_buf_set_lines()| when only modifying parts
    of a line, as extmarks will be preserved on non-modified parts of the
    touched lines.

    Indexing is zero-based. Row indices are end-inclusive, and column indices
    are end-exclusive.

    To insert text at a given `(row, column)` location, use
    `start_row = end_row = row` and `start_col = end_col = col`. To delete the
    text in a range, use `replacement = {}`.

    Prefer |nvim_buf_set_lines()| if you are only adding or deleting entire
    lines.

    Prefer |nvim_put()| if you want to insert text at the cursor position.

    Attributes: ~
        not allowed when |textlock| is active

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}       Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {start_row}    First line index
      • {start_col}    Starting column (byte offset) on first line
      • {end_row}      Last line index, inclusive
      • {end_col}      Ending column (byte offset) on last line, exclusive
      • {replacement}  Array of lines to use as replacement

nvim_buf_set_var({buffer}, {name}, {value})               *nvim_buf_set_var()*
    Sets a buffer-scoped (b:) variable

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {name}    Variable name
      • {value}   Variable value

Extmark Functions                                                *api-extmark*

                                                    *nvim_buf_add_highlight()*
nvim_buf_add_highlight({buffer}, {ns_id}, {hl_group}, {line}, {col_start},
                       {col_end})
    Adds a highlight to buffer.

    Useful for plugins that dynamically generate highlights to a buffer (like
    a semantic highlighter or linter). The function adds a single highlight to
    a buffer. Unlike |matchaddpos()| highlights follow changes to line
    numbering (as lines are inserted/removed above the highlighted line), like
    signs and marks do.

    Namespaces are used for batch deletion/updating of a set of highlights. To
    create a namespace, use |nvim_create_namespace()| which returns a
    namespace id. Pass it in to this function as `ns_id` to add highlights to
    the namespace. All highlights in the same namespace can then be cleared
    with single call to |nvim_buf_clear_namespace()|. If the highlight never
    will be deleted by an API call, pass `ns_id = -1`.

    As a shorthand, `ns_id = 0` can be used to create a new namespace for the
    highlight, the allocated id is then returned. If `hl_group` is the empty
    string no highlight is added, but a new `ns_id` is still returned. This is
    supported for backwards compatibility, new code should use
    |nvim_create_namespace()| to create a new empty namespace.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}     Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {ns_id}      namespace to use or -1 for ungrouped highlight
      • {hl_group}   Name of the highlight group to use
      • {line}       Line to highlight (zero-indexed)
      • {col_start}  Start of (byte-indexed) column range to highlight
      • {col_end}    End of (byte-indexed) column range to highlight, or -1 to
                     highlight to end of line

    Return: ~
        The ns_id that was used

                                                  *nvim_buf_clear_namespace()*
nvim_buf_clear_namespace({buffer}, {ns_id}, {line_start}, {line_end})
    Clears |namespace|d objects (highlights, |extmarks|, virtual text) from a
    region.

    Lines are 0-indexed. |api-indexing| To clear the namespace in the entire
    buffer, specify line_start=0 and line_end=-1.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}      Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {ns_id}       Namespace to clear, or -1 to clear all namespaces.
      • {line_start}  Start of range of lines to clear
      • {line_end}    End of range of lines to clear (exclusive) or -1 to
                      clear to end of buffer.

nvim_buf_del_extmark({buffer}, {ns_id}, {id})         *nvim_buf_del_extmark()*
    Removes an |extmark|.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {ns_id}   Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()|
      • {id}      Extmark id

    Return: ~
        true if the extmark was found, else false

                                                *nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id()*
nvim_buf_get_extmark_by_id({buffer}, {ns_id}, {id}, {opts})
    Gets the position (0-indexed) of an |extmark|.

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {ns_id}   Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()|
      • {id}      Extmark id
      • {opts}    Optional parameters. Keys:
                  • details: Whether to include the details dict
                  • hl_name: Whether to include highlight group name instead
                    of id, true if omitted

    Return: ~
        0-indexed (row, col) tuple or empty list () if extmark id was absent

                                                     *nvim_buf_get_extmarks()*
nvim_buf_get_extmarks({buffer}, {ns_id}, {start}, {end}, {opts})
    Gets |extmarks| in "traversal order" from a |charwise| region defined by
    buffer positions (inclusive, 0-indexed |api-indexing|).

    Region can be given as (row,col) tuples, or valid extmark ids (whose
    positions define the bounds). 0 and -1 are understood as (0,0) and (-1,-1)
    respectively, thus the following are equivalent: >lua
        vim.api.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, my_ns, 0, -1, {})
        vim.api.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, my_ns, {0,0}, {-1,-1}, {})
<

    If `end` is less than `start`, traversal works backwards. (Useful with
    `limit`, to get the first marks prior to a given position.)

    Note: when using extmark ranges (marks with a end_row/end_col position)
    the `overlap` option might be useful. Otherwise only the start position of
    an extmark will be considered.

    Note: legacy signs placed through the |:sign| commands are implemented as
    extmarks and will show up here. Their details array will contain a
    `sign_name` field.

    Example: >lua
        local api = vim.api
        local pos = api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
        local ns  = api.nvim_create_namespace('my-plugin')
        -- Create new extmark at line 1, column 1.
        local m1  = api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns, 0, 0, {})
        -- Create new extmark at line 3, column 1.
        local m2  = api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns, 2, 0, {})
        -- Get extmarks only from line 3.
        local ms  = api.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, ns, {2,0}, {2,0}, {})
        -- Get all marks in this buffer + namespace.
        local all = api.nvim_buf_get_extmarks(0, ns, 0, -1, {})
        vim.print(ms)
<

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {ns_id}   Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()| or -1 for all
                  namespaces
      • {start}   Start of range: a 0-indexed (row, col) or valid extmark id
                  (whose position defines the bound). |api-indexing|
      • {end}     End of range (inclusive): a 0-indexed (row, col) or valid
                  extmark id (whose position defines the bound).
                  |api-indexing|
      • {opts}    Optional parameters. Keys:
                  • limit: Maximum number of marks to return
                  • details: Whether to include the details dict
                  • hl_name: Whether to include highlight group name instead
                    of id, true if omitted
                  • overlap: Also include marks which overlap the range, even
                    if their start position is less than `start`
                  • type: Filter marks by type: "highlight", "sign",
                    "virt_text" and "virt_lines"

    Return: ~
        List of `[extmark_id, row, col]` tuples in "traversal order".

                                                      *nvim_buf_set_extmark()*
nvim_buf_set_extmark({buffer}, {ns_id}, {line}, {col}, {opts})
    Creates or updates an |extmark|.

    By default a new extmark is created when no id is passed in, but it is
    also possible to create a new mark by passing in a previously unused id or
    move an existing mark by passing in its id. The caller must then keep
    track of existing and unused ids itself. (Useful over RPC, to avoid
    waiting for the return value.)

    Using the optional arguments, it is possible to use this to highlight a
    range of text, and also to associate virtual text to the mark.

    If present, the position defined by `end_col` and `end_row` should be
    after the start position in order for the extmark to cover a range. An
    earlier end position is not an error, but then it behaves like an empty
    range (no highlighting).

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
      • {ns_id}   Namespace id from |nvim_create_namespace()|
      • {line}    Line where to place the mark, 0-based. |api-indexing|
      • {col}     Column where to place the mark, 0-based. |api-indexing|
      • {opts}    Optional parameters.
                  • id : id of the extmark to edit.
                  • end_row : ending line of the mark, 0-based inclusive.
                  • end_col : ending col of the mark, 0-based exclusive.
                  • hl_group : name of the highlight group used to highlight
                    this mark.
                  • hl_eol : when true, for a multiline highlight covering the
                    EOL of a line, continue the highlight for the rest of the
                    screen line (just like for diff and cursorline highlight).
                  • virt_text : virtual text to link to this mark. A list of
                    `[text, highlight]` tuples, each representing a text chunk
                    with specified highlight. `highlight` element can either
                    be a single highlight group, or an array of multiple
                    highlight groups that will be stacked (highest priority
                    last). A highlight group can be supplied either as a
                    string or as an integer, the latter which can be obtained
                    using |nvim_get_hl_id_by_name()|.
                  • virt_text_pos : position of virtual text. Possible values:
                    • "eol": right after eol character (default).
                    • "overlay": display over the specified column, without
                      shifting the underlying text.
                    • "right_align": display right aligned in the window.
                    • "inline": display at the specified column, and shift the
                      buffer text to the right as needed.
                  • virt_text_win_col : position the virtual text at a fixed
                    window column (starting from the first text column of the
                    screen line) instead of "virt_text_pos".
                  • virt_text_hide : hide the virtual text when the background
                    text is selected or hidden because of scrolling with
                    'nowrap' or 'smoothscroll'. Currently only affects
                    "overlay" virt_text.
                  • virt_text_repeat_linebreak : repeat the virtual text on
                    wrapped lines.
                  • hl_mode : control how highlights are combined with the
                    highlights of the text. Currently only affects virt_text
                    highlights, but might affect `hl_group` in later versions.
                    • "replace": only show the virt_text color. This is the
                      default.
                    • "combine": combine with background text color.
                    • "blend": blend with background text color. Not supported
                      for "inline" virt_text.
                  • virt_lines : virtual lines to add next to this mark This
                    should be an array over lines, where each line in turn is
                    an array over `[text, highlight]` tuples. In general,
                    buffer and window options do not affect the display of the
                    text. In particular 'wrap' and 'linebreak' options do not
                    take effect, so the number of extra screen lines will
                    always match the size of the array. However the 'tabstop'
                    buffer option is still used for hard tabs. By default
                    lines are placed below the buffer line containing the
                    mark.
                  • virt_lines_above: place virtual lines above instead.
                  • virt_lines_leftcol: Place extmarks in the leftmost column
                    of the window, bypassing sign and number columns.
                  • ephemeral : for use with |nvim_set_decoration_provider()|
                    callbacks. The mark will only be used for the current
                    redraw cycle, and not be permantently stored in the
                    buffer.
                  • right_gravity : boolean that indicates the direction the
                    extmark will be shifted in when new text is inserted (true
                    for right, false for left). Defaults to true.
                  • end_right_gravity : boolean that indicates the direction
                    the extmark end position (if it exists) will be shifted in
                    when new text is inserted (true for right, false for
                    left). Defaults to false.
                  • undo_restore : Restore the exact position of the mark if
                    text around the mark was deleted and then restored by
                    undo. Defaults to true.
                  • invalidate : boolean that indicates whether to hide the
                    extmark if the entirety of its range is deleted. For
                    hidden marks, an "invalid" key is added to the "details"
                    array of |nvim_buf_get_extmarks()| and family. If
                    "undo_restore" is false, the extmark is deleted instead.
                  • priority: a priority value for the highlight group, sign
                    attribute or virtual text. For virtual text, item with
                    highest priority is drawn last. For example treesitter
                    highlighting uses a value of 100.
                  • strict: boolean that indicates extmark should not be
                    placed if the line or column value is past the end of the
                    buffer or end of the line respectively. Defaults to true.
                  • sign_text: string of length 1-2 used to display in the
                    sign column.
                  • sign_hl_group: name of the highlight group used to
                    highlight the sign column text.
                  • number_hl_group: name of the highlight group used to
                    highlight the number column.
                  • line_hl_group: name of the highlight group used to
                    highlight the whole line.
                  • cursorline_hl_group: name of the highlight group used to
                    highlight the sign column text when the cursor is on the
                    same line as the mark and 'cursorline' is enabled.
                  • conceal: string which should be either empty or a single
                    character. Enable concealing similar to |:syn-conceal|.
                    When a character is supplied it is used as |:syn-cchar|.
                    "hl_group" is used as highlight for the cchar if provided,
                    otherwise it defaults to |hl-Conceal|.
                  • spell: boolean indicating that spell checking should be
                    performed within this extmark
                  • ui_watched: boolean that indicates the mark should be
                    drawn by a UI. When set, the UI will receive win_extmark
                    events. Note: the mark is positioned by virt_text
                    attributes. Can be used together with virt_text.
                  • url: A URL to associate with this extmark. In the TUI, the
                    OSC 8 control sequence is used to generate a clickable
                    hyperlink to this URL.

    Return: ~
        Id of the created/updated extmark

nvim_create_namespace({name})                        *nvim_create_namespace()*
    Creates a new namespace or gets an existing one.               *namespace*

    Namespaces are used for buffer highlights and virtual text, see
    |nvim_buf_add_highlight()| and |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|.

    Namespaces can be named or anonymous. If `name` matches an existing
    namespace, the associated id is returned. If `name` is an empty string a
    new, anonymous namespace is created.

    Parameters: ~
      • {name}  Namespace name or empty string

    Return: ~
        Namespace id

nvim_get_namespaces()                                  *nvim_get_namespaces()*
    Gets existing, non-anonymous |namespace|s.

    Return: ~
        dict that maps from names to namespace ids.

                                              *nvim_set_decoration_provider()*
nvim_set_decoration_provider({ns_id}, {opts})
    Set or change decoration provider for a |namespace|

    This is a very general purpose interface for having Lua callbacks being
    triggered during the redraw code.

    The expected usage is to set |extmarks| for the currently redrawn buffer.
    |nvim_buf_set_extmark()| can be called to add marks on a per-window or
    per-lines basis. Use the `ephemeral` key to only use the mark for the
    current screen redraw (the callback will be called again for the next
    redraw).

    Note: this function should not be called often. Rather, the callbacks
    themselves can be used to throttle unneeded callbacks. the `on_start`
    callback can return `false` to disable the provider until the next redraw.
    Similarly, return `false` in `on_win` will skip the `on_line` calls for
    that window (but any extmarks set in `on_win` will still be used). A
    plugin managing multiple sources of decoration should ideally only set one
    provider, and merge the sources internally. You can use multiple `ns_id`
    for the extmarks set/modified inside the callback anyway.

    Note: doing anything other than setting extmarks is considered
    experimental. Doing things like changing options are not explicitly
    forbidden, but is likely to have unexpected consequences (such as 100% CPU
    consumption). Doing `vim.rpcnotify` should be OK, but `vim.rpcrequest` is
    quite dubious for the moment.

    Note: It is not allowed to remove or update extmarks in `on_line`
    callbacks.

    Set highlight namespace for a window. This will use highlights defined
    with |nvim_set_hl()| for this namespace, but fall back to global
    highlights (ns=0) when missing.

    This takes precedence over the 'winhighlight' option.

    Parameters: ~

      • {width}   Width as a count of columns

nvim_win_text_height({window}, {opts})                *nvim_win_text_height()*
    Computes the number of screen lines occupied by a range of text in a given
    window. Works for off-screen text and takes folds into account.

    Diff filler or virtual lines above a line are counted as a part of that
    line, unless the line is on "start_row" and "start_vcol" is specified.

    Diff filler or virtual lines below the last buffer line are counted in the
    result when "end_row" is omitted.

    Line indexing is similar to |nvim_buf_get_text()|.

    Parameters: ~
      • {window}  Window handle, or 0 for current window.
      • {opts}    Optional parameters:
                  • start_row: Starting line index, 0-based inclusive. When
                    omitted start at the very top.
                  • end_row: Ending line index, 0-based inclusive. When

                  • start_vcol: Starting virtual column index on "start_row",
                    0-based inclusive, rounded down to full screen lines. When
                    omitted include the whole line.
                  • end_vcol: Ending virtual column index on "end_row",
                    0-based exclusive, rounded up to full screen lines. When
                    omitted include the whole line.

    Return: ~
        Dictionary containing text height information, with these keys:
        • all: The total number of screen lines occupied by the range.
        • fill: The number of diff filler or virtual lines among them.

    See also: ~
      • |virtcol()| for text width.


==============================================================================
Win_config Functions                                          *api-win_config*

nvim_open_win({buffer}, {enter}, {config})                   *nvim_open_win()*
    Opens a new split window, or a floating window if `relative` is specified,
    or an external window (managed by the UI) if `external` is specified.

    Floats are windows that are drawn above the split layout, at some anchor
    position in some other window. Floats can be drawn internally or by
    external GUI with the |ui-multigrid| extension. External windows are only
    supported with multigrid GUIs, and are displayed as separate top-level
    windows.

    For a general overview of floats, see |api-floatwin|.

    The `width` and `height` of the new window must be specified when opening
    a floating window, but are optional for normal windows.

    If `relative` and `external` are omitted, a normal "split" window is
    created. The `win` property determines which window will be split. If no
    `win` is provided or `win == 0`, a window will be created adjacent to the
    current window. If -1 is provided, a top-level split will be created.
    `vertical` and `split` are only valid for normal windows, and are used to
    control split direction. For `vertical`, the exact direction is determined
    by |'splitright'| and |'splitbelow'|. Split windows cannot have
    `bufpos`/`row`/`col`/`border`/`title`/`footer` properties.

    With relative=editor (row=0,col=0) refers to the top-left corner of the
    screen-grid and (row=Lines-1,col=Columns-1) refers to the bottom-right
    corner. Fractional values are allowed, but the builtin implementation
    (used by non-multigrid UIs) will always round down to nearest integer.

    Out-of-bounds values, and configurations that make the float not fit
    inside the main editor, are allowed. The builtin implementation truncates
    values so floats are fully within the main screen grid. External GUIs
    could let floats hover outside of the main window like a tooltip, but this
    should not be used to specify arbitrary WM screen positions.

    Example (Lua): window-relative float >lua
        vim.api.nvim_open_win(0, false,
          {relative='win', row=3, col=3, width=12, height=3})

    Example (Lua): buffer-relative float (travels as buffer is scrolled) >lua
        vim.api.nvim_open_win(0, false,
          {relative='win', width=12, height=3, bufpos={100,10}})
<

    Example (Lua): vertical split left of the current window >lua
        vim.api.nvim_open_win(0, false, {
          split = 'left',

    Parameters: ~
      • {buffer}  Buffer to display, or 0 for current buffer
      • {enter}   Enter the window (make it the current window)
      • {config}  Map defining the window configuration. Keys:
                  • relative: Sets the window layout to "floating", placed at
                    (row,col) coordinates relative to:
                    • "editor" The global editor grid
                    • "win" Window given by the `win` field, or current
                      window.
                    • "cursor" Cursor position in current window.
                    • "mouse" Mouse position
                  • win: |window-ID| window to split, or relative window when
                    creating a float (relative="win").
                  • anchor: Decides which corner of the float to place at
                    (row,col):
                    • "NW" northwest (default)
                    • "NE" northeast
                    • "SW" southwest
                    • "SE" southeast
                  • width: Window width (in character cells). Minimum of 1.

                  • bufpos: Places float relative to buffer text (only when
                    relative="win"). Takes a tuple of zero-indexed
                    `[line, column]`. `row` and `col` if given are applied
                    relative to this position, else they default to:
                    • `row=1` and `col=0` if `anchor` is "NW" or "NE"
                    • `row=0` and `col=0` if `anchor` is "SW" or "SE" (thus
                      like a tooltip near the buffer text).
                  • row: Row position in units of "screen cell height", may be
                    fractional.
                  • col: Column position in units of "screen cell width", may
                    be fractional.
                  • focusable: Enable focus by user actions (wincmds, mouse
                    events). Defaults to true. Non-focusable windows can be
                    entered by |nvim_set_current_win()|.
                  • external: GUI should display the window as an external
                    top-level window. Currently accepts no other positioning
                    configuration together with this.
                  • zindex: Stacking order. floats with higher `zindex` go on
                    top on floats with lower indices. Must be larger than
                    zero. The following screen elements have hard-coded
                    z-indices:
                    • 100: insert completion popupmenu
                    • 200: message scrollback

                      wildoptions+=pum) The default value for floats are 50.
                      In general, values below 100 are recommended, unless
                      there is a good reason to overshadow builtin elements.
                  • style: (optional) Configure the appearance of the window.
                    Currently only supports one value:
                    • "minimal" Nvim will display the window with many UI
                      options disabled. This is useful when displaying a
                      temporary float where the text should not be edited.

                      'cursorcolumn', 'foldcolumn', 'spell' and 'list'
                      options. 'signcolumn' is changed to `auto` and
                      'colorcolumn' is cleared. 'statuscolumn' is changed to
                      empty. The end-of-buffer region is hidden by setting
                      `eob` flag of 'fillchars' to a space char, and clearing
                      the |hl-EndOfBuffer| region in 'winhighlight'.
                  • border: Style of (optional) window border. This can either
                    be a string or an array. The string values are
                    • "none": No border (default).
                    • "single": A single line box.
                    • "double": A double line box.
                    • "rounded": Like "single", but with rounded corners
                      ("╭" etc.).
                    • "solid": Adds padding by a single whitespace cell.
                    • "shadow": A drop shadow effect by blending with the
                      background.
                    • If it is an array, it should have a length of eight or
                      any divisor of eight. The array will specify the eight
                      chars building up the border in a clockwise fashion
                      starting with the top-left corner. As an example, the
                      double box style could be specified as: >
                      [ "╔", "═" ,"╗", "║", "╝", "═", "╚", "║" ].
<
                      If the number of chars are less than eight, they will be
                      repeated. Thus an ASCII border could be specified as >
                      [ "/", "-", \"\\\\\", "|" ],
<
                      or all chars the same as >
                      [ "x" ].
<
                    An empty string can be used to turn off a specific border,
                    for instance, >
                     [ "", "", "", ">", "", "", "", "<" ]
<
                    will only make vertical borders but not horizontal ones.
                    By default, `FloatBorder` highlight is used, which links
                    to `WinSeparator` when not defined. It could also be
                    specified by character: >
                     [ ["+", "MyCorner"], ["x", "MyBorder"] ].
<
                  • title: Title (optional) in window border, string or list.
                    List should consist of `[text, highlight]` tuples. If
                    string, or a tuple lacks a highlight, the default
                    highlight group is `FloatTitle`.
                  • title_pos: Title position. Must be set with `title`
                    option. Value can be one of "left", "center", or "right".
                    Default is `"left"`.
                  • footer: Footer (optional) in window border, string or
                    list. List should consist of `[text, highlight]` tuples.
                    If string, or a tuple lacks a highlight, the default
                    highlight group is `FloatFooter`.
                  • footer_pos: Footer position. Must be set with `footer`
                    option. Value can be one of "left", "center", or "right".
                    Default is `"left"`.
                  • noautocmd: If true then all autocommands are blocked for
                    the duration of the call.
                  • fixed: If true when anchor is NW or SW, the float window
                    would be kept fixed even if the window would be truncated.
                  • hide: If true the floating window will be hidden.
                  • vertical: Split vertically |:vertical|.
                  • split: Split direction: "left", "right", "above", "below".

                      `test.py` will not match the pattern.
                  • defaults to clearing all patterns.

nvim_create_autocmd({event}, {opts})                   *nvim_create_autocmd()*
    Creates an |autocommand| event handler, defined by `callback` (Lua
    function or Vimscript function name string) or `command` (Ex command
    string).

    Example using Lua callback: >lua
        vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufEnter", "BufWinEnter"}, {
          pattern = {"*.c", "*.h"},
          callback = function(ev)
            print(string.format('event fired: %s', vim.inspect(ev)))
          end
        })
<

    Example using an Ex command as the handler: >lua
        vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufEnter", "BufWinEnter"}, {
          pattern = {"*.c", "*.h"},
          command = "echo 'Entering a C or C++ file'",
        })
<

    Note: `pattern` is NOT automatically expanded (unlike with |:autocmd|),
    thus names like "$HOME" and "~" must be expanded explicitly: >lua
        pattern = vim.fn.expand("~") .. "/some/path/*.py"

                 • callback (function|string) optional: Lua function (or
                   Vimscript function name, if string) called when the
                   event(s) is triggered. Lua callback can return a truthy
                   value (not `false` or `nil`) to delete the autocommand.
                   Receives one argument, a table with these keys:

        degrade to the smallest client. E.g. if client A requests 80x40 but
        client B requests 200x100, the global screen has size 80x40.

    Parameters: ~
      • {width}    Requested screen columns
      • {height}   Requested screen rows
      • {options}  |ui-option| map

nvim_ui_detach()                                            *nvim_ui_detach()*
    Deactivates UI events on the channel.

    Removes the client from the list of UIs. |nvim_list_uis()|

                                                    *nvim_ui_pum_set_bounds()*
nvim_ui_pum_set_bounds({width}, {height}, {row}, {col})
    Tells Nvim the geometry of the popupmenu, to align floating windows with
    an external popup menu.

    Note that this method is not to be confused with
    |nvim_ui_pum_set_height()|, which sets the number of visible items in the
    popup menu, while this function sets the bounding box of the popup menu,
    including visual elements such as borders and sliders. Floats need not use
    the same font size, nor be anchored to exact grid corners, so one can set
    floating-point numbers to the popup menu geometry.

    Attributes: ~
        |RPC| only

    Parameters: ~
      • {width}   Popupmenu width.
      • {height}  Popupmenu height.
      • {row}     Popupmenu row.
      • {col}     Popupmenu height.

nvim_ui_pum_set_height({height})                    *nvim_ui_pum_set_height()*
    Tells Nvim the number of elements displaying in the popupmenu, to decide
    <PageUp> and <PageDown> movement.

    Attributes: ~
        |RPC| only

    Parameters: ~
      • {height}  Popupmenu height, must be greater than zero.

nvim_ui_set_focus({gained})                              *nvim_ui_set_focus()*
    Tells the nvim server if focus was gained or lost by the GUI

    Attributes: ~
        |RPC| only

nvim_ui_set_option({name}, {value})                     *nvim_ui_set_option()*

nvim_ui_term_event({event}, {value})                    *nvim_ui_term_event()*
    Tells Nvim when a terminal event has occurred

    The following terminal events are supported:
    • "termresponse": The terminal sent an OSC or DCS response sequence to
      Nvim. The payload is the received response. Sets |v:termresponse| and
      fires |TermResponse|.

    Attributes: ~
        |RPC| only

    Parameters: ~
      • {event}  Event name
      • {value}  Event payload

nvim_ui_try_resize({width}, {height})                   *nvim_ui_try_resize()*

    Attributes: ~
        |RPC| only

                                                   *nvim_ui_try_resize_grid()*
nvim_ui_try_resize_grid({grid}, {width}, {height})
    Tell Nvim to resize a grid. Triggers a grid_resize event with the
    requested grid size or the maximum size if it exceeds size limits.

    On invalid grid handle, fails with error.

    Attributes: ~
        |RPC| only

    Parameters: ~
      • {grid}    The handle of the grid to be changed.
      • {width}   The new requested width.
      • {height}  The new requested height.
