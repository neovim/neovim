Nvim API							   *API* *api*

Nvim exposes a powerful API that can be used by plugins and external processes
via |RPC|, |Lua| and VimL (|eval-api|).

Applications can also embed libnvim to work with the C API directly.

                                      Type |gO| to see the table of contents.

==============================================================================
API Types							   *api-types*

The Nvim C API defines custom types for all function parameters. Some are just
typedefs around C99 standard types, others are Nvim-defined data structures.

  Boolean				-> bool
  Integer (signed 64-bit integer)	-> int64_t
  Float (IEEE 754 double precision)	-> double
  String				-> {char* data, size_t size} struct
  Array
  Dictionary
  Object

The following handle types are defined as integer typedefs, but are
discriminated as separate types in an Object:

  Buffer				-> enum value kObjectTypeBuffer
  Window				-> enum value kObjectTypeWindow
  Tabpage				-> enum value kObjectTypeTabpage

==============================================================================
API metadata							 *api-metadata*

Nvim exposes API metadata as a Dictionary. Some items are described below:

version			Nvim version, API level/compatibility
version.api_level	Current API level
version.api_compatible	API is backwards-compatible with this level
version.api_prerelease	Declares the current API level as unstable >
			(version.api_prerelease && fn.since == version.api_level)
functions		API function signatures
ui_events		UI event signatures |ui|
ui_options		Supported |ui-options|
{fn}.since		API level where function {fn} was introduced
{fn}.deprecated_since	API level where function {fn} was deprecated
types			Custom handle types defined by Nvim
error_types		Possible error types returned by API functions

External programs ("clients") can use the metadata to discover the |rpc-api|.

==============================================================================
API contract                                                     *api-contract*

The Nvim API is composed of functions and events.

- Clients call functions like those described at |api-global|.
- Clients can subscribe to |ui-events|, |api-buffer-updates|, etc.
- API function names are prefixed with "nvim_".
- API event names are prefixed with "nvim_" and suffixed with "_event".

As Nvim evolves the API may change in compliance with this CONTRACT:

- New functions and events may be added.
  - Any such extensions are OPTIONAL: old clients may ignore them.
- Function signatures will NOT CHANGE (after release).
  - Functions introduced in the development (unreleased) version MAY CHANGE.
    (Clients can dynamically check `api_prerelease`, etc. |api-metadata|)
- Event parameters will not be removed or reordered (after release).
- Events may be EXTENDED: new parameters may be added.
- New items may be ADDED to map/list parameters/results of functions and
  events.
  - Any such new items are OPTIONAL: old clients may ignore them.
  - Existing items will not be removed (after release).
- Deprecated functions will not be removed until Nvim version 2.0

==============================================================================
Buffer update events					*api-buffer-updates*

API clients can "attach" to Nvim buffers to subscribe to buffer update events.
This is similar to |TextChanged| but more powerful and granular.

Call |nvim_buf_attach()| to receive these events on the channel:

                                                        *nvim_buf_lines_event*
nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, {firstline}, {lastline}, {linedata}, {more}]

  When the buffer text between {firstline} and {lastline} (end-exclusive,
  zero-indexed) were changed to the new text in the {linedata} list. The
  granularity is a line, i.e. if a single character is changed in the editor,
  the entire line is sent.

  When {changedtick} is |v:null| this means the screen lines (display) changed
  but not the buffer contents. {linedata} contains the changed screen lines.
  This happens when 'inccommand' shows a buffer preview.

  Properties:~
    {buf} API buffer handle (buffer number)

    {changedtick} value of |b:changedtick| for the buffer. If you send an API
    command back to nvim you can check the value of |b:changedtick| as part of
    your request to ensure that no other changes have been made.

    {firstline} integer line number of the first line that was replaced.
    Zero-indexed: if line 1 was replaced then {firstline} will be 0, not 1.
    {firstline} is always less than or equal to the number of lines that were
    in the buffer before the lines were replaced.

    {lastline} integer line number of the first line that was not replaced
    (i.e. the range {firstline}, {lastline} is end-exclusive).
    Zero-indexed: if line numbers 2 to 5 were replaced, this will be 5 instead
    of 6. {lastline} is always be less than or equal to the number of lines
    that were in the buffer before the lines were replaced. {lastline} will be
    -1 if the event is part of the initial update after attaching.

    {linedata} list of strings containing the contents of the new buffer
    lines. Newline characters are omitted; empty lines are sent as empty
    strings.

    {more} boolean, true for a "multipart" change notification: the current
    change was chunked into multiple |nvim_buf_lines_event| notifications
    (e.g. because it was too big).

nvim_buf_changedtick_event[{buf}, {changedtick}]  *nvim_buf_changedtick_event*

  When |b:changedtick| was incremented but no text was changed. Relevant for
  undo/redo.

  Properties:~
    {buf} API buffer handle (buffer number)
    {changedtick} new value of |b:changedtick| for the buffer

nvim_buf_detach_event[{buf}]                           *nvim_buf_detach_event*

  When buffer is detached (i.e. updates are disabled). Triggered explicitly by
  |nvim_buf_detach()| or implicitly in these cases:
  - Buffer was |abandon|ed and 'hidden' is not set.
  - Buffer was reloaded, e.g. with |:edit| or an external change triggered
    |:checktime| or 'autoread'.
  - Generally: whenever the buffer contents are unloaded from memory.

EXAMPLE ~

Calling |nvim_buf_attach()| with send_buffer=true on an empty buffer, emits: >
  nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 0, 0, [""], v:false]

User adds two lines to the buffer, emits: >
  nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 0, 0, ["line1", "line2"], v:false]

User moves to a line containing the text "Hello world" and inserts "!", emits: >
  nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, {linenr}, {linenr} + 1,
                       ["Hello world!"], v:false]

User moves to line 3 and deletes 20 lines using "20dd", emits: >
  nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 2, 22, [], v:false]

User selects lines 3-5 using |linewise-visual| mode and then types "p" to
paste a block of 6 lines, emits: >
  nvim_buf_lines_event[{buf}, {changedtick}, 2, 5,
    ['pasted line 1', 'pasted line 2', 'pasted line 3', 'pasted line 4',
     'pasted line 5', 'pasted line 6'],
    v:false
  ]

User reloads the buffer with ":edit", emits: >
  nvim_buf_detach_event[{buf}]

==============================================================================
Buffer highlighting					       *api-highlights*

Nvim allows plugins to add position-based highlights to buffers. This is
similar to |matchaddpos()| but with some key differences. The added highlights
are associated with a buffer and adapts to line insertions and deletions,
similar to signs. It is also possible to manage a set of highlights as a group
and delete or replace all at once.

The intended use case are linter or semantic highlighter plugins that monitor
a buffer for changes, and in the background compute highlights to the buffer.
Another use case are plugins that show output in an append-only buffer, and
want to add highlights to the outputs. Highlight data cannot be preserved
on writing and loading a buffer to file, nor in undo/redo cycles.

Highlights are registered using the |nvim_buf_add_highlight()| function. If an
external highlighter plugin wants to add many highlights in a batch,
performance can be improved by calling |nvim_buf_add_highlight()| as an
asynchronous notification, after first (synchronously) reqesting a source id.
Example using the Nvim python-client:
>
    src = vim.new_highlight_source()

    buf = vim.current.buffer
    for i in range(5):
        buf.add_highlight("String",i,0,-1,src_id=src)

    # some time later

    buf.clear_highlight(src)
<
If the highlights don't need to be deleted or updated, just pass -1 as
src_id (this is the default in python). Use |nvim_buf_clear_highlight()| to
clear highlights from a specific source, in a specific line range or the
entire buffer by passing in the line range 0, -1 (the latter is the default in
python as used above).

An example of calling the api from vimscript: >

    call nvim_buf_set_lines(0, 0, 0, v:true, ["test text"])
    let src = nvim_buf_add_highlight(0, 0, "String", 1, 0, 4)
    call nvim_buf_add_highlight(0, src, "Identifier", 0, 5, -1)

    " later
    call nvim_buf_clear_highlight(0, src, 0, -1)
>

nvim_command({command})                                       *nvim_command()*
                Executes an ex-command.

                On execution error: fails with VimL error, does not update
                v:errmsg.

                Parameters: ~
                    {command}  Ex-command string

nvim_get_hl_by_name({name}, {rgb})                     *nvim_get_hl_by_name()*
                Gets a highlight definition by name.

                Parameters: ~

                    Highlight definition map

nvim_get_hl_by_id({hl_id}, {rgb})                        *nvim_get_hl_by_id()*
                Gets a highlight definition by id. |hlID()|

                Parameters: ~

                    {rgb}    Export RGB colors

                Return: ~
                    Highlight definition map

nvim_feedkeys({keys}, {mode}, {escape_csi})                  *nvim_feedkeys()*
                Sends input-keys to Nvim, subject to various quirks controlled
                by `mode` flags. This is a blocking call, unlike
                |nvim_input()|.

                On execution error: does not fail, but updates v:errmsg.

                Parameters: ~
                    {keys}        to be typed
                    {mode}        behavior flags, see |feedkeys()|
                    {escape_csi}  If true, escape K_SPECIAL/CSI bytes in
                                  `keys`

nvim_input({keys})                                              *nvim_input()*
                Queues raw user-input. Unlike |nvim_feedkeys()|, this uses a
                low-level input buffer and the call is non-blocking (input is
                processed asynchronously by the eventloop).

                On execution error: does not fail, but updates v:errmsg.

                Note:
                    |keycodes| like <CR> are translated, so "<" is special. To
                    input a literal "<", send <LT>.

                Attributes: ~
                    {async}

                Parameters: ~
                    {keys}  to be typed

                Return: ~
                    Number of bytes actually written (can be fewer than
                    requested if the buffer becomes full).

                                                    *nvim_replace_termcodes()*
nvim_replace_termcodes({str}, {from_part}, {do_lt}, {special})
                Replaces terminal codes and |keycodes| (<CR>, <Esc>, ...) in a
                string with the internal representation.

                Parameters: ~
                    {str}        String to be converted.
                    {from_part}  Legacy Vim parameter. Usually true.
                    {do_lt}      Also translate <lt>. Ignored if `special` is
                                 false.
                    {special}    Replace |keycodes|, e.g. <CR> becomes a "\n"
                                 char.

                v:errmsg.

                Parameters: ~
                    {command}  Ex-command string

                but subsequent calls will remove earlier info, which should be
                resent if it is still valid. (This could happen if a library

                    {methods}     Builtin methods in the client. For a host,
                                  this does not include plugin methods which
                                  will be discovered later. The key should be
                                  the method name, the values are dicts with

                                  and maximum inclusive. Further keys might be
                                  added in later versions of nvim and unknown
                                  keys are thus ignored. Clients must only use
                                  keys defined in this or later versions of
                                  nvim!

                                  of client (for instance github repository)
                                  "license" Informal description of the

                                  preferably small logo or icon. .png or .svg
                                  format is preferred.

                Get information about a channel.

                Return: ~
                    a Dictionary, describing a channel with the following
                    keys:   "stream" the stream underlying the channel
                    "stdio" stdin and stdout of this Nvim instance  "stderr"

This is currently the case when using winpty on windows.  "buffer" buffer with connected |terminal| instance (optional)  "client" information about the client on the other end of the RPC channel, if it has added it using |nvim_set_client_info()|. (optional)

nvim_list_chans()                                          *nvim_list_chans()*

                Calls many API methods atomically.

                This has two main usages:
                  To perform several requests from an async context atomically, i.e. without interleaving redraws, RPC requests from other clients, or user interactions (however API methods may trigger autocommands or event processing which have such side-effects, e.g. |:sleep| may wake timers).  To minimize RPC overhead (roundtrips) of a sequence of many requests.

                Parameters: ~
                    {calls}  an array of calls, where each call is described
                             by an array with two elements: the request name,
                             and an array of arguments.

                Return: ~
                    an array with two elements. The first is an array of
                    return values. The second is NIL if all calls succeeded.
                    If a call resulted in an error, it is a three-element
                    array with the zero-based index of the call which resulted
                    in an error, the error type and the error message. If an
                    error occurred, the values from all preceding calls will
                    still be returned.

                                 (determines whether they will stop parsing
                                 process or be recognized as an
                                 operator/space, though also yielding an
                                 error). - "l" when needing to start parsing
                                 with lvalues for ":let" or ":for". Common

Buffer Functions                                                  *api-buffer*

Unloaded Buffers:~

Buffers may be unloaded by the |:bunload| command or the
buffer's |'bufhidden'| option. When a buffer is unloaded its
file contents are freed from memory and vim cannot operate on
the buffer lines until it is reloaded (usually by opening the
buffer again in a new window). API methods such as
|nvim_buf_get_lines()| and |nvim_buf_line_count()| will be
affected.

You can use |nvim_buf_is_loaded()| or |nvim_buf_line_count()|
to check whether a buffer is loaded.

nvim_buf_line_count({buffer})                          *nvim_buf_line_count()*
                Gets the buffer line count

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle

                Return: ~
                    Line count, or 0 for unloaded buffer. |api-buffer|

nvim_buf_attach({buffer}, {send_buffer}, {opts})           *nvim_buf_attach()*
                Activate updates from this buffer to the current channel.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}       The buffer handle
                    {send_buffer}  Set to true if the initial notification
                                   should contain the whole buffer. If so, the
                                   first notification will be a
                                   `nvim_buf_lines_event`. Otherwise, the
                                   first notification will be a
                                   `nvim_buf_changedtick_event`
                    {opts}         Optional parameters. Currently not used.

                Return: ~
                    False when updates couldn't be enabled because the buffer
                    isn't loaded or optscontained an invalid key; otherwise
                    True.

nvim_buf_detach({buffer})                                  *nvim_buf_detach()*
                Deactivate updates from this buffer to the current channel.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  The buffer handle

                Return: ~
                    False when updates couldn't be disabled because the buffer
                    isn't loaded; otherwise True.

                                                        *nvim_buf_get_lines()*
nvim_buf_get_lines({buffer}, {start}, {end}, {strict_indexing})
                Gets a line-range from the buffer.

                Indexing is zero-based, end-exclusive. Negative indices are
                interpreted as length+1+index: -1 refers to the index past the
                end. So to get the last element use start=-2 and end=-1.

                Out-of-bounds indices are clamped to the nearest valid value,
                unless `strict_indexing` is set.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}           Buffer handle
                    {start}            First line index
                    {end}              Last line index (exclusive)
                    {strict_indexing}  Whether out-of-bounds should be an
                                       error.

                Return: ~
                    Array of lines, or empty array for unloaded buffer.

                                                        *nvim_buf_set_lines()*
nvim_buf_set_lines({buffer}, {start}, {end}, {strict_indexing},
                   {replacement})
                Sets (replaces) a line-range in the buffer.

                Indexing is zero-based, end-exclusive. Negative indices are
                interpreted as length+1+index: -1 refers to the index past the
                end. So to change or delete the last element use start=-2 and
                end=-1.

                To insert lines at a given index, set `start` and `end` to the
                same index. To delete a range of lines, set `replacement` to
                an empty array.

                Out-of-bounds indices are clamped to the nearest valid value,
                unless `strict_indexing` is set.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}           Buffer handle
                    {start}            First line index
                    {end}              Last line index (exclusive)
                    {strict_indexing}  Whether out-of-bounds should be an
                                       error.
                    {replacement}      Array of lines to use as replacement

nvim_buf_get_offset({buffer}, {index})                 *nvim_buf_get_offset()*
                Returns the byte offset for a line.

                Line 1 (index=0) has offset 0. UTF-8 bytes are counted. EOL is
                one byte. 'fileformat' and 'fileencoding' are ignored. The
                line index just after the last line gives the total byte-count
                of the buffer. A final EOL byte is counted if it would be
                written, see 'eol'.

                Unlike |line2byte()|, throws error for out-of-bounds indexing.
                Returns -1 for unloaded buffer.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle
                    {index}   Line index

                Note:
                    Even if a buffer is valid it may have been unloaded. See
                    |api-buffer| for more info about unloaded buffers.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle

                    (row, col) tuple

                                                    *nvim_buf_add_highlight()*
nvim_buf_add_highlight({buffer}, {src_id}, {hl_group}, {line},
                       {col_start}, {col_end})
                Adds a highlight to buffer.

                Useful for plugins that dynamically generate highlights to a
                buffer (like a semantic highlighter or linter). The function
                adds a single highlight to a buffer. Unlike matchaddpos()
                highlights follow changes to line numbering (as lines are
                inserted/removed above the highlighted line), like signs and
                marks do.

                `src_id` is useful for batch deletion/updating of a set of
                highlights. When called with `src_id = 0`, an unique source id
                is generated and returned. Successive calls can pass that
                `src_id` to associate new highlights with the same source
                group. All highlights in the same group can be cleared with
                `nvim_buf_clear_highlight`. If the highlight never will be
                manually deleted, pass `src_id = -1`.

                If `hl_group` is the empty string no highlight is added, but a
                new `src_id` is still returned. This is useful for an external
                plugin to synchrounously request an unique `src_id` at
                initialization, and later asynchronously add and clear
                highlights in response to buffer changes.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}     Buffer handle
                    {src_id}     Source group to use or 0 to use a new group,
                                 or -1 for ungrouped highlight
                    {hl_group}   Name of the highlight group to use
                    {line}       Line to highlight (zero-indexed)
                    {col_start}  Start of (byte-indexed) column range to
                                 highlight
                    {col_end}    End of (byte-indexed) column range to
                                 highlight, or -1 to highlight to end of line

                Return: ~
                    The src_id that was used

                                                  *nvim_buf_clear_highlight()*
nvim_buf_clear_highlight({buffer}, {src_id}, {line_start}, {line_end})
                Clears highlights and virtual text from a given source id and
                range of lines

                To clear a source group in the entire buffer, pass in 0 and -1
                to line_start and line_end respectively.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}      Buffer handle
                    {src_id}      Highlight source group to clear, or -1 to
                                  clear all.
                    {line_start}  Start of range of lines to clear
                    {line_end}    End of range of lines to clear (exclusive)
                                  or -1 to clear to end of file.

                                                 *nvim_buf_set_virtual_text()*
nvim_buf_set_virtual_text({buffer}, {src_id}, {line}, {chunks},
                          {opts})
                Set the virtual text (annotation) for a buffer line.

                By default (and currently the only option) the text will be
                placed after the buffer text. Virtual text will never cause
                reflow, rather virtual text will be truncated at the end of
                the screen line. The virtual text will begin after one cell to
                the right of the ordinary text, this will contain the |lcs-
                eol| char if set, otherwise just be a space.

                The same src_id can be used for both virtual text and
                highlights added by nvim_buf_add_highlight. Virtual text is
                cleared using nvim_buf_clear_highlight.

                Parameters: ~
                    {buffer}  Buffer handle
                    {src_id}  Source group to use or 0 to use a new group, or
                              -1 for a ungrouped annotation
                    {line}    Line to annotate with virtual text (zero-
                              indexed)
                    {chunks}  A list of [text, hl_group] arrays, each
                              representing a text chunk with specified
                              highlight. `hl_group` element can be omitted for
                              no highlight.
                    {opts}    Optional parameters. Currently not used.

                Return: ~
                    The src_id that was used
