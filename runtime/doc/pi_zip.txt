==============================================================================
2. Usage						*zip-usage* *zip-manual*

   When one edits a *.zip file, this plugin will handle displaying a
   contents page.  Select a file to edit by moving the cursor atop
   the desired file, then hit the <return> key.  After editing, one may
   also write to the file.  Currently, one may not make a new file in
   zip archives via the plugin.

   COMMANDS~
								*zip-x*
   x : extract a listed file when the cursor is atop it

   OPTIONS~

							*g:zip_nomax*

   If this variable exists and is true, the file window will not be
   automatically maximized when opened.

							*g:zip_shq*
   Different operating systems may use one or more shells to execute
   commands.  Zip will try to guess the correct quoting mechanism to
   allow spaces and whatnot in filenames; however, if it is incorrectly
   guessing the quote to use for your setup, you may use >
	g:zip_shq
<  which by default is a single quote under Unix (') and a double quote
   under Windows (").  If you'd rather have no quotes, simply set
   g:zip_shq to the empty string (let g:zip_shq= "") in your <.vimrc>.

							*g:zip_unzipcmd*
   Use this option to specify the program which does the duty of "unzip".
   It's used during browsing. By default: >
	let g:zip_unzipcmd= "unzip"
<
							*g:zip_zipcmd*
   Use this option to specify the program which does the duty of "zip".
   It's used during the writing (updating) of a file already in a zip
   file; by default: >
	let g:zip_zipcmd= "zip"
<
							*g:zip_extractcmd*
   This option specifies the program (and any options needed) used to
   extract a file from a zip archive.  By default, >
	let g:zip_extractcmd= g:zip_unzipcmd
<
   PREVENTING LOADING~

   If for some reason you do not wish to use vim to examine zipped files,
   you may put the following two variables into your <.vimrc> to prevent
   the zip plugin from loading: >

	let g:loaded_zipPlugin= 1
	let g:loaded_zip      = 1
<

==============================================================================
3. Additional Extensions					*zip-extension*

   Apparently there are a number of archivers which generate zip files that
   don't use the .zip extension (.jar, .xpi, etc).  To handle such files,
   place a line in your <.vimrc> file: >

	au BufReadCmd *.jar,*.xpi call zip#Browse(expand("<amatch>"))
<
   One can simply extend this line to accommodate additional extensions that
   should be treated as zip files.

   Alternatively, one may change *g:zipPlugin_ext* in one's .vimrc.
   Currently (11/30/15) it holds: >

	let g:zipPlugin_ext= '*.zip,*.jar,*.xpi,*.ja,*.war,*.ear,*.celzip,
       \ *.oxt,*.kmz,*.wsz,*.xap,*.docx,*.docm,*.dotx,*.dotm,*.potx,*.potm,
       \ *.ppsx,*.ppsm,*.pptx,*.pptm,*.ppam,*.sldx,*.thmx,*.xlam,*.xlsx,*.xlsm,
       \ *.xlsb,*.xltx,*.xltm,*.xlam,*.crtx,*.vdw,*.glox,*.gcsx,*.gqsx,*.epub'

4. History							*zip-history* {{{1
   v33 Dec 07, 2021 * *.xlam mentioned twice in zipPlugin
   v32 Oct 22, 2021 * to avoid an issue with a vim 8.2 patch, zipfile: has
		      been changed to zipfile:// . This often shows up
		      as zipfile:/// with zipped files that are root-based.
   v29 Apr 02, 2017 * (Klartext) reported that an encrypted zip file could
		      opened but the swapfile held unencrypted contents.
		      The solution is to edit the contents of a zip file
		      using the |:noswapfile| modifier.
   v28 Oct 08, 2014 * changed the sanity checks for executables to reflect
		      the command actually to be attempted in zip#Read()
		      and zip#Write()
		    * added the extraction of a file capability
       Nov 30, 2015 * added *.epub to the |g:zipPlugin_ext| list
       Sep 13, 2016 * added *.apk to the |g:zipPlugin_ext| list and
		      sorted the suffices.
   v27 Jul 02, 2013 * sanity check: zipfile must have "PK" as its first
		      two bytes.
		    * modified to allow zipfile: entries in quickfix lists
   v26 Nov 15, 2012 * (Jason Spiro) provided a lot of new extensions that
		      are synonyms for .zip
   v25 Jun 27, 2011 * using keepj with unzip -Z
		      (consistent with the -p variant)
		    * (Ben Staniford) now uses
			has("win32unix") && executable("cygpath")
		      before converting to cygwin-style paths
   v24 Jun 21, 2010 * (CÃ©dric Bosdonnat) unzip seems to need its filenames
		      fnameescape'd as well as shellquote'd
		    * (Motoya Kurotsu) inserted keepj before 0d to protect
		      jump list
   v17 May 09, 2008 * arno caught a security bug
   v15 Sep 07, 2007 * &shq now used if not the empty string for g:zip_shq
   v14 May 07, 2007 * using b:zipfile instead of w:zipfile to avoid problem
                      when editing alternate file to bring up a zipfile
   v10 May 02, 2006 * now using "redraw then echo" to show messages, instead
                      of "echo and prompt user"
		    * g:zip_shq provided to allow for quoting control for the
		      command being passed via :r! ... commands.
   v8 Apr 10, 2006 * Bram Moolenaar reported that he received an error message
                     due to "Pattern not found: ^.*\%0c"; this was caused by
		     stridx finding a Name... at the beginning of the line;
		     zip.vim tried 4,$s/^.*\%0c//, but that doesn't work.
		     Fixed.
   v7 Mar 22, 2006 * escaped some characters that can cause filename handling
                     problems.
   v6 Dec 21, 2005 * writing to files not in directories caused problems -
                     fixed (pointed out by Christian Robinson)
   v5 Nov 22, 2005 * report option workaround installed
   v3 Oct 18, 2005 * <amatch> used instead of <afile> in autocmds
   v2 Sep 16, 2005 * silenced some commands (avoiding hit-enter prompt)
                   * began testing under Windows; works thus far
		   * filetype detection fixed
      Nov 03, 2005 * handles writing zipfiles across a network using
                     netrw#NetWrite()
   v1 Sep 15, 2005 * Initial release, had browsing, reading, and writing
