2. Starting With Netrw					*netrw-start* {{{1

Netrw makes reading files, writing files, browsing over a network, and
local browsing easy!  First, make sure that you have plugins enabled, so
you'll need to have at least the following in your <.vimrc>:
(or see |netrw-activate|) >

	set nocp                    " 'compatible' is not set
	filetype plugin on          " plugins are enabled
<
(see |'cp'| and |:filetype-plugin-on|)

Netrw supports "transparent" editing of files on other machines using urls
(see |netrw-transparent|). As an example of this, let's assume you have an
account on some other machine; if you can use scp, try: >

	vim scp://hostname/path/to/file
<
Want to make ssh/scp easier to use? Check out |netrw-ssh-hack|!

So, what if you have ftp, not ssh/scp?  That's easy, too; try >

	vim ftp://hostname/path/to/file
<
Want to make ftp simpler to use?  See if your ftp supports a file called
<.netrc> -- typically it goes in your home directory, has read/write
permissions for only the user to read (ie. not group, world, other, etc),
and has lines resembling >

	machine HOSTNAME login USERID password "PASSWORD"
	machine HOSTNAME login USERID password "PASSWORD"
	...
	default          login USERID password "PASSWORD"
<
Windows' ftp doesn't support .netrc; however, one may have in one's .vimrc:  >

   let g:netrw_ftp_cmd= 'c:\Windows\System32\ftp -s:C:\Users\MyUserName\MACHINE'
<
Netrw will substitute the host's machine name for "MACHINE" from the URL it is
attempting to open, and so one may specify >
	userid
	password
for each site in a separate file: c:\Users\MyUserName\MachineName.

Now about browsing -- when you just want to look around before editing a
file.  For browsing on your current host, just "edit" a directory: >

	vim .
	vim /home/userid/path
<
For browsing on a remote host, "edit" a directory (but make sure that
the directory name is followed by a "/"): >

	vim scp://hostname/
	vim ftp://hostname/path/to/dir/
<
See |netrw-browse| for more!

There are more protocols supported by netrw than just scp and ftp, too: see the
next section, |netrw-externapp|, on how to use these external applications with
netrw and vim.

PREVENTING LOADING					*netrw-noload*

If you want to use plugins, but for some reason don't wish to use netrw, then
you need to avoid loading both the plugin and the autoload portions of netrw.
You may do so by placing the following two lines in your <.vimrc>: >

	:let g:loaded_netrw       = 1
	:let g:loaded_netrwPlugin = 1
<

==============================================================================
3. Netrw Reference					*netrw-ref* {{{1

   Netrw supports several protocols in addition to scp and ftp as mentioned
   in |netrw-start|.  These include dav, fetch, http,... well, just look
   at the list in |netrw-externapp|.  Each protocol is associated with a
   variable which holds the default command supporting that protocol.

EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS AND PROTOCOLS			*netrw-externapp* {{{2

	Protocol  Variable	       Default Value
	--------  ----------------     -------------
	   dav:   *g:netrw_dav_cmd*      = "cadaver"    if cadaver is executable
	   dav:   g:netrw_dav_cmd      = "curl -o"    elseif curl is available
	 fetch:   *g:netrw_fetch_cmd*    = "fetch -o"   if fetch is available
	   ftp:   *g:netrw_ftp_cmd*      = "ftp"
	  http:   *g:netrw_http_cmd*     = "elinks"     if   elinks  is available
	  http:   g:netrw_http_cmd     = "links"      elseif links is available
	  http:   g:netrw_http_cmd     = "curl"       elseif curl  is available
	  http:   g:netrw_http_cmd     = "wget"       elseif wget  is available
	  http:   g:netrw_http_cmd     = "fetch"      elseif fetch is available
	  http:   *g:netrw_http_put_cmd* = "curl -T"
	   rcp:   *g:netrw_rcp_cmd*      = "rcp"
	 rsync:   *g:netrw_rsync_cmd*    = "rsync"     (see |g:netrw_rsync_sep|)
	   scp:   *g:netrw_scp_cmd*      = "scp -q"
	  sftp:   *g:netrw_sftp_cmd*     = "sftp"
	  file:   *g:netrw_file_cmd*     = "elinks" or "links"

	*g:netrw_http_xcmd* : the option string for http://... protocols are
	specified via this variable and may be independently overridden.  By
	default, the option arguments for the http-handling commands are: >

		    elinks : "-source >"
		    links  : "-dump >"
		    curl   : "-L -o"
		    wget   : "-q -O"
		    fetch  : "-o"
<
	For example, if your system has elinks, and you'd rather see the
	page using an attempt at rendering the text, you may wish to have >
		let g:netrw_http_xcmd= "-dump >"
<	in your .vimrc.

	g:netrw_http_put_cmd: this option specifies both the executable and
	any needed options.  This command does a PUT operation to the url.


READING						*netrw-read* *netrw-nread* {{{2

	Generally, one may just use the URL notation with a normal editing
	command, such as >

		:e ftp://[user@]machine/path
<
	Netrw also provides the Nread command:

	:Nread ?					give help
	:Nread "machine:path"				uses rcp
	:Nread "machine path"				uses ftp w/ <.netrc>
	:Nread "machine id password path"		uses ftp
	:Nread "dav://machine[:port]/path"		uses cadaver
	:Nread "fetch://[user@]machine/path"		uses fetch
	:Nread "ftp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses ftp w/ <.netrc>
	:Nread "http://[user@]machine/path"		uses http  uses wget
	:Nread "rcp://[user@]machine/path"		uses rcp
	:Nread "rsync://[user@]machine[:port]/path"	uses rsync
	:Nread "scp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses scp
	:Nread "sftp://[user@]machine/path"		uses sftp

WRITING					*netrw-write* *netrw-nwrite* {{{2

	One may just use the URL notation with a normal file writing
	command, such as >

		:w ftp://[user@]machine/path
<
	Netrw also provides the Nwrite command:

	:Nwrite ?					give help
	:Nwrite "machine:path"				uses rcp
	:Nwrite "machine path"				uses ftp w/ <.netrc>
	:Nwrite "machine id password path"		uses ftp
	:Nwrite "dav://machine[:port]/path"		uses cadaver
	:Nwrite "ftp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses ftp w/ <.netrc>
	:Nwrite "rcp://[user@]machine/path"		uses rcp
	:Nwrite "rsync://[user@]machine[:port]/path"	uses rsync
	:Nwrite "scp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses scp
	:Nwrite "sftp://[user@]machine/path"		uses sftp
	http: not supported!

SOURCING					*netrw-source* {{{2

	One may just use the URL notation with the normal file sourcing
	command, such as >

		:so ftp://[user@]machine/path
<
	Netrw also provides the Nsource command:

	:Nsource ?					give help
	:Nsource "dav://machine[:port]/path"		uses cadaver
	:Nsource "fetch://[user@]machine/path"		uses fetch
	:Nsource "ftp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses ftp w/ <.netrc>
	:Nsource "http://[user@]machine/path"		uses http  uses wget
	:Nsource "rcp://[user@]machine/path"		uses rcp
	:Nsource "rsync://[user@]machine[:port]/path"	uses rsync
	:Nsource "scp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path"	uses scp
	:Nsource "sftp://[user@]machine/path"		uses sftp

DIRECTORY LISTING		*netrw-trailingslash* *netrw-dirlist* {{{2

	One may browse a directory to get a listing by simply attempting to
	edit the directory: >

		:e scp://[user]@hostname/path/
		:e ftp://[user]@hostname/path/
<
	For remote directory listings (ie. those using scp or ftp), that
	trailing "/" is necessary (the slash tells netrw to treat the argument
	as a directory to browse instead of as a file to download).

	The Nread command may also be used to accomplish this (again, that
	trailing slash is necessary): >

		:Nread [protocol]://[user]@hostname/path/
<
					*netrw-login* *netrw-password*
CHANGING USERID AND PASSWORD		*netrw-chgup* *netrw-userpass* {{{2

	Attempts to use ftp will prompt you for a user-id and a password.
	These will be saved in global variables |g:netrw_uid| and
	|s:netrw_passwd|; subsequent use of ftp will re-use those two strings,
	thereby simplifying use of ftp.  However, if you need to use a
	different user id and/or password, you'll want to call |NetUserPass()|
	first.  To work around the need to enter passwords, check if your ftp
	supports a <.netrc> file in your home directory.  Also see
	|netrw-passwd| (and if you're using ssh/scp hoping to figure out how
	to not need to use passwords for scp, look at |netrw-ssh-hack|).

	:NetUserPass [uid [password]]		-- prompts as needed
	:call NetUserPass()			-- prompts for uid and password
	:call NetUserPass("uid")		-- prompts for password
	:call NetUserPass("uid","password")	-- sets global uid and password

(Related topics: |ftp| |netrw-userpass| |netrw-start|)

NETRW VARIABLES AND SETTINGS				*netrw-variables* {{{2
    (Also see:
    |netrw-browser-var|     : netrw browser option variables
    |netrw-protocol|        : file transfer protocol option variables
    |netrw-settings|        : additional file transfer options
    |netrw-browser-options| : these options affect browsing directories
    )

Netrw provides a lot of variables which allow you to customize netrw to your
preferences.  One way to look at them is via the command :NetrwSettings (see
|netrw-settings|) which will display your current netrw settings.  Most such
settings are described below, in |netrw-browser-options|, and in
|netrw-externapp|:

 *b:netrw_lastfile*	last file Network-read/written retained on a
			per-buffer basis (supports plain :Nw )

 *g:netrw_bufsettings*	the settings that netrw buffers have
			(default) noma nomod nonu nowrap ro nobl

 *g:netrw_chgwin*	specifies a window number where subsequent file edits
			will take place.  (also see |netrw-C|)
			(default) -1

 *g:Netrw_funcref*	specifies a function (or functions) to be called when
			netrw edits a file.  The file is first edited, and
			then the function reference (|Funcref|) is called.
			This variable may also hold a |List| of Funcrefs.
			(default) not defined.  (the capital in g:Netrw...
			is required by its holding a function reference)
>
			    Example: place in .vimrc; affects all file opening
			    fun! MyFuncRef()
			    endfun
			    let g:Netrw_funcref= function("MyFuncRef")

<
 *g:Netrw_UserMaps*	specifies a function or |List| of functions which can
			be used to set up user-specified maps and functionality.
			See |netrw-usermaps|

 *g:netrw_ftp*		   if it doesn't exist, use default ftp
			=0 use default ftp		       (uid password)
			=1 use alternate ftp method	  (user uid password)
			   If you're having trouble with ftp, try changing the
			   value of this variable to see if the alternate ftp
			   method works for your setup.

 *g:netrw_ftp_options*     Chosen by default, these options are supposed to
			 turn interactive prompting off and to restrain ftp
			 from attempting auto-login upon initial connection.
			 However, it appears that not all ftp implementations
			 support this (ex. ncftp).
		        ="-i -n"

 *g:netrw_ftpextracmd*	default: doesn't exist
			If this variable exists, then any string it contains
			will be placed into the commands set to your ftp
			client.  As an example:
			   ="passive"

 *g:netrw_ftpmode*	="binary"				    (default)
			="ascii"

 *g:netrw_ignorenetrc*	=0 (default for linux, cygwin)
			=1 If you have a <.netrc> file but it doesn't work and
			   you want it ignored, then set this variable as
			   shown. (default for Windows + cmd.exe)

 *g:netrw_menu*		=0 disable netrw's menu
			=1 (default) netrw's menu enabled

 *g:netrw_nogx*		if this variable exists, then the "gx" map will not
			be available (see |netrw-gx|)

 *g:netrw_uid*		(ftp) user-id,      retained on a per-vim-session basis
 *s:netrw_passwd*	(ftp) password,     retained on a per-vim-session basis

 *g:netrw_preview*	=0 (default) preview window shown in a horizontally
			   split window
			=1 preview window shown in a vertically split window.
			   Also affects the "previous window" (see |netrw-P|)
			   in the same way.
			The |g:netrw_alto| variable may be used to provide
			additional splitting control:
				g:netrw_preview g:netrw_alto result
				         0             0     |:aboveleft|
				         0             1     |:belowright|
				         1             0     |:topleft|
				         1             1     |:botright|
			To control sizing, see |g:netrw_winsize|

 *g:netrw_scpport*	= "-P" : option to use to set port for scp
 *g:netrw_sshport*	= "-p" : option to use to set port for ssh

 *g:netrw_sepchr*	=\0xff
			=\0x01 for enc == euc-jp (and perhaps it should be for
			   others, too, please let me know)
			   Separates priority codes from filenames internally.
			   See |netrw-p12|.

  *g:netrw_silent*	=0 : transfers done normally
			=1 : transfers done silently

 *g:netrw_use_errorwindow* =2: messages from netrw will use a popup window
			     Move the mouse and pause to remove the popup window.
			     (default value if popup windows are available)
			 =1 : messages from netrw will use a separate one
			      line window.  This window provides reliable
			      delivery of messages.
			     (default value if popup windows are not available)
			 =0 : messages from netrw will use echoerr ;
			      messages don't always seem to show up this
			      way, but one doesn't have to quit the window.

 *g:netrw_win95ftp*	=1 if using Win95, will remove four trailing blank
			   lines that o/s's ftp "provides" on transfers
			=0 force normal ftp behavior (no trailing line removal)

 *g:netrw_cygwin*	=1 assume scp under windows is from cygwin. Also
			   permits network browsing to use ls with time and
			   size sorting (default if windows)
			=0 assume Windows' scp accepts windows-style paths
			   Network browsing uses dir instead of ls
			   This option is ignored if you're using unix

 *g:netrw_use_nt_rcp*	=0 don't use the rcp of WinNT, Win2000 and WinXP
			=1 use WinNT's rcp in binary mode         (default)

PATHS							*netrw-path* {{{2

Paths to files are generally user-directory relative for most protocols.
It is possible that some protocol will make paths relative to some
associated directory, however.
>
	example:  vim scp://user@host/somefile
	example:  vim scp://user@host/subdir1/subdir2/somefile
<
where "somefile" is in the "user"'s home directory.  If you wish to get a
file using root-relative paths, use the full path:
>
	example:  vim scp://user@host//somefile
	example:  vim scp://user@host//subdir1/subdir2/somefile
<

==============================================================================
4. Network-Oriented File Transfer			*netrw-xfer* {{{1

Network-oriented file transfer under Vim is implemented by a vim script
(<netrw.vim>) using plugin techniques.  It currently supports both reading and
writing across networks using rcp, scp, ftp or ftp+<.netrc>, scp, fetch,
dav/cadaver, rsync, or sftp.

http is currently supported read-only via use of wget or fetch.

<netrw.vim> is a standard plugin which acts as glue between Vim and the
various file transfer programs.  It uses autocommand events (BufReadCmd,
FileReadCmd, BufWriteCmd) to intercept reads/writes with url-like filenames. >

	ex. vim ftp://hostname/path/to/file
<
The characters preceding the colon specify the protocol to use; in the
example, it's ftp.  The <netrw.vim> script then formulates a command or a
series of commands (typically ftp) which it issues to an external program
(ftp, scp, etc) which does the actual file transfer/protocol.  Files are read
from/written to a temporary file (under Unix/Linux, /tmp/...) which the
<netrw.vim> script will clean up.

Now, a word about Jan Minář's "FTP User Name and Password Disclosure"; first,
ftp is not a secure protocol.  User names and passwords are transmitted "in
the clear" over the internet; any snooper tool can pick these up; this is not
a netrw thing, this is a ftp thing.  If you're concerned about this, please
try to use scp or sftp instead.

Netrw re-uses the user id and password during the same vim session and so long
as the remote hostname remains the same.

Jan seems to be a bit confused about how netrw handles ftp; normally multiple
commands are performed in a "ftp session", and he seems to feel that the
uid/password should only be retained over one ftp session.  However, netrw
does every ftp operation in a separate "ftp session"; so remembering the
uid/password for just one "ftp session" would be the same as not remembering
the uid/password at all.  IMHO this would rapidly grow tiresome as one
browsed remote directories, for example.

On the other hand, thanks go to Jan M. for pointing out the many
vulnerabilities that netrw (and vim itself) had had in handling "crafted"
filenames.  The |shellescape()| and |fnameescape()| functions were written in
response by Bram Moolenaar to handle these sort of problems, and netrw has
been modified to use them.  Still, my advice is, if the "filename" looks like
a vim command that you aren't comfortable with having executed, don't open it.

				*netrw-putty* *netrw-pscp* *netrw-psftp*
One may modify any protocol's implementing external application by setting a
variable (ex. scp uses the variable g:netrw_scp_cmd, which is defaulted to
"scp -q").  As an example, consider using PuTTY: >

	let g:netrw_scp_cmd = '"c:\Program Files\PuTTY\pscp.exe" -q -batch'
	let g:netrw_sftp_cmd= '"c:\Program Files\PuTTY\psftp.exe"'
<
(note: it has been reported that windows 7 with putty v0.6's "-batch" option
       doesn't work, so its best to leave it off for that system)

See |netrw-p8| for more about putty, pscp, psftp, etc.

Ftp, an old protocol, seems to be blessed by numerous implementations.
Unfortunately, some implementations are noisy (ie., add junk to the end of the
file).  Thus, concerned users may decide to write a NetReadFixup() function
that will clean up after reading with their ftp.  Some Unix systems (ie.,
FreeBSD) provide a utility called "fetch" which uses the ftp protocol but is
not noisy and more convenient, actually, for <netrw.vim> to use.
Consequently, if "fetch" is available (ie. executable), it may be preferable
to use it for ftp://... based transfers.

For rcp, scp, sftp, and http, one may use network-oriented file transfers
transparently; ie.
>
	vim rcp://[user@]machine/path
	vim scp://[user@]machine/path
<
If your ftp supports <.netrc>, then it too can be transparently used
if the needed triad of machine name, user id, and password are present in
that file.  Your ftp must be able to use the <.netrc> file on its own, however.
>
	vim ftp://[user@]machine[[:#]portnumber]/path
<
Windows provides an ftp (typically c:\Windows\System32\ftp.exe) which uses
an option, -s:filename (filename can and probably should be a full path)
which contains ftp commands which will be automatically run whenever ftp
starts.  You may use this feature to enter a user and password for one site: >
	userid
	password
<				*netrw-windows-netrc*  *netrw-windows-s*
If |g:netrw_ftp_cmd| contains -s:[path/]MACHINE, then (on Windows machines
only) netrw will substitute the current machine name requested for ftp
connections for MACHINE.  Hence one can have multiple machine.ftp files
containing login and password for ftp.  Example: >

    let g:netrw_ftp_cmd= 'c:\Windows\System32\ftp -s:C:\Users\Myself\MACHINE'
    vim ftp://myhost.somewhere.net/

will use a file >

	C:\Users\Myself\myhost.ftp
<
Often, ftp will need to query the user for the userid and password.
The latter will be done "silently"; ie. asterisks will show up instead of
the actually-typed-in password.  Netrw will retain the userid and password
for subsequent read/writes from the most recent transfer so subsequent
transfers (read/write) to or from that machine will take place without
additional prompting.

  +=================================+============================+============+

	(*1) For an absolute path use scp://machine//path.

	(*2) if <.netrc> is present, it is assumed that it will
	work with your ftp client.  Otherwise the script will
	prompt for user-id and password.

        (*3) for ftp, "machine" may be machine#port or machine:port
	if a different port is needed than the standard ftp port

	(*4) for http:..., if wget is available it will be used.  Otherwise,
	if fetch is available it will be used.

Both the :Nread and the :Nwrite ex-commands can accept multiple filenames.


NETRC							*netrw-netrc*

The <.netrc> file, typically located in your home directory, contains lines
therein which map a hostname (machine name) to the user id and password you
prefer to use with it.

The typical syntax for lines in a <.netrc> file is given as shown below.
Ftp under Unix usually supports <.netrc>; ftp under Windows usually doesn't.
>
	machine {full machine name} login {user-id} password "{password}"
	default login {user-id} password "{password}"

Your ftp client must handle the use of <.netrc> on its own, but if the
<.netrc> file exists, an ftp transfer will not ask for the user-id or
password.

	Note:
	Since this file contains passwords, make very sure nobody else can
	read this file!  Most programs will refuse to use a .netrc that is
	readable for others.  Don't forget that the system administrator can
	still read the file!  Ie. for Linux/Unix: chmod 600 .netrc

Even though Windows' ftp clients typically do not support .netrc, netrw has
a work-around: see |netrw-windows-s|.


PASSWORD						*netrw-passwd*

The script attempts to get passwords for ftp invisibly using |inputsecret()|,
a built-in Vim function.  See |netrw-userpass| for how to change the password
after one has set it.

Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a way for netrw to feed a password to
scp.  Thus every transfer via scp will require re-entry of the password.
However, |netrw-ssh-hack| can help with this problem.


==============================================================================
5. Activation						*netrw-activate* {{{1

Network-oriented file transfers are available by default whenever Vim's
|'nocompatible'| mode is enabled.  Netrw's script files reside in your
system's plugin, autoload, and syntax directories; just the
plugin/netrwPlugin.vim script is sourced automatically whenever you bring up
vim.  The main script in autoload/netrw.vim is only loaded when you actually
use netrw.  I suggest that, at a minimum, you have at least the following in
your <.vimrc> customization file: >

	set nocp
	if version >= 600
	  filetype plugin indent on
	endif
<
By also including the following lines in your .vimrc, one may have netrw
immediately activate when using [g]vim without any filenames, showing the
current directory: >

	" Augroup VimStartup:
	augroup VimStartup
	  au!
	  au VimEnter * if expand("%") == "" | e . | endif
	augroup END
<

==============================================================================
6. Transparent Remote File Editing		*netrw-transparent* {{{1

Transparent file transfers occur whenever a regular file read or write
(invoked via an |:autocmd| for |BufReadCmd|, |BufWriteCmd|, or |SourceCmd|
events) is made.  Thus one may read, write, or source  files across networks
just as easily as if they were local files! >

	vim ftp://[user@]machine/path
	...
	:wq

See |netrw-activate| for more on how to encourage your vim to use plugins
such as netrw.

For password-free use of scp:, see |netrw-ssh-hack|.


==============================================================================
7. Ex Commands						*netrw-ex* {{{1

The usual read/write commands are supported.  There are also a few
additional commands available.  Often you won't need to use Nwrite or
Nread as shown in |netrw-transparent| (ie. simply use >
  :e URL
  :r URL
  :w URL
instead, as appropriate) -- see |netrw-urls|.  In the explanations
below, a {netfile} is a URL to a remote file.

						*:Nwrite*  *:Nw*
:[range]Nw[rite]	Write the specified lines to the current
		file as specified in b:netrw_lastfile.
		(related: |netrw-nwrite|)

:[range]Nw[rite] {netfile} [{netfile}]...
		Write the specified lines to the {netfile}.

						*:Nread*   *:Nr*
:Nr[ead]	Read the lines from the file specified in b:netrw_lastfile
		into the current buffer.  (related: |netrw-nread|)

:Nr[ead] {netfile} {netfile}...
		Read the {netfile} after the current line.

						*:Nsource* *:Ns*
:Ns[ource] {netfile}
		Source the {netfile}.
		To start up vim using a remote .vimrc, one may use
		the following (all on one line) (tnx to Antoine Mechelynck) >
		vim -u NORC -N
		 --cmd "runtime plugin/netrwPlugin.vim"
		 --cmd "source scp://HOSTNAME/.vimrc"
<		 (related: |netrw-source|)

:call NetUserPass()				*NetUserPass()*
		If g:netrw_uid and s:netrw_passwd don't exist,
		this function will query the user for them.
		(related: |netrw-userpass|)

:call NetUserPass("userid")
		This call will set the g:netrw_uid and, if
		the password doesn't exist, will query the user for it.
		(related: |netrw-userpass|)

:call NetUserPass("userid","passwd")
		This call will set both the g:netrw_uid and s:netrw_passwd.
		The user-id and password are used by ftp transfers.  One may
		effectively remove the user-id and password by using empty
		strings (ie. "").
		(related: |netrw-userpass|)

:NetrwSettings  This command is described in |netrw-settings| -- used to
                display netrw settings and change netrw behavior.


==============================================================================
8. Variables and Options		*netrw-var* *netrw-settings* {{{1

(also see: |netrw-options| |netrw-variables| |netrw-protocol|
           |netrw-browser-settings| |netrw-browser-options| )

The <netrw.vim> script provides several variables which act as options to
affect <netrw.vim>'s file transfer behavior.  These variables typically may be
set in the user's <.vimrc> file: (see also |netrw-settings| |netrw-protocol|)

<
								*netrw-ftp*

The g:netrw_..._cmd options (|g:netrw_ftp_cmd| and |g:netrw_sftp_cmd|)
specify the external program to use handle the ftp protocol.  They may
include command line options (such as -p for passive mode). Example: >

	let g:netrw_ftp_cmd= "ftp -p"
<
Browsing is supported by using the |g:netrw_list_cmd|; the substring
"HOSTNAME" will be changed via substitution with whatever the current request
is for a hostname.

Two options (|g:netrw_ftp| and |netrw-fixup|) both help with certain ftp's
that give trouble .  In order to best understand how to use these options if
ftp is giving you troubles, a bit of discussion is provided on how netrw does
ftp reads.

For ftp, netrw typically builds up lines of one of the following formats in a
temporary file:
>
  IF g:netrw_ftp !exists or is not 1     IF g:netrw_ftp exists and is 1
  ----------------------------------     ------------------------------
<
       open machine [port]                    open machine [port]
       user userid password                   userid password
       [g:netrw_ftpmode]                      password
       [g:netrw_ftpextracmd]                  [g:netrw_ftpmode]
       get filename tempfile                  [g:netrw_extracmd]
                                              get filename tempfile >
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
<
The |g:netrw_ftpmode| and |g:netrw_ftpextracmd| are optional.

Netrw then executes the lines above by use of a filter:
>
	:%! {g:netrw_ftp_cmd} -i [-n]
<
where
	g:netrw_ftp_cmd is usually "ftp",
	-i tells ftp not to be interactive
	-n means don't use netrc and is used for Method #3 (ftp w/o <.netrc>)

If <.netrc> exists it will be used to avoid having to query the user for
userid and password.  The transferred file is put into a temporary file.
The temporary file is then read into the main editing session window that
requested it and the temporary file deleted.

If your ftp doesn't accept the "user" command and immediately just demands a
userid, then try putting "let netrw_ftp=1" in your <.vimrc>.

								*netrw-cadaver*
To handle the SSL certificate dialog for untrusted servers, one may pull
down the certificate and place it into /usr/ssl/cert.pem.  This operation
renders the server treatment as "trusted".

						*netrw-fixup* *netreadfixup*
If your ftp for whatever reason generates unwanted lines (such as AUTH
messages) you may write a NetReadFixup() function:
>
    function! NetReadFixup(method,line1,line2)
      " a:line1: first new line in current file
      " a:line2: last  new line in current file

The NetReadFixup() function will be called if it exists and thus allows you to
customize your reading process.  As a further example, <netrw.vim> contains
just such a function to handle Windows 95 ftp.  For whatever reason, Windows
95's ftp dumps four blank lines at the end of a transfer, and so it is
desirable to automate their removal.  Here's some code taken from <netrw.vim>
itself:
>
    if has("win95") && g:netrw_win95ftp
     fun! NetReadFixup(method, line1, line2)
       if method == 3   " ftp (no <.netrc>)

INTRODUCTION TO BROWSING			*netrw-intro-browse* {{{2
	(Quick References: |netrw-quickmaps| |netrw-quickcoms|)

Netrw supports the browsing of directories on your local system and on remote
hosts; browsing includes listing files and directories, entering directories,
editing files therein, deleting files/directories, making new directories,
moving (renaming) files and directories, copying files and directories, etc.
One may mark files and execute any system command on them!  The Netrw browser
generally implements the previous explorer's maps and commands for remote
directories, although details (such as pertinent global variable names)
necessarily differ.  To browse a directory, simply "edit" it! >

	vim /your/directory/
	vim .
	vim c:\your\directory\
<
(Related topics: |netrw-cr|  |netrw-o|  |netrw-p| |netrw-P| |netrw-t|
                 |netrw-mf|  |netrw-mx| |netrw-D| |netrw-R| |netrw-v| )

The Netrw remote file and directory browser handles two protocols: ssh and
ftp.  The protocol in the url, if it is ftp, will cause netrw also to use ftp
in its remote browsing.  Specifying any other protocol will cause it to be
used for file transfers; but the ssh protocol will be used to do remote
browsing.

To use Netrw's remote directory browser, simply attempt to read a "file" with
a trailing slash and it will be interpreted as a request to list a directory:
>
	vim [protocol]://[user@]hostname/path/
<
where [protocol] is typically scp or ftp.  As an example, try: >

	vim ftp://ftp.home.vim.org/pub/vim/
<
For local directories, the trailing slash is not required.  Again, because it's
easy to miss: to browse remote directories, the URL must terminate with a
slash!

If you'd like to avoid entering the password repeatedly for remote directory
listings with ssh or scp, see |netrw-ssh-hack|.  To avoid password entry with
ftp, see |netrw-netrc| (if your ftp supports it).

There are several things you can do to affect the browser's display of files:

	* To change the listing style, press the "i" key (|netrw-i|).
	  Currently there are four styles: thin, long, wide, and tree.
	  To make that change "permanent", see |g:netrw_liststyle|.

	* To hide files (don't want to see those xyz~ files anymore?) see
	  |netrw-ctrl-h|.

	* Press s to sort files by name, time, or size.

See |netrw-browse-cmds| for all the things you can do with netrw!

			*netrw-getftype* *netrw-filigree* *netrw-ftype*
The |getftype()| function is used to append a bit of filigree to indicate
filetype to locally listed files:

	directory  : /
	executable : *
	fifo       : |
	links      : @
	sockets    : =

The filigree also affects the |g:netrw_sort_sequence|.

One may toggle the displaying of the banner by pressing "I".

BOOKMARKING A DIRECTORY		*netrw-mb* *netrw-bookmark* *netrw-bookmarks* {{{2

One may easily "bookmark" the currently browsed directory by using >

	mb
<
								*.netrwbook*
Bookmarks are retained in between sessions of vim in a file called .netrwbook
as a |List|, which is typically stored in the first directory on the user's
'runtimepath'; entries are kept in sorted order.

If there are marked files and/or directories, mb will add them to the bookmark
list.

								*netrw-:NetrwMB*
Additionally, one may use :NetrwMB to bookmark files or directories. >

	:NetrwMB[!] [files/directories]

< No bang: enters files/directories into Netrw's bookmark system

   No argument and in netrw buffer:
     if there are marked files        : bookmark marked files
     otherwise                        : bookmark file/directory under cursor
   No argument and not in netrw buffer: bookmarks current open file
   Has arguments                      : |glob()|s each arg and bookmarks them

 With bang: deletes files/directories from Netrw's bookmark system

The :NetrwMB command is available outside of netrw buffers (once netrw has been
invoked in the session).

The file ".netrwbook" holds bookmarks when netrw (and vim) is not active.  By
default, its stored on the first directory on the user's |'runtimepath'|.

BROWSING					*netrw-enter*	*netrw-cr* {{{2

Browsing is simple: move the cursor onto a file or directory of interest.
Hitting the <cr> (the return key) will select the file or directory.
Directories will themselves be listed, and files will be opened using the
protocol given in the original read request.

  CAVEAT: There are four forms of listing (see |netrw-i|).  Netrw assumes that
  two or more spaces delimit filenames and directory names for the long and
  wide listing formats.  Thus, if your filename or directory name has two or
  more sequential spaces embedded in it, or any trailing spaces, then you'll
  need to use the "thin" format to select it.

The |g:netrw_browse_split| option, which is zero by default, may be used to
cause the opening of files to be done in a new window or tab instead of the
default.  When the option is one or two, the splitting will be taken
horizontally or vertically, respectively.  When the option is set to three, a
<cr> will cause the file to appear in a new tab.


When using the gui (gvim), one may select a file by pressing the <leftmouse>
button.  In addition, if

 * |g:netrw_retmap| == 1       AND   (its default value is 0)
 * in a netrw-selected file, AND
 * the user doesn't already have a <2-leftmouse> mapping defined before
   netrw is loaded

then a doubly-clicked leftmouse button will return to the netrw browser
window.

Netrw attempts to speed up browsing, especially for remote browsing where one
may have to enter passwords, by keeping and re-using previously obtained
directory listing buffers.  The |g:netrw_fastbrowse| variable is used to
control this behavior; one may have slow browsing (no buffer re-use), medium
speed browsing (re-use directory buffer listings only for remote directories),
and fast browsing (re-use directory buffer listings as often as possible).
The price for such re-use is that when changes are made (such as new files
are introduced into a directory), the listing may become out-of-date.  One may
always refresh directory listing buffers by pressing ctrl-L (see
|netrw-ctrl-l|).

								*netrw-s-cr*
Squeezing the Current Tree-Listing Directory~

When the tree listing style is enabled (see |netrw-i|) and one is using
gvim, then the <s-cr> mapping may be used to squeeze (close) the
directory currently containing the cursor.

Otherwise, one may remap a key combination of one's own choice to get
this effect: >

    nmap <buffer> <silent> <nowait> YOURKEYCOMBO  <Plug>NetrwTreeSqueeze
<
Put this line in $HOME/ftplugin/netrw/netrw.vim; it needs to be generated
for netrw buffers only.

BROWSING WITH A HORIZONTALLY SPLIT WINDOW	*netrw-o* *netrw-horiz* {{{2

Normally one enters a file or directory using the <cr>.  However, the "o" map
allows one to open a new window to hold the new directory listing or file.  A
horizontal split is used.  (for vertical splitting, see |netrw-v|)

Normally, the o key splits the window horizontally with the new window and
cursor at the top.

   |g:netrw_winsize| control initial sizing

BROWSING WITH A NEW TAB				*netrw-t* {{{2

Normally one enters a file or directory using the <cr>.  The "t" map
allows one to open a new window holding the new directory listing or file in
a new tab.

If you'd like to have the new listing in a background tab, use |gT|.

BROWSING WITH A VERTICALLY SPLIT WINDOW			*netrw-v* {{{2

Normally one enters a file or directory using the <cr>.  However, the "v" map
allows one to open a new window to hold the new directory listing or file.  A
vertical split is used.  (for horizontal splitting, see |netrw-o|)

Normally, the v key splits the window vertically with the new window and
cursor at the left.

There is only one tree listing buffer; using "v" on a displayed subdirectory
will split the screen, but the same buffer will be shown twice.

BROWSING USING A GVIM SERVER			*netrw-ctrl-r* {{{2

One may keep a browsing gvim separate from the gvim being used to edit.
Use the <c-r> map on a file (not a directory) in the netrw browser, and it
will use a gvim server (see |g:netrw_servername|).  Subsequent use of <cr>
(see |netrw-cr|) will re-use that server for editing files.

Associated setting variables:
	|g:netrw_servername|   : sets name of server
	|g:netrw_browse_split| : controls how <cr> will open files


CHANGE LISTING STYLE  (THIN LONG WIDE TREE)			*netrw-i* {{{2

The "i" map cycles between the thin, long, wide, and tree listing formats.

The thin listing format gives just the files' and directories' names.

The long listing is either based on the "ls" command via ssh for remote
directories or displays the filename, file size (in bytes), and the time and
date of last modification for local directories.  With the long listing
format, netrw is not able to recognize filenames which have trailing spaces.
Use the thin listing format for such files.

The wide listing format uses two or more contiguous spaces to delineate
filenames; when using that format, netrw won't be able to recognize or use
filenames which have two or more contiguous spaces embedded in the name or any
trailing spaces.  The thin listing format will, however, work with such files.
The wide listing format is the most compact.

The tree listing format has a top directory followed by files and directories
preceded by one or more "|"s, which indicate the directory depth.  One may
open and close directories by pressing the <cr> key while atop the directory
name.

One may make a preferred listing style your default; see |g:netrw_liststyle|.
As an example, by putting the following line in your .vimrc, >
	let g:netrw_liststyle= 3
the tree style will become your default listing style.

One typical way to use the netrw tree display is to: >

	vim .
	(use i until a tree display shows)
	navigate to a file
	v  (edit as desired in vertically split window)
	ctrl-w h  (to return to the netrw listing)
	P (edit newly selected file in the previous window)
	ctrl-w h  (to return to the netrw listing)
	P (edit newly selected file in the previous window)
	...etc...

CHANGE FILE PERMISSION						*netrw-gp* {{{2

"gp" will ask you for a new permission for the file named under the cursor.
Currently, this only works for local files.

Associated setting variables: |g:netrw_chgperm|


CHANGING TO A BOOKMARKED DIRECTORY			*netrw-gb*  {{{2

To change directory back to a bookmarked directory, use

	{cnt}gb

Any count may be used to reference any of the bookmarks.
Note that |netrw-qb| shows both bookmarks and history; to go
to a location stored in the history see |netrw-u| and |netrw-U|.

CHANGING TO A PREDECESSOR DIRECTORY		*netrw-u* *netrw-updir* {{{2

Every time you change to a new directory (new for the current session), netrw
will save the directory in a recently-visited directory history list (unless
|g:netrw_dirhistmax| is zero; by default, it holds ten entries).  With the "u"
map, one can change to an earlier directory (predecessor).  To do the
opposite, see |netrw-U|.

The "u" map also accepts counts to go back in the history several slots.  For
your convenience, qb (see |netrw-qb|) lists the history number which may be
used in that count.

						*.netrwhist*
See |g:netrw_dirhistmax| for how to control the quantity of history stack
slots.  The file ".netrwhist" holds history when netrw (and vim) is not
active.  By default, its stored on the first directory on the user's
|'runtimepath'|.

CHANGING TO A SUCCESSOR DIRECTORY		*netrw-U* *netrw-downdir* {{{2

With the "U" map, one can change to a later directory (successor).
This map is the opposite of the "u" map. (see |netrw-u|)  Use the
qb map to list both the bookmarks and history. (see |netrw-qb|)

The "U" map also accepts counts to go forward in the history several slots.

See |g:netrw_dirhistmax| for how to control the quantity of history stack
slots.


CHANGING TREE TOP			*netrw-ntree*  *:Ntree*  *netrw-gn* {{{2

One may specify a new tree top for tree listings using >

	:Ntree [dirname]

Without a "dirname", the current line is used (and any leading depth
information is elided).
With a "dirname", the specified directory name is used.

The "gn" map will take the word below the cursor and use that for
changing the top of the tree listing.


NETRW CLEAN					*netrw-clean* *:NetrwClean* {{{2

With :NetrwClean one may easily remove netrw from one's home directory;
more precisely, from the first directory on your |'runtimepath'|.

With :NetrwClean!, netrw will attempt to remove netrw from all directories on
your |'runtimepath'|.  Of course, you have to have write/delete permissions
correct to do this.

With either form of the command, netrw will first ask for confirmation
that the removal is in fact what you want to do.  If netrw doesn't have
permission to remove a file, it will issue an error message.

CUSTOMIZING BROWSING WITH A SPECIAL HANDLER	*netrw-x* *netrw-handler* {{{2
						(also see |netrw_filehandler|)

Certain files, such as html, gif, jpeg, (word/office) doc, etc, files, are
best seen with a special handler (ie. a tool provided with your computer's
operating system).  Netrw allows one to invoke such special handlers by: >

	* when Exploring, hit the "x" key
	* when editing, hit gx with the cursor atop the special filename
<	  (latter not available if the |g:netrw_nogx| variable exists)

Netrw determines which special handler by the following method:

  * if |g:netrw_browsex_viewer| exists, then it will be used to attempt to
    view files.  Examples of useful settings (place into your <.vimrc>): >

	:let g:netrw_browsex_viewer= "kfmclient exec"
<   or >
	:let g:netrw_browsex_viewer= "xdg-open"
<
    If g:netrw_browsex_viewer == '-', then netrwFileHandlers#Invoke() will be
    used instead (see |netrw_filehandler|).

    If the viewer you wish to use does not support handling of a remote URL
    directory, set |g:netrw_browsex_support_remote| to 0.
  * for Windows 32 or 64, the URL and FileProtocolHandler dlls are used.
  * for Gnome (with gnome-open): gnome-open is used.
  * for KDE (with kfmclient)   : kfmclient is used
  * for Mac OS X               : open is used.
  * otherwise the netrwFileHandler plugin is used.

The file's suffix is used by these various approaches to determine an
appropriate application to use to "handle" these files.  Such things as
OpenOffice (*.sfx), visualization (*.jpg, *.gif, etc), and PostScript (*.ps,
*.eps) can be handled.

The gx mapping extends to all buffers; apply "gx" while atop a word and netrw
will apply a special handler to it (like "x" works when in a netrw buffer).
One may also use visual mode (see |visual-start|) to select the text that the
special handler will use.  Normally gx uses expand("<cfile>") to pick up the
text under the cursor; one may change what |expand()| uses via the
|g:netrw_gx| variable (options include "<cword>", "<cWORD>").  Note that
expand("<cfile>") depends on the |'isfname'| setting.  Alternatively, one may
select the text to be used by gx by making a visual selection (see
|visual-block|) and then pressing gx.

Associated setting variables:
	|g:netrw_gx|	control how gx picks up the text under the cursor
	|g:netrw_nogx|	prevent gx map while editing
	|g:netrw_suppress_gx_mesg| controls gx's suppression of browser messages

							*netrw_filehandler*

When |g:netrw_browsex_viewer| exists and is "-", then netrw will attempt to
handle the special file with a vim function.  The "x" map applies a function
to a file, based on its extension.  Of course, the handler function must exist
for it to be called!
>
 Ex. mypgm.html   x -> NFH_html("scp://user@host/some/path/mypgm.html")

<	Users may write their own netrw File Handler functions to
	support more suffixes with special handling.  See
	<autoload/netrwFileHandlers.vim> for examples on how to make
	file handler functions.   As an example: >

	" NFH_suffix(filename)
	fun! NFH_suffix(filename)
	..do something special with filename..
	endfun
<
These functions need to be defined in some file in your .vim/plugin
(vimfiles\plugin) directory.  Vim's function names may not have punctuation
characters (except for the underscore) in them.  To support suffices that
contain such characters, netrw will first convert the suffix using the
following table: >

    @ -> AT       ! -> EXCLAMATION    % -> PERCENT
    : -> COLON    = -> EQUAL          ? -> QUESTION
    , -> COMMA    - -> MINUS          ; -> SEMICOLON
    $ -> DOLLAR   + -> PLUS           ~ -> TILDE
<
So, for example: >

	file.rcs,v  ->  NFH_rcsCOMMAv()
<
If more such translations are necessary, please send me email: >
		NcampObell@SdrPchip.AorgM-NOSPAM
with a request.  (remove the embedded NOSPAM first)

Associated setting variable: |g:netrw_browsex_viewer|

							*netrw-curdir*
DELETING BOOKMARKS					*netrw-mB* {{{2

To delete a bookmark, use >

	{cnt}mB

If there are marked files, then mB will remove them from the
bookmark list.

Alternatively, one may use :NetrwMB! (see |netrw-:NetrwMB|). >

	:NetrwMB! [files/directories]

DELETING FILES OR DIRECTORIES	*netrw-delete* *netrw-D* *netrw-del* {{{2

If files have not been marked with |netrw-mf|:   (local marked file list)

    Deleting/removing files and directories involves moving the cursor to the
    file/directory to be deleted and pressing "D".  Directories must be empty
    first before they can be successfully removed.  If the directory is a
    softlink to a directory, then netrw will make two requests to remove the
    directory before succeeding.  Netrw will ask for confirmation before doing
    the removal(s).  You may select a range of lines with the "V" command
    (visual selection), and then pressing "D".

If files have been marked with |netrw-mf|:   (local marked file list)

    Marked files (and empty directories) will be deleted; again, you'll be
    asked to confirm the deletion before it actually takes place.

A further approach is to delete files which match a pattern.

    * use  :MF pattern  (see |netrw-:MF|); then press "D".

    * use mr (see |netrw-mr|) which will prompt you for pattern.
      This will cause the matching files to be marked.  Then,
      press "D".

If your vim has 7.4 with patch#1107, then |g:netrw_localrmdir| no longer
is used to remove directories; instead, vim's |delete()| is used with
the "d" option.  Please note that only empty directories may be deleted
with the "D" mapping.  Regular files are deleted with |delete()|, too.

The |g:netrw_rm_cmd|, |g:netrw_rmf_cmd|, and |g:netrw_rmdir_cmd| variables are
used to control the attempts to remove remote files and directories.  The
g:netrw_rm_cmd is used with files, and its default value is:

	g:netrw_rm_cmd: ssh HOSTNAME rm

The g:netrw_rmdir_cmd variable is used to support the removal of directories.
Its default value is:

	|g:netrw_rmdir_cmd|: ssh HOSTNAME rmdir

If removing a directory fails with g:netrw_rmdir_cmd, netrw then will attempt
to remove it again using the g:netrw_rmf_cmd variable.  Its default value is:

	|g:netrw_rmf_cmd|: ssh HOSTNAME rm -f

     :Nexplore............. go to next matching file                *:Nexplore*
     :Pexplore............. go to previous matching file            *:Pexplore*

						*netrw-:Explore*
:Explore  will open the local-directory browser on the current file's
          directory (or on directory [dir] if specified).  The window will be
	  split only if the file has been modified and |'hidden'| is not set,
	  otherwise the browsing window will take over that window.  Normally
	  the splitting is taken horizontally.
	  Also see: |netrw-:Rexplore|
:Explore! is like :Explore, but will use vertical splitting.

						*netrw-:Hexplore*
:Hexplore  [dir] does an :Explore with |:belowright| horizontal splitting.
:Hexplore! [dir] does an :Explore with |:aboveleft|  horizontal splitting.

						*netrw-:Lexplore*
:[N]Lexplore [dir] toggles a full height Explorer window on the left hand side
	  of the current tab.  It will open a netrw window on the current
	  directory if [dir] is omitted; a :Lexplore [dir] will show the
	  specified directory in the left-hand side browser display no matter
	  from which window the command is issued.

	  By default, :Lexplore will change an uninitialized |g:netrw_chgwin|
	  to 2; edits will thus preferentially be made in window#2.

	  The [N] specifies a |g:netrw_winsize| just for the new :Lexplore
	  window.

	  Those who like this method often also like tree style displays;
	  see |g:netrw_liststyle|.

:[N]Lexplore! [dir] is similar to :Lexplore, except that the full-height
	  Explorer window will open on the right hand side and an
	  uninitialized |g:netrw_chgwin| will be set to 1 (eg. edits will
	  preferentially occur in the leftmost window).

	  Also see: |netrw-C|           |g:netrw_browse_split|   |g:netrw_wiw|

		    |netrw-c-tab|       |g:netrw_winsize|

						*netrw-:Sexplore*
:[N]Sexplore will always split the window before invoking the local-directory
	  browser.  As with Explore, the splitting is normally done
	  horizontally.
:[N]Sexplore! [dir] is like :Sexplore, but the splitting will be done vertically.

						*netrw-:Texplore*
:Texplore  [dir] does a |:tabnew| before generating the browser window

						*netrw-:Vexplore*
:[N]Vexplore  [dir] does an :Explore with |:leftabove|  vertical splitting.
:[N]Vexplore! [dir] does an :Explore with |:rightbelow| vertical splitting.

The optional parameters are:

 [N]: This parameter will override |g:netrw_winsize| to specify the quantity of
      rows and/or columns the new explorer window should have.
      Otherwise, the |g:netrw_winsize| variable, if it has been specified by the
      user, is used to control the quantity of rows and/or columns new
      explorer windows should have.

 [dir]: By default, these explorer commands use the current file's directory.
        However, one may explicitly provide a directory (path) to use instead;
	ie. >

	:Explore /some/path
<
						*netrw-:Rexplore*
:Rexplore  This command is a little different from the other Explore commands
	   as it doesn't necessarily open an Explorer window.

	   Return to Explorer~
	   When one edits a file using netrw which can occur, for example,
	   when pressing <cr> while the cursor is atop a filename in a netrw
	   browser window, a :Rexplore issued while editing that file will
	   return the display to that of the last netrw browser display in
	   that window.

	   Return from Explorer~
	   Conversely, when one is editing a directory, issuing a :Rexplore
	   will return to editing the file that was last edited in that
	   window.

	   The <2-leftmouse> map (which is only available under gvim and
	   cooperative terms) does the same as :Rexplore.

EXPLORING WITH STARS AND PATTERNS {{{2

When Explore, Sexplore, Hexplore, or Vexplore are used with one of the
following four patterns Explore generates a list of files which satisfy the
request for the local file system.  These exploration patterns will not work
with remote file browsing.

    */filepat	files in current directory which satisfy filepat
    **/filepat	files in current directory or below which satisfy the
		file pattern
    *//pattern	files in the current directory which contain the
		pattern (vimgrep is used)
    **//pattern	files in the current directory or below which contain
		the pattern (vimgrep is used)
<
The cursor will be placed on the first file in the list.  One may then
continue to go to subsequent files on that list via |:Nexplore| or to
preceding files on that list with |:Pexplore|.  Explore will update the
directory and place the cursor appropriately.

A plain >
	:Explore
will clear the explore list.

If your console or gui produces recognizable shift-up or shift-down sequences,
then you'll likely find using shift-downarrow and shift-uparrow convenient.
They're mapped by netrw as follows:

	<s-down>  == Nexplore, and
	<s-up>    == Pexplore.

As an example, consider
>
	:Explore */*.c
	:Nexplore
	:Nexplore
	:Pexplore
<
The status line will show, on the right hand side of the status line, a
message like "Match 3 of 20".

DISPLAYING INFORMATION ABOUT FILE				*netrw-qf* {{{2

With the cursor atop a filename, pressing "qf" will reveal the file's size
and last modification timestamp.  Currently this capability is only available
for local files.


EDIT FILE OR DIRECTORY HIDING LIST	*netrw-ctrl-h* *netrw-edithide* {{{2

The "<ctrl-h>" map brings up a requestor allowing the user to change the
file/directory hiding list contained in |g:netrw_list_hide|.  The hiding list
consists of one or more patterns delimited by commas.  Files and/or
directories satisfying these patterns will either be hidden (ie. not shown) or
be the only ones displayed (see |netrw-a|).

The "gh" mapping (see |netrw-gh|) quickly alternates between the usual
hiding list and the hiding of files or directories that begin with ".".

As an example, >
	let g:netrw_list_hide= '\(^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+'
Effectively, this makes the effect of a |netrw-gh| command the initial setting.
What it means:

	\(^\|\s\s\)   : if the line begins with the following, -or-
	                two consecutive spaces are encountered
	\zs           : start the hiding match now
	\.            : if it now begins with a dot

EDITING THE SORTING SEQUENCE		*netrw-S* *netrw-sortsequence* {{{2

When "Sorted by" is name, one may specify priority via the sorting sequence
(g:netrw_sort_sequence).  The sorting sequence typically prioritizes the
name-listing by suffix, although any pattern will do.  Patterns are delimited
by commas.  The default sorting sequence is (all one line):

For Unix: >
	'[\/]$,\<core\%(\.\d\+\)\=,\.[a-np-z]$,\.h$,\.c$,\.cpp$,*,\.o$,\.obj$,
	\.info$,\.swp$,\.bak$,\~$'
<
Otherwise: >
	'[\/]$,\.[a-np-z]$,\.h$,\.c$,\.cpp$,*,\.o$,\.obj$,\.info$,
	\.swp$,\.bak$,\~$'
<
The lone * is where all filenames not covered by one of the other patterns
will end up.  One may change the sorting sequence by modifying the
g:netrw_sort_sequence variable (either manually or in your <.vimrc>) or by
using the "S" map.

EXECUTING FILE UNDER CURSOR VIA SYSTEM()			*netrw-X* {{{2

Pressing X while the cursor is atop an executable file will yield a prompt
using the filename asking for any arguments.  Upon pressing a [return], netrw
will then call |system()| with that command and arguments.  The result will be
displayed by |:echomsg|, and so |:messages| will repeat display of the result.
Ansi escape sequences will be stripped out.

See |cmdline-window| for directions for more on how to edit the arguments.


FORCING TREATMENT AS A FILE OR DIRECTORY	*netrw-gd* *netrw-gf* {{{2

Remote symbolic links (ie. those listed via ssh or ftp) are problematic
in that it is difficult to tell whether they link to a file or to a
directory.

To force treatment as a file: use >
	gf
<
To force treatment as a directory: use >
	gd
<

GOING UP							*netrw--* {{{2

To go up a directory, press "-" or press the <cr> when atop the ../ directory
entry in the listing.

Netrw will use the command in |g:netrw_list_cmd| to perform the directory
listing operation after changing HOSTNAME to the host specified by the
user-prpvided url.  By default netrw provides the command as: >

	ssh HOSTNAME ls -FLa
<
where the HOSTNAME becomes the [user@]hostname as requested by the attempt to
read.  Naturally, the user may override this command with whatever is
preferred.  The NetList function which implements remote browsing
expects that directories will be flagged by a trailing slash.


HIDING FILES OR DIRECTORIES			*netrw-a* *netrw-hiding* {{{2

Netrw's browsing facility allows one to use the hiding list in one of three
ways: ignore it, hide files which match, and show only those files which
match.

If no files have been marked via |netrw-mf|:

The "a" map allows the user to cycle through the three hiding modes.

The |g:netrw_list_hide| variable holds a comma delimited list of patterns
based on regular expressions (ex. ^.*\.obj$,^\.) which specify the hiding list.
(also see |netrw-ctrl-h|)  To set the hiding list, use the <c-h> map.  As an
example, to hide files which begin with a ".", one may use the <c-h> map to
set the hiding list to '^\..*' (or one may put let g:netrw_list_hide= '^\..*'
in one's <.vimrc>).  One may then use the "a" key to show all files, hide
matching files, or to show only the matching files.

	Example: \.[ch]$
		This hiding list command will hide/show all *.c and *.h files.

	Example: \.c$,\.h$
		This hiding list command will also hide/show all *.c and *.h
		files.

Don't forget to use the "a" map to select the mode (normal/hiding/show) you
want!

If files have been marked using |netrw-mf|, then this command will:

  if showing all files or non-hidden files:
   modify the g:netrw_list_hide list by appending the marked files to it
   and showing only non-hidden files.

  else if showing hidden files only:
   modify the g:netrw_list_hide list by removing the marked files from it
   and showing only non-hidden files.
  endif

					*netrw-gh* *netrw-hide*
As a quick shortcut, one may press >
	gh
to toggle between hiding files which begin with a period (dot) and not hiding
them.

Associated topics: |netrw-a| |netrw-ctrl-h| |netrw-mh|

					*netrw-gitignore*
Netrw provides a helper function 'netrw_gitignore#Hide()' that, when used with
|g:netrw_list_hide| automatically hides all git-ignored files.

'netrw_gitignore#Hide' searches for patterns in the following files: >

	'./.gitignore'
	'./.git/info/exclude'
	global gitignore file: `git config --global core.excludesfile`
	system gitignore file: `git config --system core.excludesfile`
<
Files that do not exist, are ignored.
Git-ignore patterns are taken from existing files, and converted to patterns for
hiding files. For example, if you had '*.log' in your '.gitignore' file, it
would be converted to '.*\.log'.

To use this function, simply assign its output to |g:netrw_list_hide| option.  >

	Example: let g:netrw_list_hide= netrw_gitignore#Hide()
		Git-ignored files are hidden in Netrw.

	Example: let g:netrw_list_hide= netrw_gitignore#Hide('my_gitignore_file')
		Function can take additional files with git-ignore patterns.

	Example: let g:netrw_list_hide= netrw_gitignore#Hide() .. '.*\.swp$'

IMPROVING BROWSING			*netrw-listhack* *netrw-ssh-hack* {{{2

Especially with the remote directory browser, constantly entering the password
is tedious.

For Linux/Unix systems, the book "Linux Server Hacks - 100 industrial strength
tips & tools" by Rob Flickenger (O'Reilly, ISBN 0-596-00461-3) gives a tip
for setting up no-password ssh and scp and discusses associated security
issues.  It used to be available at http://hacks.oreilly.com/pub/h/66 ,
but apparently that address is now being redirected to some "hackzine".
I'll attempt a summary based on that article and on a communication from
Ben Schmidt:

	1. Generate a public/private key pair on the local machine
	   (ssh client): >
		ssh-keygen -t rsa
		(saving the file in ~/.ssh/id_rsa as prompted)
<
	2. Just hit the <CR> when asked for passphrase (twice) for no
	   passphrase.  If you do use a passphrase, you will also need to use
	   ssh-agent so you only have to type the passphrase once per session.
	   If you don't use a passphrase, simply logging onto your local
	   computer or getting access to the keyfile in any way will suffice
	   to access any ssh servers which have that key authorized for login.

	3. This creates two files: >
		~/.ssh/id_rsa
		~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
<
	4. On the target machine (ssh server): >
		cd
		mkdir -p .ssh
		chmod 0700 .ssh
<
	5. On your local machine (ssh client): (one line) >
		ssh {serverhostname}
		  cat '>>' '~/.ssh/authorized_keys2' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
<
	   or, for OpenSSH, (one line) >
		ssh {serverhostname}
		  cat '>>' '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
<
You can test it out with >
	ssh {serverhostname}
and you should be log onto the server machine without further need to type
anything.

If you decided to use a passphrase, do: >
	ssh-agent $SHELL
	ssh-add
	ssh {serverhostname}
You will be prompted for your key passphrase when you use ssh-add, but not
subsequently when you use ssh.  For use with vim, you can use >
	ssh-agent vim
and, when next within vim, use >
	:!ssh-add
Alternatively, you can apply ssh-agent to the terminal you're planning on
running vim in: >
	ssh-agent xterm &
and do ssh-add whenever you need.

For Windows, folks on the vim mailing list have mentioned that Pageant helps
with avoiding the constant need to enter the password.

Kingston Fung wrote about another way to avoid constantly needing to enter
passwords:

    In order to avoid the need to type in the password for scp each time, you
    provide a hack in the docs to set up a non password ssh account. I found a
    better way to do that: I can use a regular ssh account which uses a
    password to access the material without the need to key-in the password
    each time. It's good for security and convenience. I tried ssh public key
    authorization + ssh-agent, implementing this, and it works! Here are two
    links with instructions:

LISTING BOOKMARKS AND HISTORY		*netrw-qb* *netrw-listbookmark* {{{2

Pressing "qb" (query bookmarks) will list both the bookmarked directories and
directory traversal history.

MAKING A NEW DIRECTORY					*netrw-d* {{{2

With the "d" map one may make a new directory either remotely (which depends
on the global variable g:netrw_mkdir_cmd) or locally (which depends on the
global variable g:netrw_localmkdir).  Netrw will issue a request for the new
directory's name.  A bare <CR> at that point will abort the making of the
directory.  Attempts to make a local directory that already exists (as either
a file or a directory) will be detected, reported on, and ignored.

Related topics: |netrw-D|
Associated setting variables:	|g:netrw_localmkdir|   |g:netrw_mkdir_cmd|
				|g:netrw_remote_mkdir| |netrw-%|


MAKING THE BROWSING DIRECTORY THE CURRENT DIRECTORY	*netrw-cd* {{{2

By default, |g:netrw_keepdir| is 1.  This setting means that the current
directory will not track the browsing directory. (done for backwards
compatibility with v6's file explorer).

Setting g:netrw_keepdir to 0 tells netrw to make vim's current directory
track netrw's browsing directory.

However, given the default setting for g:netrw_keepdir of 1 where netrw
maintains its own separate notion of the current directory, in order to make
the two directories the same, use the "cd" map (type cd).  That map will
set Vim's notion of the current directory to netrw's current browsing
directory.

|netrw-cd| : This map's name was changed from "c" to cd (see |netrw-cd|).
           This change was done to allow for |netrw-cb| and |netrw-cB| maps.

Associated setting variable: |g:netrw_keepdir|

MARKING FILES					*netrw-:MF*	*netrw-mf* {{{2
	(also see |netrw-mr|)

Netrw provides several ways to mark files:

	* One may mark files with the cursor atop a filename and
	  then pressing "mf".

	* With gvim, in addition one may mark files with
	  <s-leftmouse>. (see |netrw-mouse|)

	* One may use the :MF command, which takes a list of
	  files (for local directories, the list may include
	  wildcards -- see |glob()|) >

		:MF *.c
<
	  (Note that :MF uses |<f-args>| to break the line
	  at spaces)

	* Mark files using the |argument-list| (|netrw-mA|)

	* Mark files based upon a |location-list| (|netrw-qL|)

	* Mark files based upon the quickfix list (|netrw-qF|)
	  (|quickfix-error-lists|)

The following netrw maps make use of marked files:

    |netrw-a|	Hide marked files/directories
    |netrw-D|	Delete marked files/directories
    |netrw-ma|	Move marked files' names to |arglist|
    |netrw-mA|	Move |arglist| filenames to marked file list
    |netrw-mb|	Append marked files to bookmarks
    |netrw-mB|	Delete marked files from bookmarks
    |netrw-mc|	Copy marked files to target
    |netrw-md|	Apply vimdiff to marked files
    |netrw-me|	Edit marked files
    |netrw-mF|	Unmark marked files
    |netrw-mg|	Apply vimgrep to marked files
    |netrw-mm|	Move marked files to target
    |netrw-mp|	Print marked files
    |netrw-ms|	Netrw will source marked files
    |netrw-mt|	Set target for |netrw-mm| and |netrw-mc|
    |netrw-mT|	Generate tags using marked files
    |netrw-mv|	Apply vim command to marked files
    |netrw-mx|	Apply shell command to marked files
    |netrw-mX|	Apply shell command to marked files, en bloc
    |netrw-mz|	Compress/Decompress marked files
    |netrw-O|	Obtain marked files
    |netrw-R|	Rename marked files

One may unmark files one at a time the same way one marks them; ie. place
the cursor atop a marked file and press "mf".  This process also works
with <s-leftmouse> using gvim.  One may unmark all files by pressing
"mu" (see |netrw-mu|).

Marked files are highlighted using the "netrwMarkFile" highlighting group,
which by default is linked to "Identifier" (see Identifier under
|group-name|).  You may change the highlighting group by putting something
like >

	highlight clear netrwMarkFile
	hi link netrwMarkFile ..whatever..
<
into $HOME/.vim/after/syntax/netrw.vim .

If the mouse is enabled and works with your vim, you may use <s-leftmouse> to
mark one or more files.  You may mark multiple files by dragging the shifted
leftmouse.  (see |netrw-mouse|)

			*markfilelist* *global_markfilelist* *local_markfilelist*
All marked files are entered onto the global marked file list; there is only
one such list.  In addition, every netrw buffer also has its own buffer-local
marked file list; since netrw buffers are associated with specific
directories, this means that each directory has its own local marked file
list.  The various commands which operate on marked files use one or the other
of the marked file lists.

Known Problem: if one is using tree mode (|g:netrw_liststyle|) and several
directories have files with the same name,  then marking such a file will
result in all such files being highlighted as if they were all marked.  The
|markfilelist|, however, will only have the selected file in it.  This problem
is unlikely to be fixed.


UNMARKING FILES							*netrw-mF* {{{2
	(also see |netrw-mf|, |netrw-mu|)

The "mF" command will unmark all files in the current buffer.  One may also use
mf (|netrw-mf|) on a specific, already marked, file to unmark just that file.

MARKING FILES BY LOCATION LIST					*netrw-qL* {{{2
	(also see |netrw-mf|)

One may convert |location-list|s into a marked file list using "qL".
You may then proceed with commands such as me (|netrw-me|) to edit them.


MARKING FILES BY QUICKFIX LIST					*netrw-qF* {{{2
	(also see |netrw-mf|)

One may convert |quickfix-error-lists| into a marked file list using "qF".
You may then proceed with commands such as me (|netrw-me|) to edit them.
Quickfix error lists are generated, for example, by calls to |:vimgrep|.


MARKING FILES BY REGULAR EXPRESSION				*netrw-mr* {{{2
	(also see |netrw-mf|)

One may also mark files by pressing "mr"; netrw will then issue a prompt,
"Enter regexp: ".  You may then enter a shell-style regular expression such
as *.c$ (see |glob()|).  For remote systems, glob() doesn't work -- so netrw
converts "*" into ".*" (see |regexp|) and marks files based on that.  In the
future I may make it possible to use |regexp|s instead of glob()-style
expressions (yet-another-option).

See |cmdline-window| for directions on more on how to edit the regular
expression.


MARKED FILES, ARBITRARY VIM COMMAND				*netrw-mv*  {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the local marked-file list)

The "mv" map causes netrw to execute an arbitrary vim command on each file on
the local marked file list, individually:

	* 1split
	* sil! keepalt e file
	* run vim command
	* sil! keepalt wq!

A prompt, "Enter vim command: ", will be issued to elicit the vim command you
wish used.  See |cmdline-window| for directions for more on how to edit the
command.


MARKED FILES, ARBITRARY SHELL COMMAND				*netrw-mx* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the local marked-file list)

Upon activation of the "mx" map, netrw will query the user for some (external)
command to be applied to all marked files.  All "%"s in the command will be
substituted with the name of each marked file in turn.  If no "%"s are in the
command, then the command will be followed by a space and a marked filename.

Example:
	(mark files)
	mx
	Enter command: cat

	The result is a series of shell commands:
	cat 'file1'
	cat 'file2'
	...


MARKED FILES, ARBITRARY SHELL COMMAND, EN BLOC			*netrw-mX* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked-file list)

Upon activation of the 'mX' map, netrw will query the user for some (external)
command to be applied to all marked files on the global marked file list.  The
"en bloc" means that one command will be executed on all the files at once: >

	command files

This approach is useful, for example, to select files and make a tarball: >

	(mark files)
	mX
	Enter command: tar cf mynewtarball.tar
<
The command that will be run with this example:

	tar cf mynewtarball.tar 'file1' 'file2' ...


MARKED FILES: ARGUMENT LIST				*netrw-ma* *netrw-mA*
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked-file list)

Using ma, one moves filenames from the marked file list to the argument list.
Using mA, one moves filenames from the argument list to the marked file list.

See Also: |netrw-cb| |netrw-cB| |netrw-qF| |argument-list| |:args|


MARKED FILES: BUFFER LIST				*netrw-cb* *netrw-cB*
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked-file list)

Using cb, one moves  filenames from the marked file list to the buffer list.
Using cB, one copies filenames from the buffer list to the marked file list.

See Also: |netrw-ma| |netrw-mA| |netrw-qF| |buffer-list| |:buffers|


MARKED FILES: COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION		*netrw-mz* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the local marked file list)

If any marked files are compressed,   then "mz" will decompress them.
If any marked files are decompressed, then "mz" will compress them
using the command specified by |g:netrw_compress|; by default,
that's "gzip".

For decompression, netrw uses a |Dictionary| of suffices and their
associated decompressing utilities; see |g:netrw_decompress|.

Remember that one can mark multiple files by regular expression
(see |netrw-mr|); this is particularly useful to facilitate compressing and
decompressing a large number of files.

Associated setting variables: |g:netrw_compress| |g:netrw_decompress|

MARKED FILES: COPYING						*netrw-mc* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (Uses the global marked file list)

Select a target directory with mt (|netrw-mt|).  Then change directory,
select file(s) (see |netrw-mf|), and press "mc".  The copy is done
from the current window (where one does the mf) to the target.

If one does not have a target directory set with |netrw-mt|, then netrw
will query you for a directory to copy to.

One may also copy directories and their contents (local only) to a target
directory.

Associated setting variables:
	|g:netrw_localcopycmd|		|g:netrw_localcopycmdopt|
	|g:netrw_localcopydircmd|	|g:netrw_localcopydircmdopt|
	|g:netrw_ssh_cmd|

MARKED FILES: DIFF						*netrw-md* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked file list)

Use vimdiff to visualize difference between selected files (two or
three may be selected for this).  Uses the global marked file list.

MARKED FILES: EDITING						*netrw-me* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked file list)

The "me" command will place the marked files on the |arglist| and commence
editing them.  One may return the to explorer window with |:Rexplore|.
(use |:n| and |:p| to edit next and previous files in the arglist)

MARKED FILES: GREP						*netrw-mg* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked file list)

The "mg" command will apply |:vimgrep| to the marked files.
The command will ask for the requested pattern; one may then enter: >

	/pattern/[g][j]
	! /pattern/[g][j]
	pattern
<
With /pattern/, editing will start with the first item on the |quickfix| list
that vimgrep sets up (see |:copen|, |:cnext|, |:cprevious|, |:cclose|).  The |:vimgrep|
command is in use, so without 'g' each line is added to quickfix list only
once; with 'g' every match is included.

With /pattern/j, "mg" will winnow the current marked file list to just those
marked files also possessing the specified pattern.  Thus, one may use >

	mr ...file-pattern...
	mg /pattern/j
<
to have a marked file list satisfying the file-pattern but also restricted to
files containing some desired pattern.


MARKED FILES: HIDING AND UNHIDING BY SUFFIX			*netrw-mh* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the local marked file list)

The "mh" command extracts the suffices of the marked files and toggles their
presence on the hiding list.  Please note that marking the same suffix
this way multiple times will result in the suffix's presence being toggled
for each file (so an even quantity of marked files having the same suffix
is the same as not having bothered to select them at all).

MARKED FILES: MOVING						*netrw-mm* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked file list)

	WARNING: moving files is more dangerous than copying them.
	A file being moved is first copied and then deleted; if the
	copy operation fails and the delete succeeds, you will lose
	the file.  Either try things out with unimportant files
	first or do the copy and then delete yourself using mc and D.
	Use at your own risk!

Select a target directory with mt (|netrw-mt|).  Then change directory,
select file(s) (see |netrw-mf|), and press "mm".  The move is done
from the current window (where one does the mf) to the target.

Associated setting variable: |g:netrw_localmovecmd| |g:netrw_ssh_cmd|

MARKED FILES: SOURCING						*netrw-ms* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the local marked file list)

With "ms", netrw will source the marked files (using vim's |:source| command)


MARKED FILES: SETTING THE TARGET DIRECTORY			*netrw-mt* {{{2
     (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)

Set the marked file copy/move-to target (see |netrw-mc| and |netrw-mm|):

  * If the cursor is atop a file name, then the netrw window's currently
    displayed directory is used for the copy/move-to target.

  * Also, if the cursor is in the banner, then the netrw window's currently
    displayed directory is used for the copy/move-to target.
    Unless the target already is the current directory.  In which case,
    typing "mf" clears the target.

  * However, if the cursor is atop a directory name, then that directory is
    used for the copy/move-to target

  * One may use the :MT [directory] command to set the target	*netrw-:MT*
    This command uses |<q-args>|, so spaces in the directory name are
    permitted without escaping.

  * With mouse-enabled vim or with gvim, one may select a target by using
    <c-leftmouse>

There is only one copy/move-to target at a time in a vim session; ie. the
target is a script variable (see |s:var|) and is shared between all netrw
windows (in an instance of vim).

When using menus and gvim, netrw provides a "Targets" entry which allows one
to pick a target from the list of bookmarks and history.

MARKED FILES: TAGGING						*netrw-mT* {{{2
	    (See |netrw-mf| and |netrw-mr| for how to mark files)
		      (uses the global marked file list)

The "mT" mapping will apply the command in |g:netrw_ctags| (by default, it is
"ctags") to marked files.  For remote browsing, in order to create a tags file
netrw will use ssh (see |g:netrw_ssh_cmd|), and so ssh must be available for
this to work on remote systems.  For your local system, see |ctags| on how to
get a version.  I myself use hdrtags, currently available at
http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/src/index.html , and have >

	let g:netrw_ctags= "hdrtag"
<
in my <.vimrc>.

When a remote set of files are tagged, the resulting tags file is "obtained";
ie. a copy is transferred to the local system's directory.  The now local tags
file is then modified so that one may use it through the network.  The
modification made concerns the names of the files in the tags; each filename is
preceded by the netrw-compatible URL used to obtain it.  When one subsequently
uses one of the go to tag actions (|tags|), the URL will be used by netrw to
edit the desired file and go to the tag.

Associated setting variables: |g:netrw_ctags| |g:netrw_ssh_cmd|

MARKED FILES: TARGET DIRECTORY USING BOOKMARKS		*netrw-Tb* {{{2

Sets the marked file copy/move-to target.

The |netrw-qb| map will give you a list of bookmarks (and history).
One may choose one of the bookmarks to become your marked file
target by using [count]Tb (default count: 1).

Sets the marked file copy/move-to target.

The |netrw-qb| map will give you a list of history (and bookmarks).
One may choose one of the history entries to become your marked file
target by using [count]Th (default count: 0; ie. the current directory).

MARKED FILES: UNMARKING						*netrw-mu* {{{2
     (See |netrw-mf|, |netrw-mF|)

The "mu" mapping will unmark all currently marked files.  This command differs
from "mF" as the latter only unmarks files in the current directory whereas
"mu" will unmark global and all buffer-local marked files.
(see |netrw-mF|)


				*netrw-browser-settings*
NETRW BROWSER VARIABLES		*netrw-browser-options* *netrw-browser-var* {{{2

(if you're interested in the netrw file transfer settings, see |netrw-options|

  *g:netrw_banner*		enable/suppress the banner
				=0: suppress the banner
				=1: banner is enabled (default)

  *g:netrw_bannerbackslash*	if this variable exists and is not zero, the
				banner will be displayed with backslashes
				rather than forward slashes.

  *g:netrw_browse_split*	when browsing, <cr> will open the file by:

				    horizontal splitting.
				=[servername,tab-number,window-number]
				    Given a |List| such as this, a remote server
				    named by the "servername" will be used for
				    editing.  It will also use the specified tab

  *g:netrw_clipboard*		=1
				By default, netrw will attempt to insure that
				the clipboard's values will remain unchanged.
				However, some users report that they have
				speed problems with this; consequently, this
				option, when set to zero,  lets such users
				prevent netrw from saving and restoring the
				clipboard (the latter is done only as needed).
				That means that if the clipboard is changed
				(inadvertently) by normal netrw operation that
				it will not be restored to its prior state.

  *g:netrw_compress*		="gzip"
				Will compress marked files with this

				    (default value)
				=2: fast directory browsing;
				    only obtains directory listings when the
				    directory hasn't been seen before
				    (or |netrw-ctrl-l| is used).

				Fast browsing retains old directory listing
				buffers so that they don't need to be
				re-acquired.  This feature is especially
				important for remote browsing.  However, if
				a file is introduced or deleted into or from
				such directories, the old directory buffer
				becomes out-of-date.  One may always refresh
				such a directory listing with |netrw-ctrl-l|.
				This option gives the user the choice of

  *g:netrw_ssh_browse_reject*	ssh can sometimes produce unwanted lines,
				messages, banners, and whatnot that one doesn't
				want masquerading as "directories" and "files".
				Use this pattern to remove such embedded
				messages.  By default its value is:
					 '^total\s\+\d\+$'

  *g:netrw_ssh_cmd*		One may specify an executable command
				to use instead of ssh for remote actions
				such as listing, file removal, etc.
				 default: ssh

 *g:netrw_suppress_gx_mesg*	=1 : browsers sometimes produce messages
				which are normally unwanted intermixed
				with the page.
				However, when using links, for example,
				those messages are what the browser produces.
				By setting this option to 0, netrw will not
				suppress browser messages.

  *g:netrw_tmpfile_escape*	=' &;'
				escape() is applied to all temporary files
				to escape these characters.

  *g:netrw_timefmt*		specify format string to vim's strftime().
				The default, "%c", is "the preferred date
				and time representation for the current
				locale" according to my manpage entry for
				strftime(); however, not all are satisfied
				with it.  Some alternatives:
				 "%a %d %b %Y %T",
				 " %a %Y-%m-%d  %I-%M-%S %p"
				 default: "%c"

  *g:netrw_use_noswf*		netrw normally avoids writing swapfiles
				for browser buffers.  However, under some
				systems this apparently is causing nasty
				ml_get errors to appear; if you're getting
				ml_get errors, try putting
				  let g:netrw_use_noswf= 0
				in your .vimrc.
				  default: 1

  *g:netrw_winsize*		specify initial size of new windows made with
				"o" (see |netrw-o|), "v" (see |netrw-v|),
				|:Hexplore| or |:Vexplore|.  The g:netrw_winsize
				is an integer describing the percentage of the
				current netrw buffer's window to be used for
				the new window.
				 If g:netrw_winsize is less than zero, then
				the absolute value of g:netrw_winsize will be
				used to specify the quantity of lines or
				columns for the new window.
				 If g:netrw_winsize is zero, then a normal
				split will be made (ie. |'equalalways'| will
				take effect, for example).
				 default: 50  (for 50%)

  *g:netrw_wiw*			=1 specifies the minimum window width to use
				when shrinking a netrw/Lexplore window
				(see |netrw-c-tab|).

  *g:netrw_xstrlen*		Controls how netrw computes string lengths,
				including multi-byte characters' string
				length. (thanks to N Weibull, T Mechelynck)
				=0: uses Vim's built-in strlen()
				=1: number of codepoints (Latin a + combining
				    circumflex is two codepoints)  (DEFAULT)
				=2: number of spacing codepoints (Latin a +
				    combining circumflex is one spacing
				    codepoint; a hard tab is one; wide and
				    narrow CJK are one each; etc.)
				=3: virtual length (counting tabs as anything
				    between 1 and |'tabstop'|, wide CJK as 2
				    rather than 1, Arabic alif as zero when
				    immediately preceded by lam, one
				    otherwise, etc)

  *g:NetrwTopLvlMenu*		This variable specifies the top level
				menu name; by default, it's "Netrw.".  If
				you wish to change this, do so in your
				.vimrc.

NETRW BROWSING AND OPTION INCOMPATIBILITIES	*netrw-incompatible* {{{2

Netrw has been designed to handle user options by saving them, setting the
options to something that's compatible with netrw's needs, and then restoring
them.  However, the autochdir option: >
	:set acd
is problematic.  Autochdir sets the current directory to that containing the
file you edit; this apparently also applies to directories.  In other words,
autochdir sets the current directory to that containing the "file" (even if
that "file" is itself a directory).

NETRW SETTINGS WINDOW				*netrw-settings-window* {{{2

With the NetrwSettings.vim plugin, >
	:NetrwSettings
will bring up a window with the many variables that netrw uses for its
settings.  You may change any of their values; when you save the file, the
settings therein will be used.  One may also press "?" on any of the lines for
help on what each of the variables do.

(also see: |netrw-browser-var| |netrw-protocol| |netrw-variables|)


==============================================================================
OBTAINING A FILE					*netrw-obtain* *netrw-O* {{{2

If there are no marked files:

    When browsing a remote directory, one may obtain a file under the cursor
    (ie.  get a copy on your local machine, but not edit it) by pressing the O
    key.

If there are marked files:

    The marked files will be obtained (ie. a copy will be transferred to your
    local machine, but not set up for editing).

Only ftp and scp are supported for this operation (but since these two are
available for browsing, that shouldn't be a problem).  The status bar will
then show, on its right hand side, a message like "Obtaining filename".  The
statusline will be restored after the transfer is complete.

Netrw can also "obtain" a file using the local browser.  Netrw's display
of a directory is not necessarily the same as Vim's "current directory",
unless |g:netrw_keepdir| is set to 0 in the user's <.vimrc>.  One may select
a file using the local browser (by putting the cursor on it) and pressing
"O" will then "obtain" the file; ie. copy it to Vim's current directory.

Related topics:
 * To see what the current directory is, use |:pwd|
 * To make the currently browsed directory the current directory, see
   |netrw-cd|
 * To automatically make the currently browsed directory the current
   directory, see |g:netrw_keepdir|.

					*netrw-newfile* *netrw-createfile*
OPEN A NEW FILE IN NETRW'S CURRENT DIRECTORY		*netrw-%* {{{2

To open a new file in netrw's current directory, press "%".  This map
will query the user for a new filename; an empty file by that name will
be placed in the netrw's current directory (ie. b:netrw_curdir).

If Lexplore (|netrw-:Lexplore|) is in use, the new file will be generated
in the |g:netrw_chgwin| window.

Related topics:               |netrw-d|


PREVIEW WINDOW				*netrw-p* *netrw-preview* {{{2

One may use a preview window by using the "p" key when the cursor is atop the
desired filename to be previewed.  The display will then split to show both
the browser (where the cursor will remain) and the file (see |:pedit|).  By
default, the split will be taken horizontally; one may use vertical splitting
if one has set |g:netrw_preview| first.

An interesting set of netrw settings is: >

	let g:netrw_preview   = 1
	let g:netrw_liststyle = 3
	let g:netrw_winsize   = 30

These will:

	1. Make vertical splitting the default for previewing files
	2. Make the default listing style "tree"
	3. When a vertical preview window is opened, the directory listing
	   will use only 30% of the columns available; the rest of the window
	   is used for the preview window.

	Related: if you like this idea, you may also find :Lexplore
	         (|netrw-:Lexplore|) or |g:netrw_chgwin| of interest

Also see: |g:netrw_chgwin| |netrw-P| |'previewwindow'| |CTRL-W_z| |:pclose|


PREVIOUS WINDOW					*netrw-P* *netrw-prvwin* {{{2

To edit a file or directory under the cursor in the previously used (last
accessed) window (see :he |CTRL-W_p|), press a "P".  If there's only one
window, then the one window will be horizontally split (by default).

If there's more than one window, the previous window will be re-used on
the selected file/directory.  If the previous window's associated buffer
has been modified, and there's only one window with that buffer, then
the user will be asked if they wish to save the buffer first (yes, no, or
cancel).

REFRESHING THE LISTING		*netrw-refresh* *netrw-ctrl-l* *netrw-ctrl_l* {{{2

To refresh either a local or remote directory listing, press ctrl-l (<c-l>) or
hit the <cr> when atop the ./ directory entry in the listing.  One may also
refresh a local directory by using ":e .".


REVERSING SORTING ORDER		*netrw-r* *netrw-reverse* {{{2

One may toggle between normal and reverse sorting order by pressing the
"r" key.

Associated setting variable: |g:netrw_sort_direction|


RENAMING FILES OR DIRECTORIES	*netrw-move* *netrw-rename* *netrw-R* {{{2

If there are no marked files: (see |netrw-mf|)

    Renaming files and directories involves moving the cursor to the
    file/directory to be moved (renamed) and pressing "R".  You will then be
    queried for what you want the file/directory to be renamed to.  You may
    select a range of lines with the "V" command (visual selection), and then
    press "R"; you will be queried for each file as to what you want it
    renamed to.

If there are marked files:  (see |netrw-mf|)

    Marked files will be renamed (moved).  You will be queried as above in
    order to specify where you want the file/directory to be moved.

    If you answer a renaming query with a "s/frompattern/topattern/", then
    subsequent files on the marked file list will be renamed by taking each
    name, applying that substitute, and renaming each file to the result.
    As an example : >

	mr  [query: reply with *.c]
	R   [query: reply with s/^\(.*\)\.c$/\1.cpp/]
<
    This example will mark all "*.c" files and then rename them to "*.cpp"
    files.  Netrw will protect you from overwriting local files without
    confirmation, but not remote ones.

    The ctrl-X character has special meaning for renaming files: >

	<c-x>      : a single ctrl-x tells netrw to ignore the portion of the response
	             lying between the last '/' and the ctrl-x.

	<c-x><c-x> : a pair of contiguous ctrl-x's tells netrw to ignore any
		     portion of the string preceding the double ctrl-x's.
<
    WARNING: ~

    Note that moving files is a dangerous operation; copies are safer.  That's
    because a "move" for remote files is actually a copy + delete -- and if
    the copy fails and the delete succeeds you may lose the file.
    Use at your own risk.

The *g:netrw_rename_cmd* variable is used to implement remote renaming.  By
default its value is: >

	ssh HOSTNAME mv
<
One may rename a block of files and directories by selecting them with
V (|linewise-visual|) when using thin style.

See |cmdline-editing| for more on how to edit the command line; in particular,
you'll find <ctrl-f> (initiates cmdline window editing) and <ctrl-c> (uses the
command line under the cursor) useful in conjunction with the R command.


SELECTING SORTING STYLE			*netrw-s* *netrw-sort* {{{2

One may select the sorting style by name, time, or (file) size.  The "s" map
allows one to circulate amongst the three choices; the directory listing will
automatically be refreshed to reflect the selected style.

SETTING EDITING WINDOW		*netrw-editwindow* *netrw-C* *netrw-:NetrwC* {{{2

One may select a netrw window for editing with the "C" mapping, using the
:NetrwC [win#] command, or by setting |g:netrw_chgwin| to the selected window
number.  Subsequent selection of a file to edit (|netrw-cr|) will use that
window.

	* C : by itself, will select the current window holding a netrw buffer
	  for subsequent editing via |netrw-cr|.  The C mapping is only available
	  while in netrw buffers.

	* [count]C : the count will be used as the window number to be used
	  for subsequent editing via |netrw-cr|.

	* :NetrwC will set |g:netrw_chgwin| to the current window

	* :NetrwC win#  will set |g:netrw_chgwin| to the specified window
	  number

Using >
	let g:netrw_chgwin= -1
will restore the default editing behavior
(ie. subsequent editing will use the current window).

SHRINKING OR EXPANDING A NETRW OR LEXPLORE WINDOW	*netrw-c-tab* {{{2

The <c-tab> key will toggle a netrw or |:Lexplore| window's width,
but only if |g:netrw_usetab| exists and is non-zero (and, of course,
only if your terminal supports differentiating <c-tab> from a plain
<tab>).

  * If the current window is a netrw window, toggle its width
    (between |g:netrw_wiw| and its original width)

  * Else if there is a |:Lexplore| window in the current tab, toggle
    its width

  * Else bring up a |:Lexplore| window

If |g:netrw_usetab| exists and is zero, or if there is a pre-existing mapping
for <c-tab>, then the <c-tab> will not be mapped.  One may map something other
than a <c-tab>, too: (but you'll still need to have had |g:netrw_usetab| set). >

Related topics:			|:Lexplore|
Associated setting variable:	|g:netrw_usetab|


USER SPECIFIED MAPS					*netrw-usermaps* {{{1

One may make customized user maps.  Specify a variable, |g:Netrw_UserMaps|,
to hold a |List| of lists of keymap strings and function names: >

	[["keymap-sequence","ExampleUserMapFunc"],...]
<
When netrw is setting up maps for a netrw buffer, if |g:Netrw_UserMaps|
exists, then the internal function netrw#UserMaps(islocal) is called.
This function goes through all the entries in the |g:Netrw_UserMaps| list:

	* sets up maps: >
		nno <buffer> <silent> KEYMAP-SEQUENCE
		:call s:UserMaps(islocal,"ExampleUserMapFunc")
<	* refreshes if result from that function call is the string
	  "refresh"
	* if the result string is not "", then that string will be
	  executed (:exe result)
	* if the result is a List, then the above two actions on results
	  will be taken for every string in the result List

The user function is passed one argument; it resembles >

	fun! ExampleUserMapFunc(islocal)
<
where a:islocal is 1 if its a local-directory system call or 0 when
remote-directory system call.

			        *netrw-call*  *netrw-expose*  *netrw-modify*
Use netrw#Expose("varname")          to access netrw-internal (script-local)
				     variables.
Use netrw#Modify("varname",newvalue) to change netrw-internal variables.
Use netrw#Call("funcname"[,args])    to call a netrw-internal function with
				     specified arguments.

Example: Get a copy of netrw's marked file list: >

	let netrwmarkfilelist= netrw#Expose("netrwmarkfilelist")
<
Example: Modify the value of netrw's marked file list: >

	call netrw#Modify("netrwmarkfilelist",[])

10. Problems and Fixes					*netrw-problems* {{{1

	(This section is likely to grow as I get feedback)
	(also see |netrw-debug|)
								*netrw-p1*
	P1. I use windows 95, and my ftp dumps four blank lines at the      {{{2
	    end of every read.

		See |netrw-fixup|, and put the following into your
		<.vimrc> file:

			let g:netrw_win95ftp= 1

								*netrw-p2*
	P2. I use Windows, and my network browsing with ftp doesn't sort by {{{2
	    time or size!  -or-  The remote system is a Windows server; why
	    don't I get sorts by time or size?

		Windows' ftp has a minimal support for ls (ie. it doesn't
		accept sorting options).  It doesn't support the -F which
		gives an explanatory character (ABC/ for "ABC is a directory").
		Netrw then uses "dir" to get both its thin and long listings.
		If you think your ftp does support a full-up ls, put the
		following into your <.vimrc>: >

			let g:netrw_ftp_list_cmd    = "ls -lF"
			let g:netrw_ftp_timelist_cmd= "ls -tlF"
			let g:netrw_ftp_sizelist_cmd= "ls -slF"
<
		Alternatively, if you have cygwin on your Windows box, put
		into your <.vimrc>: >

			let g:netrw_cygwin= 1
<
		This problem also occurs when the remote system is Windows.
		In this situation, the various g:netrw_ftp_[time|size]list_cmds
		are as shown above, but the remote system will not correctly
		modify its listing behavior.


								*netrw-p3*
	P3. I tried rcp://user@host/ (or protocol other than ftp) and netrw {{{2
	    used ssh!  That wasn't what I asked for...

		Netrw has two methods for browsing remote directories: ssh
		and ftp.  Unless you specify ftp specifically, ssh is used.
		When it comes time to do download a file (not just a directory
		listing), netrw will use the given protocol to do so.

								*netrw-p4*
	P4. I would like long listings to be the default.                   {{{2

		Put the following statement into your |vimrc|: >

			let g:netrw_liststyle= 1

		Check out |netrw-browser-var| for more customizations that
		you can set.

								*netrw-p5*
	P5. My times come up oddly in local browsing                        {{{2

		Does your system's strftime() accept the "%c" to yield dates
		such as "Sun Apr 27 11:49:23 1997"?  If not, do a
		"man strftime" and find out what option should be used.  Then
		put it into your |vimrc|: >

			let g:netrw_timefmt= "%X"  (where X is the option)
<
								*netrw-p6*
	P6. I want my current directory to track my browsing.               {{{2
	    How do I do that?

	    Put the following line in your |vimrc|:
>
		let g:netrw_keepdir= 0
<
								*netrw-p7*
	P7. I use Chinese (or other non-ascii) characters in my filenames,  {{{2
	    and netrw (Explore, Sexplore, Hexplore, etc) doesn't display them!

		(taken from an answer provided by Wu Yongwei on the vim
		mailing list)
		I now see the problem. Your code page is not 936, right? Vim
		seems only able to open files with names that are valid in the
		current code page, as are many other applications that do not
		use the Unicode version of Windows APIs. This is an OS-related
		issue. You should not have such problems when the system
		locale uses UTF-8, such as modern Linux distros.

		(...it is one more reason to recommend that people use utf-8!)

								*netrw-p8*
	P8. I'm getting "ssh is not executable on your system" -- what do I {{{2
	    do?

		(Dudley Fox) Most people I know use putty for windows ssh.  It
		is a free ssh/telnet application. You can read more about it
		here:

		http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ Also:

		(Marlin Unruh) This program also works for me. It's a single
		executable, so he/she can copy it into the Windows\System32
		folder and create a shortcut to it.

		(Dudley Fox) You might also wish to consider plink, as it
		sounds most similar to what you are looking for. plink is an
		application in the putty suite.

           http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter7.html#plink

		(Vissale Neang) Maybe you can try OpenSSH for windows, which
		can be obtained from:

		http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/

		It doesn't need the full Cygwin package.

		(Antoine Mechelynck) For individual Unix-like programs needed
		for work in a native-Windows environment, I recommend getting
		them from the GnuWin32 project on sourceforge if it has them:

		    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/

		Unlike Cygwin, which sets up a Unix-like virtual machine on
		top of Windows, GnuWin32 is a rewrite of Unix utilities with
		Windows system calls, and its programs works quite well in the
		cmd.exe "Dos box".

		(dave) Download WinSCP and use that to connect to the server.
		In Preferences > Editors, set gvim as your editor:

			- Click "Add..."

			- Make sure it's at the top of the listbox (click it,

		|g:netrw_rm_cmd|  |g:netrw_rmdir_cmd| |g:netrw_rmf_cmd|

	P9. I'm browsing, changing directory, and bang!  ml_get errors      {{{2

		Normally netrw attempts to avoid writing swapfiles for

								*netrw-p10*
	P10. I'm being pestered with "[something] is a directory" and       {{{2
	     "Press ENTER or type command to continue" prompts...

		The "[something] is a directory" prompt is issued by Vim,
		not by netrw, and there appears to be no way to work around
		it.  Coupled with the default cmdheight of 1, this message
		causes the "Press ENTER..." prompt.  So:  read |hit-enter|;
		I also suggest that you set your |'cmdheight'| to 2 (or more) in
		your <.vimrc> file.

								*netrw-p11*
	P11. I want to have two windows; a thin one on the left and my      {{{2
	     editing window on the right.  How may I accomplish this?

	     You probably want netrw running as in a side window.  If so, you
	     will likely find that ":[N]Lexplore" does what you want.  The
	     optional "[N]" allows you to select the quantity of columns you
	     wish the |:Lexplore|r window to start with (see |g:netrw_winsize|
	     for how this parameter works).

	     Previous solution:

		* Put the following line in your <.vimrc>:
			let g:netrw_altv = 1
		* Edit the current directory:  :e .
		* Select some file, press v
		* Resize the windows as you wish (see |CTRL-W_<| and
		  |CTRL-W_>|).  If you're using gvim, you can drag
		  the separating bar with your mouse.
		* When you want a new file, use  ctrl-w h  to go back to the
		  netrw browser, select a file, then press P  (see |CTRL-W_h|
		  and |netrw-P|).  If you're using gvim, you can press
		  <leftmouse> in the browser window and then press the
		  <middlemouse> to select the file.

	P12. My directory isn't sorting correctly, or unwanted letters are  {{{2
	     appearing in the listed filenames, or things aren't lining
	     up properly in the wide listing, ...

	     This may be due to an encoding problem.  I myself usually use
	     utf-8, but really only use ascii (ie. bytes from 32-126).
	     Multibyte encodings use two (or more) bytes per character.
	     You may need to change |g:netrw_sepchr| and/or |g:netrw_xstrlen|.

								*netrw-p13*
	P13. I'm a Windows + putty + ssh user, and when I attempt to        {{{2
	     browse, the directories are missing trailing "/"s so netrw treats
	     them as file transfers instead of as attempts to browse
	     subdirectories.  How may I fix this?

	     (mikeyao) If you want to use vim via ssh and putty under Windows,
	     try combining the use of pscp/psftp with plink.  pscp/psftp will
	     be used to connect and plink will be used to execute commands on
	     the server, for example: list files and directory using 'ls'.

	     These are the settings I use to do this:
>
	    " list files, it's the key setting, if you haven't set,
	    " you will get a blank buffer
	    let g:netrw_list_cmd = "plink HOSTNAME ls -Fa"
	    " if you haven't add putty directory in system path, you should
	    " specify scp/sftp command.  For examples:
	    "let g:netrw_sftp_cmd = "d:\\dev\\putty\\PSFTP.exe"

	P14. I would like to speed up writes using Nwrite and scp/ssh       {{{2
	     style connections.  How?  (Thomer M. Gil)

	     Try using ssh's ControlMaster and ControlPath (see the ssh_config
	     man page) to share multiple ssh connections over a single network
	     connection. That cuts out the cryptographic handshake on each
	     file write, sometimes speeding it up by an order of magnitude.
	     (see  http://thomer.com/howtos/netrw_ssh.html)
	     (included by permission)

	     What's wrong?

	     Netrw uses several system level commands to do things (see

		 |g:netrw_localcopycmd|, |g:netrw_localmovecmd|,
		 |g:netrw_localrmdir|, |g:netrw_mkdir_cmd|).

	    You may need to adjust the default commands for one or more of
	    these commands by setting them properly in your .vimrc.  Another
	    source of difficulty is that these commands use vim's local
	    directory, which may not be the same as the browsing directory
	    shown by netrw (see |g:netrw_keepdir|).


==============================================================================
11. Debugging Netrw Itself				*netrw-debug* {{{1

Step 1: check that the problem you've encountered hasn't already been resolved
by obtaining a copy of the latest (often developmental) netrw at:

	http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#NETRW

The <netrw.vim> script is typically installed on systems as something like:
>
	/usr/local/share/vim/vim8x/plugin/netrwPlugin.vim
	/usr/local/share/vim/vim8x/autoload/netrw.vim
		(see output of :echo &rtp)
<
which is loaded automatically at startup (assuming :set nocp).  If you
installed a new netrw, then it will be located at >

	$HOME/.vim/plugin/netrwPlugin.vim
	$HOME/.vim/autoload/netrw.vim
<
Step 2: assuming that you've installed the latest version of netrw,
check that your problem is really due to netrw.  Create a file
called netrw.vimrc with the following contents: >

	set nocp
	so $HOME/.vim/plugin/netrwPlugin.vim
<
Then run netrw as follows: >

	vim -u netrw.vimrc --noplugins -i NONE [some path here]
<
Perform whatever netrw commands you need to, and check that the problem is
still present.  This procedure sidesteps any issues due to personal .vimrc
settings, .viminfo file, and other plugins.  If the problem does not appear,
then you need to determine which setting in your .vimrc is causing the
conflict with netrw or which plugin(s) is/are involved.

Step 3: If the problem still is present, then get a debugging trace from
netrw:

	1. Get the <Decho.vim> script, available as:

	     http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#DECHO
	   or
	     http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=120

	  Decho.vim is provided as a "vimball".  You
	  should edit the Decho.vba.gz file and source it in: >

		vim Decho.vba.gz
		:so %
		:q
<
	2. To turn on debug tracing in netrw, then edit the <netrw.vim>
	   file by typing: >

		vim netrw.vim
		:DechoOn
		:wq
<
	   To restore to normal non-debugging behavior, re-edit <netrw.vim>
	   and type >

		vim netrw.vim
		:DechoOff
		:wq
<
	   This command, provided by <Decho.vim>, will comment out all
	   Decho-debugging statements (Dfunc(), Dret(), Decho(), Dredir()).

	3. Then bring up vim and attempt to evoke the problem by doing a
	   transfer or doing some browsing.  A set of messages should appear
	   concerning the steps that <netrw.vim> took in attempting to
	   read/write your file over the network in a separate tab or
	   server vim window.

	   Change the netrw.vimrc file to include the Decho plugin: >

		set nocp
		so $HOME/.vim/plugin/Decho.vim
		so $HOME/.vim/plugin/netrwPlugin.vim
<
	   You should continue to run vim with >

		vim -u netrw.vimrc --noplugins -i NONE [some path here]
<
	   to avoid entanglements with options and other plugins.

	   To save the file: under linux, the output will be in a separate
	   remote server window; in it, just save the file with >

		:w! DBG

<	   Under a vim that doesn't support clientserver, your debugging
	   output will appear in another tab: >

		:tabnext
		:set bt=
		:w! DBG
<
	   Furthermore, it'd be helpful if you would type >

		:Dsep <command>

<	   where <command> is the command you're about to type next,
	   thereby making it easier to associate which part of the
	   debugging trace is due to which command.

	   Please send that information to <netrw.vim>'s maintainer along
	   with the o/s you're using and the vim version that you're using
	   (see |:version|)  (remove the embedded NOSPAM first) >

==============================================================================
12. History						*netrw-history* {{{1

	v172:	Apr 22, 2023	* removed g:netrw_localrmdiropt
				  removed g:netrw_localrmdir
	v171:	Oct 09, 2020	* included code in s:NetrwOptionsSafe()
				  to allow |'bh'| to be set to delete when
				  rather than hide when g:netrw_fastbrowse
				  was zero.
				* Installed |g:netrw_clipboard| setting
				* Installed option bypass for |'guioptions'|
				  a/A settings
				* Changed popup_beval() to popup_atcursor()
				  in netrw#ErrorMsg (lacygoill). Apparently
				  popup_beval doesn't reliably close the
				  popup when the mouse is moved.
				* VimEnter() now using win_execute to examine
				  buffers for an attempt to open a directory.
				  Avoids issues with popups/terminal from
				  command line. (lacygoill)
		Jun 28, 2021	* (zeertzjq) provided a patch for use of
				  xmap,xno instead of vmap,vno in
				  netrwPlugin.vim. Avoids entanglement with
				  select mode.
		Jul 14, 2021	* Fixed problem addressed by tst976; opening
				  a file using tree mode, going up a
				  directory, and opening a file there was
				  opening the file in the wrong directory.
		Jul 28, 2021	* (Ingo Karkat) provided a patch fixing an
				  E488 error with netrwPlugin.vim
				  (occurred for vim versions < 8.02)
	v170:	Mar 11, 2020	* (reported by Reiner Herrmann) netrw+tree
				  would not hide with the ^\..* pattern
				  correctly.
				* (Marcin Szamotulski) NetrwOptionRestore
				  did not restore options correctly that
				  had a single quote in the option string.
		Apr 13, 2020	* implemented error handling via popup
				  windows (see popup_beval())
		Apr 30, 2020	* (reported by Manatsu Takahashi) while
				  using Lexplore, a modified file could
				  be overwritten.  Sol'n: will not overwrite,
				  but will emit an |E37| (although one cannot
				  add an ! to override)
		Jun 07, 2020	* (reported by Jo Totland) repeatedly invoking
				  :Lexplore and quitting it left unused
				  hidden buffers.  Netrw will now set netrw
				  buffers created by :Lexplore to |'bh'|=wipe.
	v169:	Dec 20, 2019	* (reported by amkarthik) that netrw's x
				  (|netrw-x|) would throw an error when
				  attempting to open a local directory.
	v168:	Dec 12, 2019	* scp timeout error message not reported,
				  hopefully now fixed (Shane Xb Qian)
	v167:	Nov 29, 2019	* netrw does a save&restore on @* and @+.
				  That causes problems with the clipboard.
				  Now restores occurs only if @* or @+ have
				  been changed.
				* netrw will change @* or @+ less often.
				  Never if I happen to have caught all the
				  operations that modify the unnamed
				  register (which also writes @*).
				* Modified hiding behavior so that "s"
				  will not ignore hiding.
	v166:	Nov 06, 2019	* Removed a space from a nmap for "-"
				* Numerous debugging statement changes
	v163:	Dec 05, 2017	* (Cristi Balan) reported that a setting ('sel')
				  was left changed
				* (Holger Mitschke) reported a problem with
				  saving and restoring history.  Fixed.
				* Hopefully I fixed a nasty bug that caused a
				  file rename to wipe out a buffer that it
				  should not have wiped out.
				* (Holger Mitschke) amended this help file
				  with additional |g:netrw_special_syntax|
				  items
				* Prioritized wget over curl for
				  g:netrw_http_cmd
	v162:	Sep 19, 2016	* (haya14busa) pointed out two syntax errors
				  with a patch; these are now fixed.
		Oct 26, 2016	* I started using mate-terminal and found that
				  x and gx (|netrw-x| and |netrw-gx|) were no
				  longer working.  Fixed (using atril when
				  $DESKTOP_SESSION is "mate").
		Nov 04, 2016	* (Martin Vuille) pointed out that @+ was
				  being restored with keepregstar rather than
				  keepregplus.
		Nov 09, 2016	* Broke apart the command from the options,
				  mostly for Windows.  Introduced new netrw
				  settings: |g:netrw_localcopycmdopt|
				  |g:netrw_localcopydircmdopt|
				  |g:netrw_localmkdiropt|
				  |g:netrw_localmovecmdopt|
				  g:netrw_localrmdiropt
		Nov 21, 2016	* (mattn) provided a patch for preview; swapped
				  winwidth() with winheight()
		Nov 22, 2016	* (glacambre) reported that files containing
				  spaces weren't being obtained properly via
				  scp.  Fix: apparently using single quotes
				  such as with "file name" wasn't enough; the
				  spaces inside the quotes also had to be
				  escaped (ie. "file\ name").
				* Also fixed obtain (|netrw-O|) to be able to
				  obtain files with spaces in their names
		Dec 20, 2016	* (xc1427) Reported that using "I" (|netrw-I|)
				  when atop "Hiding" in the banner also caused
				  the active-banner hiding control to occur
		Jan 03, 2017	* (Enno Nagel) reported that attempting to
				  apply netrw to a directory that was without
				  read permission caused a syntax error.
		Jan 13, 2017	* (Ingo Karkat) provided a patch which makes
				  using netrw#Call() better.  Now returns
				  value of internal routines return, for example.
		Jan 13, 2017	* (Ingo Karkat) changed netrw#FileUrlRead to
				  use |:edit| instead of |:read|.  I also
				  changed the routine name to netrw#FileUrlEdit.
		Jan 16, 2017	* (Sayem) reported a problem where :Lexplore
				  could generate a new listing buffer and
				  window instead of toggling the netrw display.
				  Unfortunately, the directions for eliciting
				  the problem weren't complete, so I may or
				  may not have fixed that issue.
		Feb 06, 2017	* Implemented cb and cB.  Changed "c" to "cd".
				  (see |netrw-cb|, |netrw-cB|, and |netrw-cd|)
		Mar 21, 2017	* previously, netrw would specify (safe) settings
				  even when the setting was already safe for
				  netrw.  Netrw now attempts to leave such
				  already-netrw-safe settings alone.
				  (affects s:NetrwOptionRestore() and
				  s:NetrwSafeOptions(); also introduced
				  s:NetrwRestoreSetting())
		Jun 26, 2017	* (Christian Brabandt) provided a patch to
				  allow curl to follow redirects (ie. -L
				  option)
		Jun 26, 2017	* (Callum Howard) reported a problem with
				  :Lexpore not removing the Lexplore window
				  after a change-directory
		Aug 30, 2017	* (Ingo Karkat) one cannot switch to the
				  previously edited file (e.g. with CTRL-^)
				  after editing a file:// URL.  Patch to
				  have a "keepalt" included.
		Oct 17, 2017	* (Adam Faryna) reported that gn (|netrw-gn|)
				  did not work on directories in the current
				  tree
	v157:	Apr 20, 2016	* (Nicola) had set up a "nmap <expr> ..." with
				  a function that returned a 0 while silently
				  invoking a shell command.  The shell command
				  activated a ShellCmdPost event which in turn
				  called s:LocalBrowseRefresh().  That looks
				  over all netrw buffers for changes needing
				  refreshes.  However, inside a |:map-<expr>|,
				  tab and window changes are disallowed.  Fixed.
				  (affects netrw's s:LocalBrowseRefresh())
				* |g:netrw_localrmdir| not used any more, but
				  the relevant patch that causes |delete()| to
				  take over was #1107 (not #1109).
				* |expand()| is now used on |g:netrw_home|;
				  consequently, g:netrw_home may now use
				  environment variables
				* s:NetrwLeftmouse and s:NetrwCLeftmouse will
				  return without doing anything if invoked
				  when inside a non-netrw window
		Jun 15, 2016	* gx now calls netrw#GX() which returns
				  the word under the cursor.  The new
				  wrinkle: if one is in a netrw buffer,
				  then netrw's s:NetrwGetWord().
		Jun 22, 2016	* Netrw was executing all its associated
				  Filetype commands silently; I'm going
				  to try doing that "noisily" and see if
				  folks have a problem with that.
		Aug 12, 2016	* Changed order of tool selection for
				  handling http://... viewing.
				  (Nikolay Aleksandrovich Pavlov)
		Aug 21, 2016	* Included hiding/showing/all for tree
				  listings
				* Fixed refresh (^L) for tree listings
	v156:	Feb 18, 2016	* Changed =~ to =~# where appropriate
		Feb 23, 2016	* s:ComposePath(base,subdir) now uses
				  fnameescape() on the base portion
		Mar 01, 2016	* (gt_macki) reported where :Explore would
				  make file unlisted. Fixed (tst943)
		Apr 04, 2016	* (reported by John Little) netrw normally
				  suppresses browser messages, but sometimes
				  those "messages" are what is wanted.
				  See |g:netrw_suppress_gx_mesg|
		Apr 06, 2016	* (reported by Carlos Pita) deleting a remote
				  file was giving an error message.  Fixed.
		Apr 08, 2016	* (Charles Cooper) had a problem with an
				  undefined b:netrw_curdir.  He also provided
				  a fix.
		Apr 20, 2016	* Changed s:NetrwGetBuffer(); now uses
				  dictionaries.  Also fixed the "No Name"
				  buffer problem.
	v155:	Oct 29, 2015	* (Timur Fayzrakhmanov) reported that netrw's
				  mapping of ctrl-l was not allowing refresh of
				  other windows when it was done in a netrw
				  window.
		Nov 05, 2015	* Improved s:TreeSqueezeDir() to use search()
				  instead of a loop
				* NetrwBrowse() will return line to
				  w:netrw_bannercnt if cursor ended up in
				  banner
		Nov 16, 2015	* Added a <Plug>NetrwTreeSqueeze (|netrw-s-cr|)
		Nov 17, 2015	* Commented out imaps -- perhaps someone can
				  tell me how they're useful and should be
				  retained?
		Nov 20, 2015	* Added |netrw-ma| and |netrw-mA| support
		Nov 20, 2015	* gx (|netrw-gx|) on a URL downloaded the
				  file in addition to simply bringing up the
				  URL in a browser.  Fixed.
		Nov 23, 2015	* Added |g:netrw_sizestyle| support
		Nov 27, 2015	* Inserted a lot of <c-u>s into various netrw
				  maps.
		Jan 05, 2016	* |netrw-qL| implemented to mark files based
				  upon |location-list|s; similar to |netrw-qF|.
		Jan 19, 2016	* using - call delete(directoryname,"d") -
				  instead of using g:netrw_localrmdir if
				  v7.4 + patch#1107 is available
		Jan 28, 2016	* changed to using |winsaveview()| and
				  |winrestview()|
		Jan 28, 2016	* s:NetrwTreePath() now does a save and
				  restore of view
		Feb 08, 2016	* Fixed a tree-listing problem with remote
				  directories
	v154:	Feb 26, 2015	* (Yuri Kanivetsky) reported a situation where
				  a file was not treated properly as a file
				  due to g:netrw_keepdir == 1
		Mar 25, 2015	* (requested by Ben Friz) one may now sort by
				  extension
		Mar 28, 2015	* (requested by Matt Brooks) netrw has a lot
				  of buffer-local mappings; however, some
				  plugins (such as vim-surround) set up
				  conflicting mappings that cause vim to wait.
				  The "<nowait>" modifier has been included
				  with most of netrw's mappings to avoid that
				  delay.
		Jun 26, 2015	* |netrw-gn| mapping implemented
				* :Ntree NotADir resulted in having
				  the tree listing expand in the error messages
				  window.  Fixed.
		Jun 29, 2015	* Attempting to delete a file remotely caused
				  an error with "keepsol" mentioned; fixed.
		Jul 08, 2015	* Several changes to keep the |:jumps| table
				  correct when working with
				  |g:netrw_fastbrowse| set to 2
				* wide listing with accented characters fixed
				  (using %-S instead of %-s with a |printf()|
		Jul 13, 2015	* (Daniel Hahler) CheckIfKde() could be true
				  but kfmclient not installed.  Changed order
				  in netrw#BrowseX(): checks if kde and
				  kfmclient, then will use xdg-open on a unix
				  system (if xdg-open is executable)
		Aug 11, 2015	* (McDonnell) tree listing mode wouldn't
				  select a file in a open subdirectory.
				* (McDonnell) when multiple subdirectories
				  were concurrently open in tree listing
				  mode, a ctrl-L wouldn't refresh properly.
				* The netrw:target menu showed duplicate
				  entries
		Oct 13, 2015	* (mattn) provided an exception to handle
				  windows with shellslash set but no shell
		Oct 23, 2015	* if g:netrw_usetab and <c-tab> now used
				  to control whether NetrwShrink is used
				  (see |netrw-c-tab|)
	v153:	May 13, 2014	* added another |g:netrw_ffkeep| usage {{{2
		May 14, 2014	* changed s:PerformListing() so that it
				  always sets ft=netrw for netrw buffers
				  (ie. even when syntax highlighting is
				  off, not available, etc)
		May 16, 2014	* introduced the |netrw-ctrl-r| functionality
		May 17, 2014	* introduced the |netrw-:NetrwMB| functionality
				* mb and mB (|netrw-mb|, |netrw-mB|) will
				  add/remove marked files from bookmark list
		May 20, 2014	* (Enno Nagel) reported that :Lex <dirname>
				  wasn't working.  Fixed.
		May 26, 2014	* restored test to prevent leftmouse window
				  resizing from causing refresh.
				  (see s:NetrwLeftmouse())
				* fixed problem where a refresh caused cursor
				  to go just under the banner instead of
				  staying put
		May 28, 2014	* (László Bimba) provided a patch for opening
				  the |:Lexplore| window 100% high, optionally
				  on the right, and will work with remote
				  files.
		May 29, 2014	* implemented :NetrwC  (see |netrw-:NetrwC|)
		Jun 01, 2014	* Removed some "silent"s from commands used
				  to implemented scp://... and pscp://...
				  directory listing.  Permits request for
				  password to appear.
		Jun 05, 2014	* (Enno Nagel) reported that user maps "/"
				  caused problems with "b" and "w", which
				  are mapped (for wide listings only) to
				  skip over files rather than just words.
		Jun 10, 2014	* |g:netrw_gx| introduced to allow users to
				  override default "<cfile>" with the gx
				  (|netrw-gx|) map
		Jun 11, 2014	* gx (|netrw-gx|), with |'autowrite'| set,
				  will write modified files.  s:NetrwBrowseX()
				  will now save, turn off, and restore the
				  |'autowrite'| setting.
		Jun 13, 2014	* added visual map for gx use
		Jun 15, 2014	* (Enno Nagel) reported that with having hls
				  set and wide listing style in use, that the
				  b and w maps caused unwanted highlighting.
		Jul 05, 2014	* |netrw-mv| and |netrw-mX| commands included
		Jul 09, 2014	* |g:netrw_keepj| included, allowing optional
				  keepj
		Jul 09, 2014	* fixing bugs due to previous update
		Jul 21, 2014	* (Bruno Sutic) provided an updated
				  netrw_gitignore.vim
		Jul 30, 2014	* (Yavuz Yetim) reported that editing two
				  remote files of the same name caused the
				  second instance to have a "temporary"
				  name.  Fixed: now they use the same buffer.
		Sep 18, 2014	* (Yasuhiro Matsumoto) provided a patch which
				  allows scp and windows local paths to work.
		Oct 07, 2014	* gx (see |netrw-gx|) when atop a directory,
				  will now do |gf| instead
		Nov 06, 2014	* For cygwin: cygstart will be available for
				  netrw#BrowseX() to use if its executable.
		Nov 07, 2014	* Began support for file://... urls.  Will use
				  |g:netrw_file_cmd| (typically elinks or links)
		Dec 02, 2014	* began work on having mc (|netrw-mc|) copy
				  directories.  Works for linux machines,
				  cygwin+vim, but not for windows+gvim.
		Dec 02, 2014	* in tree mode, netrw was not opening
				  directories via symbolic links.
		Dec 02, 2014	* added resolved link information to
				  thin and tree modes
		Dec 30, 2014	* (issue#231) |:ls| was not showing
				  remote-file buffers reliably.  Fixed.
	v152:	Apr 08, 2014	* uses the |'noswapfile'| option (requires {{{2
				  vim 7.4 with patch 213)
				* (Enno Nagel) turn |'rnu'| off in netrw
				  buffers.
				* (Quinn Strahl) suggested that netrw
				  allow regular window splitting to occur,
				  thereby allowing |'equalalways'| to take
				  effect.
				* (qingtian zhao) normally, netrw will
				  save and restore the |'fileformat'|;
				  however, sometimes that isn't wanted
		Apr 14, 2014	* whenever netrw marks a buffer as ro,
				  it will also mark it as nomod.
		Apr 16, 2014	* sftp protocol now supported by
				  netrw#Obtain(); this means that one
				  may use "mc" to copy a remote file
				  to a local file using sftp, and that
				  the |netrw-O| command can obtain remote
				  files via sftp.
				* added [count]C support (see |netrw-C|)
		Apr 18, 2014	* when |g:netrw_chgwin| is one more than
				  the last window, then vertically split
				  the last window and use it as the
				  chgwin window.
		May 09, 2014	* SavePosn was "saving filename under cursor"
				  from a non-netrw window when using :Rex.
	v151:	Jan 22, 2014	* extended :Rexplore to return to buffer {{{2
				  prior to Explore or editing a directory
				* (Ken Takata) netrw gave error when
				  clipboard was disabled.  Sol'n: Placed
				  several if has("clipboard") tests in.
				* Fixed ftp://X@Y@Z// problem; X@Y now
				  part of user id, and only Z is part of
				  hostname.
				* (A Loumiotis) reported that completion
				  using a directory name containing spaces
				  did not work.  Fixed with a retry in
				  netrw#Explore() which removes the
				  backslashes vim inserted.
		Feb 26, 2014	* :Rexplore now records the current file
				   using w:netrw_rexfile when returning via
				  |:Rexplore|
		Mar 08, 2014	* (David Kotchan) provided some patches
				  allowing netrw to work properly with
				  windows shares.
				* Multiple one-liner help messages available
				  by pressing <cr> while atop the "Quick
				  Help" line
				* worked on ShellCmdPost, FocusGained event
				  handling.
				* |:Lexplore| path: will be used to update
				  a left-side netrw browsing directory.
		Mar 12, 2014	* |netrw-s-cr|: use <s-cr>  to close
				  tree directory implemented
		Mar 13, 2014	* (Tony Mechylynck) reported that using
				  the browser with ftp on a directory,
				  and selecting a gzipped txt file, that
				  an E19 occurred (which was issued by
				  gzip.vim).  Fixed.
		Mar 14, 2014	* Implemented :MF and :MT (see |netrw-:MF|
				  and |netrw-:MT|, respectively)
		Mar 17, 2014	* |:Ntree| [dir] wasn't working properly; fixed
		Mar 18, 2014	* Changed all uses of set to setl
		Mar 18, 2014	* Commented the netrw_btkeep line in
				  s:NetrwOptionSave(); the effect is that
				  netrw buffers will remain as |'bt'|=nofile.
				  This should prevent swapfiles being created
				  for netrw buffers.
		Mar 20, 2014	* Changed all uses of lcd to use s:NetrwLcd()
				  instead.  Consistent error handling results
				  and it also handles Window's shares
				* Fixed |netrw-d| command when applied with ftp
				* https: support included for netrw#NetRead()
	v150:	Jul 12, 2013	* removed a "keepalt" to allow ":e #" to {{{2
				  return to the netrw directory listing
		Jul 13, 2013	* (Jonas Diemer) suggested changing
				  a <cWORD> to <cfile>.
		Jul 21, 2013	* (Yuri Kanivetsky) reported that netrw's
				  use of mkdir did not produce directories
				  following the user's umask.
		Aug 27, 2013	* introduced |g:netrw_altfile| option
		Sep 05, 2013	* s:Strlen() now uses |strdisplaywidth()|
				  when available, by default
		Sep 12, 2013	* (Selyano Baldo) reported that netrw wasn't
				  opening some directories properly from the
				  command line.
		Nov 09, 2013	* |:Lexplore| introduced
				* (Ondrej Platek) reported an issue with
				  netrw's trees (P15).  Fixed.
				* (Jorge Solis) reported that "t" in
				  tree mode caused netrw to forget its
				  line position.
		Dec 05, 2013	* Added <s-leftmouse> file marking
				  (see |netrw-mf|)
		Dec 05, 2013	* (Yasuhiro Matsumoto) Explore should use
				  strlen() instead s:Strlen() when handling
				  multibyte chars with strpart()
				  (ie. strpart() is byte oriented, not
				  display-width oriented).
		Dec 09, 2013	* (Ken Takata) Provided a patch; File sizes
				  and a portion of timestamps were wrongly
				  highlighted with the directory color when
				  setting `:let g:netrw_liststyle=1` on Windows.
				* (Paul Domaskis) noted that sometimes
				  cursorline was activating in non-netrw
				  windows.  All but one setting of cursorline
				  was done via setl; there was one that was
				  overlooked.  Fixed.
		Dec 24, 2013	* (esquifit) asked that netrw allow the
				  /cygdrive prefix be a user-alterable
				  parameter.
		Jan 02, 2014	* Fixed a problem with netrw-based balloon
				  evaluation (ie. netrw#NetrwBalloonHelp()
				  not having been loaded error messages)
		Jan 03, 2014	* Fixed a problem with tree listings
				* New command installed: |:Ntree|
		Jan 06, 2014	* (Ivan Brennan) reported a problem with
				  |netrw-P|.  Fixed.
		Jan 06, 2014	* Fixed a problem with |netrw-P| when the
				  modified file was to be abandoned.
		Jan 15, 2014	* (Matteo Cavalleri) reported that when the
				  banner is suppressed and tree listing is
				  used, a blank line was left at the top of
				  the display.  Fixed.
		Jan 20, 2014	* (Gideon Go) reported that, in tree listing
				  style, with a previous window open, that
				  the wrong directory was being used to open
				  a file.  Fixed. (P21)
	v149:	Apr 18, 2013	* in wide listing format, now have maps for {{{2
				  w and b to move to next/previous file
		Apr 26, 2013	* one may now copy files in the same
				  directory; netrw will issue requests for
				  what names the files should be copied under
		Apr 29, 2013	* Trying Benzinger's problem again.  Seems
				  that commenting out the BufEnter and
				  installing VimEnter (only) works.  Weird
				  problem!  (tree listing, vim -O Dir1 Dir2)
		May 01, 2013	* :Explore ftp://... wasn't working.  Fixed.
		May 02, 2013	* introduced |g:netrw_bannerbackslash| as
				  requested by Paul Domaskis.
		Jul 03, 2013	* Explore now avoids splitting when a buffer
				  will be hidden.
	v148:	Apr 16, 2013	* changed Netrw's Style menu to allow direct {{{2
				  choice of listing style, hiding style, and
				  sorting style
