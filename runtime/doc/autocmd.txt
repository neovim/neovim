Automatic commands					*autocmd* *autocommand*

For a basic explanation, see section |40.3| in the user manual.

				      Type |gO| to see the table of contents.

==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*autocmd-intro*

You can specify commands to be executed automatically when reading or writing
a file, when entering or leaving a buffer or window, and when exiting Vim.
For example, you can create an autocommand to set the 'cindent' option for
files matching *.c.  You can also use autocommands to implement advanced
features, such as editing compressed files (see |gzip-example|).  The usual
place to put autocommands is in your vimrc file.

				*E203* *E204* *E143* *E855* *E937* *E952*
WARNING: Using autocommands is very powerful, and may lead to unexpected side
effects.  Be careful not to destroy your text.
- It's a good idea to do some testing on an expendable copy of a file first.
  For example: If you use autocommands to decompress a file when starting to
  edit it, make sure that the autocommands for compressing when writing work
  correctly.
- Be prepared for an error halfway through (e.g., disk full).  Vim will mostly
  be able to undo the changes to the buffer, but you may have to clean up the
  changes to other files by hand (e.g., compress a file that has been
  decompressed).
- If the BufRead* events allow you to edit a compressed file, the FileRead*
  events should do the same (this makes recovery possible in some rare cases).
  It's a good idea to use the same autocommands for the File* and Buf* events
  when possible.

==============================================================================
2. Defining autocommands				*autocmd-define*

							*:au* *:autocmd*
:au[tocmd] [group] {event} {pat} [++once] [++nested] {cmd}
			Add {cmd} to the list of commands that Vim will
			execute automatically on {event} for a file matching
			{pat} |autocmd-patterns|.
			Note: A quote character is seen as argument to the
			:autocmd and won't start a comment.
			Nvim always adds {cmd} after existing autocommands so
			they execute in the order in which they were defined.
			See |autocmd-nested| for [++nested].
							*autocmd-once*
			If [++once] is supplied the command is executed once,
			then removed ("one shot").

The special pattern <buffer> or <buffer=N> defines a buffer-local autocommand.
See |autocmd-buflocal|.

Note: The ":autocmd" command can only be followed by another command when the
'|' appears before {cmd}.  This works: >
	:augroup mine | au! BufRead | augroup END
But this sees "augroup" as part of the defined command: >
	:augroup mine | au! BufRead * | augroup END
	:augroup mine | au BufRead * set tw=70 | augroup END
Instead you can put the group name into the command: >
	:au! mine BufRead *
	:au mine BufRead * set tw=70
Or use `:execute`: >
	:augroup mine | exe "au! BufRead *" | augroup END
	:augroup mine | exe "au BufRead * set tw=70" | augroup END

Note that special characters (e.g., "%", "<cword>") in the ":autocmd"
arguments are not expanded when the autocommand is defined.  These will be
expanded when the Event is recognized, and the {cmd} is executed.  The only
exception is that "<sfile>" is expanded when the autocmd is defined.  Example:
>
	:au BufNewFile,BufRead *.html so <sfile>:h/html.vim

Here Vim expands <sfile> to the name of the file containing this line.

`:autocmd` adds to the list of autocommands regardless of whether they are
already present.  When your .vimrc file is sourced twice, the autocommands
will appear twice.  To avoid this, define your autocommands in a group, so
that you can easily clear them: >

	augroup vimrc
	  " Remove all vimrc autocommands
	  autocmd!
	  au BufNewFile,BufRead *.html so <sfile>:h/html.vim
	augroup END

If you don't want to remove all autocommands, you can instead use a variable
to ensure that Vim includes the autocommands only once: >

	:if !exists("autocommands_loaded")
	:  let autocommands_loaded = 1
	:  au ...
	:endif

When the [group] argument is not given, Vim uses the current group (as defined
with ":augroup"); otherwise, Vim uses the group defined with [group].  Note
that [group] must have been defined before.  You cannot define a new group
with ":au group ..."; use ":augroup" for that.

While testing autocommands, you might find the 'verbose' option to be useful: >
	:set verbose=9
This setting makes Vim echo the autocommands as it executes them.

When defining an autocommand in a script, it will be able to call functions
local to the script and use mappings local to the script.  When the event is
triggered and the command executed, it will run in the context of the script
it was defined in.  This matters if |<SID>| is used in a command.

When executing the commands, the message from one command overwrites a
previous message.  This is different from when executing the commands
manually.  Mostly the screen will not scroll up, thus there is no hit-enter
prompt.  When one command outputs two messages this can happen anyway.

==============================================================================
3. Removing autocommands				*autocmd-remove*

:au[tocmd]! [group] {event} {pat} [++once] [++nested] {cmd}
			Remove all autocommands associated with {event} and
			{pat}, and add the command {cmd}.
			See |autocmd-once| for [++once].
			See |autocmd-nested| for [++nested].

:au[tocmd]! [group] {event} {pat}
			Remove all autocommands associated with {event} and
			{pat}.

:au[tocmd]! [group] * {pat}
			Remove all autocommands associated with {pat} for all
			events.

:au[tocmd]! [group] {event}
			Remove ALL autocommands for {event}.
			Warning: You should not do this without a group for
			|BufRead| and other common events, it can break
			plugins, syntax highlighting, etc.

:au[tocmd]! [group]	Remove ALL autocommands.
			Note: a quote will be seen as argument to the :autocmd
			and won't start a comment.
			Warning: You should normally not do this without a
			group, it breaks plugins, syntax highlighting, etc.

When the [group] argument is not given, Vim uses the current group (as defined
with ":augroup"); otherwise, Vim uses the group defined with [group].

==============================================================================
4. Listing autocommands					*autocmd-list*

:au[tocmd] [group] {event} {pat}
			Show the autocommands associated with {event} and
			{pat}.

:au[tocmd] [group] * {pat}
			Show the autocommands associated with {pat} for all
			events.

:au[tocmd] [group] {event}
			Show all autocommands for {event}.

:au[tocmd] [group]	Show all autocommands.

If you provide the [group] argument, Vim lists only the autocommands for
[group]; otherwise, Vim lists the autocommands for ALL groups.  Note that this
argument behavior differs from that for defining and removing autocommands.

In order to list buffer-local autocommands, use a pattern in the form <buffer>
or <buffer=N>.  See |autocmd-buflocal|.

							*:autocmd-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing an autocommand will also display where it
was last defined. Example: >

    :verbose autocmd BufEnter
    FileExplorer  BufEnter
	*	  call s:LocalBrowse(expand("<amatch>"))
	    Last set from /usr/share/vim/vim-7.0/plugin/NetrwPlugin.vim
<
See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

==============================================================================
5. Events					*autocmd-events* *E215* *E216*

You can specify a comma-separated list of event names.  No white space can be
used in this list.  The command applies to all the events in the list.

For READING FILES there are four kinds of events possible:
	BufNewFile			starting to edit a non-existent file
	BufReadPre	BufReadPost	starting to edit an existing file
	FilterReadPre	FilterReadPost	read the temp file with filter output
	FileReadPre	FileReadPost	any other file read
Vim uses only one of these four kinds when reading a file.  The "Pre" and
"Post" events are both triggered, before and after reading the file.

Note that the autocommands for the *ReadPre events and all the Filter events
are not allowed to change the current buffer (you will get an error message if
this happens).  This is to prevent the file to be read into the wrong buffer.

Note that the 'modified' flag is reset AFTER executing the BufReadPost
and BufNewFile autocommands.  But when the 'modified' option was set by the
autocommands, this doesn't happen.

You can use the 'eventignore' option to ignore a number of events or all
events.
					*autocommand-events* *{event}*
Vim recognizes the following events.  Vim ignores the case of event names
(e.g., you can use "BUFread" or "bufread" instead of "BufRead").

First an overview by function with a short explanation.  Then the list
alphabetically with full explanations |autocmd-events-abc|.

The alphabetical list of autocommand events:		*autocmd-events-abc*

							*BufCreate* *BufAdd*
BufAdd or BufCreate		Just after creating a new buffer which is
				added to the buffer list, or adding a buffer
				to the buffer list.
				Also used just after a buffer in the buffer
				list has been renamed.
				The BufCreate event is for historic reasons.
				NOTE: When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being created "<afile>".
							*BufDelete*
BufDelete			Before deleting a buffer from the buffer list.
				The BufUnload may be called first (if the
				buffer was loaded).
				Also used just before a buffer in the buffer
				list is renamed.
				NOTE: When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being deleted "<afile>" and "<abuf>".
				Don't change to another buffer, it will cause
				problems.
							*BufEnter*
BufEnter			After entering a buffer.  Useful for setting
				options for a file type.  Also executed when
				starting to edit a buffer, after the
				BufReadPost autocommands.
							*BufFilePost*
BufFilePost			After changing the name of the current buffer
				with the ":file" or ":saveas" command.
							*BufFilePre*
BufFilePre			Before changing the name of the current buffer
				with the ":file" or ":saveas" command.
							*BufHidden*
BufHidden			Just after a buffer has become hidden.  That
				is, when there are no longer windows that show
				the buffer, but the buffer is not unloaded or
				deleted.  Not used for ":qa" or ":q" when
				exiting Vim.
				NOTE: When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being unloaded "<afile>".
							*BufLeave*
BufLeave			Before leaving to another buffer.  Also when
				leaving or closing the current window and the
				new current window is not for the same buffer.
				Not used for ":qa" or ":q" when exiting Vim.
							*BufNew*
BufNew				Just after creating a new buffer.  Also used
				just after a buffer has been renamed.  When
				the buffer is added to the buffer list BufAdd
				will be triggered too.
				NOTE: When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being created "<afile>".
							*BufNewFile*
BufNewFile			When starting to edit a file that doesn't
				exist.  Can be used to read in a skeleton
				file.
						*BufRead* *BufReadPost*
BufRead or BufReadPost		When starting to edit a new buffer, after
				reading the file into the buffer, before
				executing the modelines.  See |BufWinEnter|
				for when you need to do something after
				processing the modelines.
				This does NOT work for ":r file".  Not used
				when the file doesn't exist.  Also used after
				successfully recovering a file.
				Also triggered for the filetypedetect group
				when executing ":filetype detect" and when
				writing an unnamed buffer in a way that the
				buffer gets a name.
							*BufReadCmd*
BufReadCmd			Before starting to edit a new buffer.  Should
				read the file into the buffer. |Cmd-event|
						*BufReadPre* *E200* *E201*
BufReadPre			When starting to edit a new buffer, before
				reading the file into the buffer.  Not used
				if the file doesn't exist.
							*BufUnload*
BufUnload			Before unloading a buffer.  This is when the
				text in the buffer is going to be freed.  This
				may be after a BufWritePost and before a
				BufDelete.  Also used for all buffers that are
				loaded when Vim is going to exit.
				NOTE: When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being unloaded "<afile>".
				Don't change to another buffer or window, it
				will cause problems!
				When exiting and v:dying is 2 or more this
				event is not triggered.
							*BufWinEnter*
BufWinEnter			After a buffer is displayed in a window.  This
				can be when the buffer is loaded (after
				processing the modelines) or when a hidden
				buffer is displayed in a window (and is no
				longer hidden).
				Does not happen for |:split| without
				arguments, since you keep editing the same
				buffer, or ":split" with a file that's already
				open in a window, because it re-uses an
				existing buffer.  But it does happen for a
				":split" with the name of the current buffer,
				since it reloads that buffer.
							*BufWinLeave*
BufWinLeave			Before a buffer is removed from a window.
				Not when it's still visible in another window.
				Also triggered when exiting.  It's triggered
				before BufUnload or BufHidden.
				NOTE: When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being unloaded "<afile>".
				When exiting and v:dying is 2 or more this
				event is not triggered.
							*BufWipeout*
BufWipeout			Before completely deleting a buffer.  The
				BufUnload and BufDelete events may be called
				first (if the buffer was loaded and was in the
				buffer list).  Also used just before a buffer
				is renamed (also when it's not in the buffer
				list).
				NOTE: When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being deleted "<afile>".
				Don't change to another buffer, it will cause
				problems.
						*BufWrite* *BufWritePre*
BufWrite or BufWritePre		Before writing the whole buffer to a file.
							*BufWriteCmd*
BufWriteCmd			Before writing the whole buffer to a file.
				Should do the writing of the file and reset
				'modified' if successful, unless '+' is in
				'cpo' and writing to another file |cpo-+|.
				The buffer contents should not be changed.
				When the command resets 'modified' the undo
				information is adjusted to mark older undo
				states as 'modified', like |:write| does.
				|Cmd-event|
							*BufWritePost*
BufWritePost			After writing the whole buffer to a file
				(should undo the commands for BufWritePre).
							*ChanInfo*
ChanInfo			State of channel changed, for instance the
				client of a RPC channel described itself.
				Sets these |v:event| keys:
				    info
				See |nvim_get_chan_info()| for the format of
				the info Dictionary.
							*ChanOpen*
ChanOpen			Just after a channel was opened.
				Sets these |v:event| keys:
				    info
				See |nvim_get_chan_info()| for the format of
				the info Dictionary.
							*CmdUndefined*
CmdUndefined			When a user command is used but it isn't
				defined.  Useful for defining a command only
				when it's used.  The pattern is matched
				against the command name.  Both <amatch> and
				<afile> are set to the name of the command.
				NOTE: Autocompletion won't work until the
				command is defined.  An alternative is to
				always define the user command and have it
				invoke an autoloaded function.  See |autoload|.
							*CmdlineChanged*
CmdlineChanged			After a change was made to the text inside
				command line.  Be careful not to mess up the
				command line, it may cause Vim to lock up.
				<afile> is set to the |cmdline-char|.
							*CmdlineEnter*
CmdlineEnter			After entering the command-line (including
				non-interactive use of ":" in a mapping: use
				|<Cmd>| instead to avoid this).
				<afile> is set to the |cmdline-char|.
				Sets these |v:event| keys:
				    cmdlevel
				    cmdtype
							*CmdlineLeave*
CmdlineLeave			Before leaving the command-line (including
				non-interactive use of ":" in a mapping: use
				|<Cmd>| instead to avoid this).
				<afile> is set to the |cmdline-char|.
				Sets these |v:event| keys:
				    abort (mutable)
				    cmdlevel
				    cmdtype
				Note: `abort` can only be changed from false
				to true. An autocmd cannot execute an already
				aborted cmdline by changing it to false.
							*CmdwinEnter*
CmdwinEnter			After entering the command-line window.
				Useful for setting options specifically for
				this special type of window.  This is
				triggered _instead_ of BufEnter and WinEnter.
				<afile> is set to a single character,
				indicating the type of command-line.
				|cmdwin-char|
							*CmdwinLeave*
CmdwinLeave			Before leaving the command-line window.
				Useful to clean up any global setting done
				with CmdwinEnter.  This is triggered _instead_
				of BufLeave and WinLeave.
				<afile> is set to a single character,
				indicating the type of command-line.
				|cmdwin-char|
							*ColorScheme*
ColorScheme			After loading a color scheme. |:colorscheme|
				The pattern is matched against the
				colorscheme name. <afile> can be used for the
				name of the actual file where this option was
				set, and <amatch> for the new colorscheme
				name.

							*ColorSchemePre*
ColorSchemePre			Before loading a color scheme. |:colorscheme|
				Useful to setup removing things added by a
				color scheme, before another one is loaded.

							*CompleteDone*
CompleteDone			After Insert mode completion is done.  Either
				when something was completed or abandoning
				completion. |ins-completion|
				The |v:completed_item| variable contains the
				completed item.

							*CursorHold*
CursorHold			When the user doesn't press a key for the time
				specified with 'updatetime'.  Not re-triggered
				until the user has pressed a key (i.e. doesn't
				fire every 'updatetime' ms if you leave Vim to
				make some coffee. :)  See |CursorHold-example|
				for previewing tags.
				This event is only triggered in Normal mode.
				It is not triggered when waiting for a command
				argument to be typed, or a movement after an
				operator.
				While recording the CursorHold event is not
				triggered. |q|
							*<CursorHold>*
				Internally the autocommand is triggered by the
				<CursorHold> key. In an expression mapping
				|getchar()| may see this character.

				Note: Interactive commands cannot be used for
				this event.  There is no hit-enter prompt,
				the screen is updated directly (when needed).
				Note: In the future there will probably be
				another option to set the time.
				Hint: to force an update of the status lines
				use: >
					:let &ro = &ro

							*CursorHoldI*
CursorHoldI			Just like CursorHold, but in Insert mode.
				Not triggered when waiting for another key,
				e.g. after CTRL-V, and not when in CTRL-X mode
				|insert_expand|.

							*CursorMoved*
CursorMoved			After the cursor was moved in Normal or Visual
				mode.  Also when the text of the cursor line
				has been changed, e.g., with "x", "rx" or "p".
				Not triggered when there is typeahead or when
				an operator is pending.
				For an example see |match-parens|.
				Careful: This is triggered very often, don't
				do anything that the user does not expect or
				that is slow.
							*CursorMovedI*
CursorMovedI			After the cursor was moved in Insert mode.
				Not triggered when the popup menu is visible.
				Otherwise the same as CursorMoved.
							*DiffUpdated*
DiffUpdated			After diffs have been updated.  Depending on
				what kind of diff is being used (internal or
				external) this can be triggered on every
				change or when doing |:diffupdate|.
							*DirChanged*
DirChanged			After the |current-directory| was changed.
				Sets these |v:event| keys:
				    cwd:   current working directory
				    scope: "global", "tab", "window"
				Recursion is ignored.
							*FileAppendCmd*
FileAppendCmd			Before appending to a file.  Should do the
				appending to the file.  Use the '[ and ']
				marks for the range of lines.|Cmd-event|
							*FileAppendPost*
FileAppendPost			After appending to a file.
							*FileAppendPre*
FileAppendPre			Before appending to a file.  Use the '[ and ']
				marks for the range of lines.
							*FileChangedRO*
FileChangedRO			Before making the first change to a read-only
				file.  Can be used to check-out the file from
				a source control system.  Not triggered when
				the change was caused by an autocommand.
				This event is triggered when making the first
				change in a buffer or the first change after
				'readonly' was set, just before the change is
				applied to the text.
				WARNING: If the autocommand moves the cursor
				the effect of the change is undefined.
							*E788*
				It is not allowed to change to another buffer
				here.  You can reload the buffer but not edit
				another one.
							*E881*
				If the number of lines changes saving for undo
				may fail and the change will be aborted.
							*ExitPre*
ExitPre				When using `:quit`, `:wq` in a way it makes
				Vim exit, or using `:qall`, just after
				|QuitPre|.  Can be used to close any
				non-essential window.  Exiting may still be
				cancelled if there is a modified buffer that
				isn't automatically saved, use |VimLeavePre|
				for really exiting.
							*FileChangedShell*
FileChangedShell		When Vim notices that the modification time of
				a file has changed since editing started.
				Also when the file attributes of the file
				change or when the size of the file changes.
				|timestamp|
				Mostly triggered after executing a shell
				command, but also with a |:checktime| command
				or when gvim regains input focus.
				This autocommand is triggered for each changed
				file.  It is not used when 'autoread' is set
				and the buffer was not changed.  If a
				FileChangedShell autocommand is present the
				warning message and prompt is not given.
				The |v:fcs_reason| variable is set to indicate
				what happened and |v:fcs_choice| can be used
				to tell Vim what to do next.
				NOTE: When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer that was changed, which is in "<afile>".
				NOTE: The commands must not change the current
				buffer, jump to another buffer or delete a
				buffer.  *E246* *E811*
				NOTE: This event never nests, to avoid an
				endless loop.  This means that while executing
				commands for the FileChangedShell event no
				other FileChangedShell event will be
				triggered.
							*FileChangedShellPost*
FileChangedShellPost		After handling a file that was changed outside
				of Vim.  Can be used to update the statusline.
							*FileReadCmd*
FileReadCmd			Before reading a file with a ":read" command.
				Should do the reading of the file. |Cmd-event|
							*FileReadPost*
FileReadPost			After reading a file with a ":read" command.
				Note that Vim sets the '[ and '] marks to the
				first and last line of the read.  This can be
				used to operate on the lines just read.
							*FileReadPre*
FileReadPre			Before reading a file with a ":read" command.
							*FileType*
FileType			When the 'filetype' option has been set.  The
				pattern is matched against the filetype.
				<afile> can be used for the name of the file
				where this option was set, and <amatch> for
				the new value of 'filetype'.  Navigating to
				another window or buffer is not allowed.
				See |filetypes|.
							*FileWriteCmd*
FileWriteCmd			Before writing to a file, when not writing the
				whole buffer.  Should do the writing to the
				file.  Should not change the buffer.  Use the
				'[ and '] marks for the range of lines.
				|Cmd-event|
							*FileWritePost*
FileWritePost			After writing to a file, when not writing the
				whole buffer.
							*FileWritePre*
FileWritePre			Before writing to a file, when not writing the
				whole buffer.  Use the '[ and '] marks for the
				range of lines.
							*FilterReadPost*
FilterReadPost			After reading a file from a filter command.
				Vim checks the pattern against the name of
				the current buffer as with FilterReadPre.
				Not triggered when 'shelltemp' is off.
							*FilterReadPre* *E135*
FilterReadPre			Before reading a file from a filter command.
				Vim checks the pattern against the name of
				the current buffer, not the name of the
				temporary file that is the output of the
				filter command.
				Not triggered when 'shelltemp' is off.
							*FilterWritePost*
FilterWritePost			After writing a file for a filter command or
				making a diff.
				Vim checks the pattern against the name of
				the current buffer as with FilterWritePre.
				Not triggered when 'shelltemp' is off.
							*FilterWritePre*
FilterWritePre			Before writing a file for a filter command or
				making a diff.
				Vim checks the pattern against the name of
				the current buffer, not the name of the
				temporary file that is the output of the
				filter command.
				Not triggered when 'shelltemp' is off.
							*FocusGained*
FocusGained			Nvim got focus.
							*FocusLost*
FocusLost			Nvim lost focus.  Also (potentially) when
				a GUI dialog pops up.
							*FuncUndefined*
FuncUndefined			When a user function is used but it isn't
				defined.  Useful for defining a function only
				when it's used.  The pattern is matched
				against the function name.  Both <amatch> and
				<afile> are set to the name of the function.
				NOTE: When writing Vim scripts a better
				alternative is to use an autoloaded function.
				See |autoload-functions|.
							*GUIEnter*
GUIEnter			After starting the GUI successfully, and after
				opening the window.  It is triggered before
				VimEnter when using gvim.  Can be used to
				position the window from a gvimrc file: >
	:autocmd GUIEnter * winpos 100 50
<							*GUIFailed*
GUIFailed			After starting the GUI failed.  Vim may
				continue to run in the terminal, if possible
				(only on Unix and alikes, when connecting the
				X server fails).  You may want to quit Vim: >
	:autocmd GUIFailed * qall
<							*InsertChange*
InsertChange			When typing <Insert> while in Insert or
				Replace mode.  The |v:insertmode| variable
				indicates the new mode.
				Be careful not to move the cursor or do
				anything else that the user does not expect.
							*InsertCharPre*
InsertCharPre			When a character is typed in Insert mode,
				before inserting the char.
				The |v:char| variable indicates the char typed
				and can be changed during the event to insert
				a different character.  When |v:char| is set
				to more than one character this text is
				inserted literally.

				Cannot change the text. |textlock|
				Not triggered when 'paste' is set.
							*TextYankPost*
TextYankPost			Just after a |yank| or |deleting| command, but not
				if the black hole register |quote_| is used nor
				for |setreg()|. Pattern must be *.
				Sets these |v:event| keys:
				    inclusive
				    operator
				    regcontents
				    regname
				    regtype
				The `inclusive` flag combined with the |'[|
				and |']| marks can be used to calculate the
				precise region of the operation.

				Recursion is ignored.
				Cannot change the text. |textlock|
							*InsertEnter*
InsertEnter			Just before starting Insert mode.  Also for
				Replace mode and Virtual Replace mode.  The
				|v:insertmode| variable indicates the mode.
				Be careful not to do anything else that the
				user does not expect.
				The cursor is restored afterwards.  If you do
				not want that set |v:char| to a non-empty
				string.
							*InsertLeave*
InsertLeave			When leaving Insert mode.  Also when using
				CTRL-O |i_CTRL-O|.  But not for |i_CTRL-C|.
							*MenuPopup*
MenuPopup			Just before showing the popup menu (under the
				right mouse button).  Useful for adjusting the
				menu for what is under the cursor or mouse
				pointer.
				The pattern is matched against a single
				character representing the mode:
					n	Normal
					v	Visual
					o	Operator-pending
					i	Insert
					c	Command line
MenuPopupChanged 					*MenuPopupChanged*
				After each time popup menu changed, not fired
				on popup menu hide, use |CompleteDone| for popup
				menu hide.

				Sets these |v:event| keys:
				    completed_item
				    height
				    width
				    row
				    col
				    size
				    scrollbar

				It is not allowed to change the text |textlock|.

							*OptionSet*
OptionSet			After setting an option.  The pattern is
				matched against the long option name.
				The |v:option_old| variable indicates the
				old option value, |v:option_new| variable
				indicates the newly set value, the
				|v:option_type| variable indicates whether
				it's global or local scoped and |<amatch>|
				indicates what option has been set.

				Usage example: Check for the existence of the
				directory in the 'backupdir' and 'undodir'
				options, create the directory if it doesn't
				exist yet.

				Note: It's a bad idea to reset an option
				during this autocommand, this may break a
				plugin. You can always use `:noa` to prevent
				triggering this autocommand.

				When using |:set| in the autocommand the event
				is not triggered again.

							*QuickFixCmdPre*
QuickFixCmdPre			Before a quickfix command is run (|:make|,
				|:lmake|, |:grep|, |:lgrep|, |:grepadd|,
				|:lgrepadd|, |:vimgrep|, |:lvimgrep|,
				|:vimgrepadd|, |:lvimgrepadd|, |:cscope|,
				|:cfile|, |:cgetfile|, |:caddfile|, |:lfile|,
				|:lgetfile|, |:laddfile|, |:helpgrep|,
				|:lhelpgrep|, |:cexpr|, |:cgetexpr|,
				|:caddexpr|, |:cbuffer|, |:cgetbuffer|,
				|:caddbuffer|).
				The pattern is matched against the command
				being run.  When |:grep| is used but 'grepprg'
				is set to "internal" it still matches "grep".
				This command cannot be used to set the
				'makeprg' and 'grepprg' variables.
				If this command causes an error, the quickfix
				command is not executed.
							*QuickFixCmdPost*
QuickFixCmdPost			Like QuickFixCmdPre, but after a quickfix
				command is run, before jumping to the first
				location. For |:cfile| and |:lfile| commands
				it is run after error file is read and before
				moving to the first error.
				See |QuickFixCmdPost-example|.
							*QuitPre*
QuitPre				When using `:quit`, `:wq` or `:qall`, before
				deciding whether it closes the current window
				or quits Vim.  Can be used to close any
				non-essential window if the current window is
				the last ordinary window.
				Also see |ExitPre|.
							*RemoteReply*
RemoteReply			When a reply from a Vim that functions as
				server was received |server2client()|.  The
				pattern is matched against the {serverid}.
				<amatch> is equal to the {serverid} from which
				the reply was sent, and <afile> is the actual
				reply string.
				Note that even if an autocommand is defined,
				the reply should be read with |remote_read()|
				to consume it.
							*SessionLoadPost*
SessionLoadPost			After loading the session file created using
				the |:mksession| command.
							*ShellCmdPost*
ShellCmdPost			After executing a shell command with |:!cmd|,
				|:make| and |:grep|.  Can be used to check for
				any changed files.
				For non-blocking shell commands, see
				|job-control|.
							*Signal*
Signal				After the nvim process received a signal.
				The pattern is matched against the name of the
				received signal. Only "SIGUSR1" is supported.
							*ShellFilterPost*
ShellFilterPost			After executing a shell command with
				":{range}!cmd", ":w !cmd" or ":r !cmd".
				Can be used to check for any changed files.
							*SourcePre*
SourcePre			Before sourcing a Vim script. |:source|
				<afile> is the name of the file being sourced.
							*SourceCmd*
SourceCmd			When sourcing a Vim script. |:source|
				<afile> is the name of the file being sourced.
				The autocommand must source this file.
				|Cmd-event|
							*SpellFileMissing*
SpellFileMissing		When trying to load a spell checking file and
				it can't be found.  The pattern is matched
				against the language.  <amatch> is the
				language, 'encoding' also matters.  See
				|spell-SpellFileMissing|.
							*StdinReadPost*
StdinReadPost			During startup, after reading from stdin into
				the buffer, before executing modelines. |--|
							*StdinReadPre*
StdinReadPre			During startup, before reading from stdin into
				the buffer. |--|
							*SwapExists*
SwapExists			Detected an existing swap file when starting
				to edit a file.  Only when it is possible to
				select a way to handle the situation, when Vim
				would ask the user what to do.
				The |v:swapname| variable holds the name of
				the swap file found, <afile> the file being
				edited.  |v:swapcommand| may contain a command
				to be executed in the opened file.
				The commands should set the |v:swapchoice|
				variable to a string with one character to
				tell Vim what should be done next:
					'o'	open read-only
					'e'	edit the file anyway
					'r'	recover
					'd'	delete the swap file
					'q'	quit, don't edit the file
					'a'	abort, like hitting CTRL-C
				When set to an empty string the user will be
				asked, as if there was no SwapExists autocmd.
							*E812*
				It is not allowed to change to another buffer,
				change a buffer name or change directory
				here.
							*Syntax*
Syntax				When the 'syntax' option has been set.  The
				pattern is matched against the syntax name.
				<afile> can be used for the name of the file
				where this option was set, and <amatch> for
				the new value of 'syntax'.
				See |:syn-on|.
							*TabEnter*
TabEnter			Just after entering a tab page. |tab-page|
				After triggering the WinEnter and before
				triggering the BufEnter event.
							*TabLeave*
TabLeave			Just before leaving a tab page. |tab-page|
				A WinLeave event will have been triggered
				first.
							*TabNew*
TabNew				When creating a new tab page. |tab-page|
				After WinEnter and before TabEnter.
							*TabNewEntered*
TabNewEntered			After entering a new tab page. |tab-page|
				After BufEnter.
							*TabClosed*
TabClosed			After closing a tab page. <afile> can be used
				for the tab page number.
							*TermClose*
TermClose			When a |terminal| job ends.
							*TermOpen*
TermOpen			When a |terminal| job is starting.  Can be
				used to configure the terminal buffer.
							*TermResponse*
TermResponse			After the response to t_RV is received from
				the terminal.  The value of |v:termresponse|
				can be used to do things depending on the
				terminal version.  Note that this event may be
				triggered halfway through another event
				(especially if file I/O, a shell command, or
				anything else that takes time is involved).
							*TextChanged*
TextChanged			After a change was made to the text in the
				current buffer in Normal mode.  That is when
				|b:changedtick| has changed.
				Not triggered when there is typeahead or when
				an operator is pending.
				Careful: This is triggered very often, don't
				do anything that the user does not expect or
				that is slow.
							*TextChangedI*
TextChangedI			After a change was made to the text in the
				current buffer in Insert mode.
				Not triggered when the popup menu is visible.
				Otherwise the same as TextChanged.
							*TextChangedP*
TextChangedP			After a change was made to the text in the
				current buffer in Insert mode, only when the
				popup menu is visible.  Otherwise the same as
				TextChanged.
							*User*
User				Never executed automatically.  To be used for
				autocommands that are only executed with
				":doautocmd".
				Note that when `:doautocmd User MyEvent` is
				used while there are no matching autocommands,
				you will get an error.  If you don't want
				that, define a dummy autocommand yourself.
							*UserGettingBored*
UserGettingBored		When the user presses the same key 42 times.
				Just kidding! :-)
							*VimEnter*
VimEnter			After doing all the startup stuff, including
				loading vimrc files, executing the "-c cmd"
				arguments, creating all windows and loading
				the buffers in them.
				Just before this event is triggered the
				|v:vim_did_enter| variable is set, so that you
				can do: >
				   if v:vim_did_enter
				     call s:init()
				   else
 	  			     au VimEnter * call s:init()
				   endif
<							*VimLeave*
VimLeave			Before exiting Vim, just after writing the
				.shada file.  Executed only once, like
				VimLeavePre.
<				Use |v:dying| to detect an abnormal exit.
				Use |v:exiting| to get the exit code.
				Not triggered if |v:dying| is 2 or more.
							*VimLeavePre*
VimLeavePre			Before exiting Vim, just before writing the
				.shada file.  This is executed only once,
				if there is a match with the name of what
				happens to be the current buffer when exiting.
				Mostly useful with a "*" pattern. >
	:autocmd VimLeavePre * call CleanupStuff()
<				Use |v:dying| to detect an abnormal exit.
				Use |v:exiting| to get the exit code.
				Not triggered if |v:dying| is 2 or more.
							*VimResized*
VimResized			After the Vim window was resized, thus 'lines'
				and/or 'columns' changed.  Not when starting
				up though.
							*VimResume*
VimResume			After Nvim resumes from |suspend| state.
							*VimSuspend*
VimSuspend			Before Nvim enters |suspend| state.
							*WinEnter*
WinEnter			After entering another window.  Not done for
				the first window, when Vim has just started.
				Useful for setting the window height.
				If the window is for another buffer, Vim
				executes the BufEnter autocommands after the
				WinEnter autocommands.
				Note: For split and tabpage commands the
				WinEnter event is triggered after the split
				or tab command but before the file is loaded.

							*WinLeave*
WinLeave			Before leaving a window.  If the window to be
				entered next is for a different buffer, Vim
				executes the BufLeave autocommands before the
				WinLeave autocommands (but not for ":new").
				Not used for ":qa" or ":q" when exiting Vim.

							*WinNew*
WinNew				When a new window was created.  Not done for
				the first window, when Vim has just started.
				Before a WinEnter event.

==============================================================================
6. Patterns					*autocmd-patterns* *{pat}*

The {pat} argument can be a comma separated list.  This works as if the
command was given with each pattern separately.  Thus this command: >
	:autocmd BufRead *.txt,*.info set et
Is equivalent to: >
	:autocmd BufRead *.txt set et
	:autocmd BufRead *.info set et

The file pattern {pat} is tested for a match against the file name in one of
two ways:
1. When there is no '/' in the pattern, Vim checks for a match against only
   the tail part of the file name (without its leading directory path).
2. When there is a '/' in the pattern, Vim checks for a match against both the
   short file name (as you typed it) and the full file name (after expanding
   it to a full path and resolving symbolic links).

The special pattern <buffer> or <buffer=N> is used for buffer-local
autocommands |autocmd-buflocal|.  This pattern is not matched against the name
of a buffer.

Examples: >
	:autocmd BufRead *.txt		set et
Set the 'et' option for all text files. >

	:autocmd BufRead /vim/src/*.c	set cindent
Set the 'cindent' option for C files in the /vim/src directory. >

	:autocmd BufRead /tmp/*.c	set ts=5
If you have a link from "/tmp/test.c" to "/home/nobody/vim/src/test.c", and
you start editing "/tmp/test.c", this autocommand will match.

Note:  To match part of a path, but not from the root directory, use a '*' as
the first character.  Example: >
	:autocmd BufRead */doc/*.txt	set tw=78
This autocommand will for example be executed for "/tmp/doc/xx.txt" and
"/usr/home/piet/doc/yy.txt".  The number of directories does not matter here.


The file name that the pattern is matched against is after expanding
wildcards.  Thus if you issue this command: >
	:e $ROOTDIR/main.$EXT
The argument is first expanded to: >
	/usr/root/main.py
Before it's matched with the pattern of the autocommand.  Careful with this
when using events like FileReadCmd, the value of <amatch> may not be what you
expect.


Environment variables can be used in a pattern: >
	:autocmd BufRead $VIMRUNTIME/doc/*.txt  set expandtab
And ~ can be used for the home directory (if $HOME is defined): >
	:autocmd BufWritePost ~/.config/nvim/init.vim   so <afile>
	:autocmd BufRead ~archive/*      set readonly
The environment variable is expanded when the autocommand is defined, not when
the autocommand is executed.  This is different from the command!

							*file-pattern*
The pattern is interpreted like mostly used in file names:
	*	matches any sequence of characters; Unusual: includes path
		separators
	?	matches any single character
	\?	matches a '?'
	.	matches a '.'
	~	matches a '~'
	,	separates patterns
	\,	matches a ','
	{ }	like \( \) in a |pattern|
	,	inside { }: like \| in a |pattern|
	\}	literal }
	\{	literal {
	\\\{n,m\}  like \{n,m} in a |pattern|
	\	special meaning like in a |pattern|
	[ch]	matches 'c' or 'h'
	[^ch]   match any character but 'c' and 'h'

Note that for all systems the '/' character is used for path separator (even
Windows). This was done because the backslash is difficult to use in a pattern
and to make the autocommands portable across different systems.

It is possible to use |pattern| items, but they may not work as expected,
because of the translation done for the above.

							*autocmd-changes*
Matching with the pattern is done when an event is triggered.  Changing the
buffer name in one of the autocommands, or even deleting the buffer, does not
change which autocommands will be executed.  Example: >

	au BufEnter *.foo  bdel
	au BufEnter *.foo  set modified

This will delete the current buffer and then set 'modified' in what has become
the current buffer instead.  Vim doesn't take into account that "*.foo"
doesn't match with that buffer name.  It matches "*.foo" with the name of the
buffer at the moment the event was triggered.

However, buffer-local autocommands will not be executed for a buffer that has
been wiped out with |:bwipe|.  After deleting the buffer with |:bdel| the
buffer actually still exists (it becomes unlisted), thus the autocommands are
still executed.

==============================================================================
7. Buffer-local autocommands	*autocmd-buflocal* *autocmd-buffer-local*
					*<buffer=N>* *<buffer=abuf>* *E680*

Buffer-local autocommands are attached to a specific buffer.  They are useful
if the buffer does not have a name and when the name does not match a specific
pattern.  But it also means they must be explicitly added to each buffer.

Instead of a pattern buffer-local autocommands use one of these forms:
	<buffer>	current buffer
	<buffer=99>	buffer number 99
	<buffer=abuf>	using <abuf> (only when executing autocommands)
			|<abuf>|

Examples: >
    :au CursorHold <buffer>  echo 'hold'
    :au CursorHold <buffer=33>  echo 'hold'
    :au BufNewFile * au CursorHold <buffer=abuf>  echo 'hold'

All the commands for autocommands also work with buffer-local autocommands,
simply use the special string instead of the pattern.  Examples: >
    :au! * <buffer>		     " remove buffer-local autocommands for
				     " current buffer
    :au! * <buffer=33>		     " remove buffer-local autocommands for
				     " buffer #33
    :bufdo :au! CursorHold <buffer>  " remove autocmd for given event for all
				     " buffers
    :au * <buffer>		     " list buffer-local autocommands for
				     " current buffer

Note that when an autocommand is defined for the current buffer, it is stored
with the buffer number.  Thus it uses the form "<buffer=12>", where 12 is the
number of the current buffer.  You will see this when listing autocommands,
for example.

To test for presence of buffer-local autocommands use the |exists()| function
as follows: >
    :if exists("#CursorHold#<buffer=12>") | ... | endif
    :if exists("#CursorHold#<buffer>") | ... | endif    " for current buffer

When a buffer is wiped out its buffer-local autocommands are also gone, of
course.  Note that when deleting a buffer, e.g., with ":bdel", it is only
unlisted, the autocommands are still present.  In order to see the removal of
buffer-local autocommands: >
    :set verbose=6

It is not possible to define buffer-local autocommands for a non-existent
buffer.

==============================================================================
8. Groups						*autocmd-groups*

Autocommands can be put together in a group.  This is useful for removing or
executing a group of autocommands.  For example, all the autocommands for
syntax highlighting are put in the "highlight" group, to be able to execute
":doautoall highlight BufRead" when the GUI starts.

When no specific group is selected, Vim uses the default group.  The default
group does not have a name.  You cannot execute the autocommands from the
default group separately; you can execute them only by executing autocommands
for all groups.

Normally, when executing autocommands automatically, Vim uses the autocommands
for all groups.  The group only matters when executing autocommands with
":doautocmd" or ":doautoall", or when defining or deleting autocommands.

The group name can contain any characters except white space.  The group name
"end" is reserved (also in uppercase).

The group name is case sensitive.  Note that this is different from the event
name!

							*:aug* *:augroup*
:aug[roup] {name}		Define the autocmd group name for the
				following ":autocmd" commands.  The name "end"
				or "END" selects the default group.
				To avoid confusion, the name should be
				different from existing {event} names, as this
				most likely will not do what you intended.

					*:augroup-delete* *E367* *W19* *E936*
:aug[roup]! {name}		Delete the autocmd group {name}.  Don't use
				this if there is still an autocommand using
				this group!  You will get a warning if doing
				it anyway. when the group is the current group
				you will get error E936.

To enter autocommands for a specific group, use this method:
1. Select the group with ":augroup {name}".
2. Delete any old autocommands with ":au!".
3. Define the autocommands.
4. Go back to the default group with "augroup END".

Example: >
	:augroup uncompress
	:  au!
	:  au BufEnter *.gz	%!gunzip
	:augroup END

This prevents having the autocommands defined twice (e.g., after sourcing the
vimrc file again).

==============================================================================
9. Executing autocommands				*autocmd-execute*

Vim can also execute Autocommands non-automatically.  This is useful if you
have changed autocommands, or when Vim has executed the wrong autocommands
(e.g., the file pattern match was wrong).

Note that the 'eventignore' option applies here too.  Events listed in this
option will not cause any commands to be executed.

					*:do* *:doau* *:doautocmd* *E217*
:do[autocmd] [<nomodeline>] [group] {event} [fname]
			Apply the autocommands matching [fname] (default:
			current file name) for {event} to the current buffer.
			You can use this when the current file name does not
			match the right pattern, after changing settings, or
			to execute autocommands for a certain event.
			It's possible to use this inside an autocommand too,
			so you can base the autocommands for one extension on
			another extension.  Example: >
				:au BufEnter *.cpp so ~/.config/nvim/init_cpp.vim
				:au BufEnter *.cpp doau BufEnter x.c
<			Be careful to avoid endless loops.  |autocmd-nested|

			When the [group] argument is not given, Vim executes
			the autocommands for all groups.  When the [group]
			argument is included, Vim executes only the matching
			autocommands for that group.  Note: if you use an
			undefined group name, Vim gives you an error message.
							*<nomodeline>*
			After applying the autocommands the modelines are
			processed, so that their settings overrule the
			settings from autocommands, like what happens when
			editing a file. This is skipped when the <nomodeline>
			argument is present. You probably want to use
			<nomodeline> for events that are not used when loading
			a buffer, such as |User|.
			Processing modelines is also skipped when no
			matching autocommands were executed.

						*:doautoa* *:doautoall*
:doautoa[ll] [<nomodeline>] [group] {event} [fname]
			Like ":doautocmd", but apply the autocommands to each
			loaded buffer.  Note that [fname] is used to select
			the autocommands, not the buffers to which they are
			applied.
			Careful: Don't use this for autocommands that delete a
			buffer, change to another buffer or change the
			contents of a buffer; the result is unpredictable.
			This command is intended for autocommands that set
			options, change highlighting, and things like that.

==============================================================================
10. Using autocommands					*autocmd-use*

For WRITING FILES there are four possible sets of events.  Vim uses only one
of these sets for a write command:

BufWriteCmd	BufWritePre	BufWritePost	writing the whole buffer
		FilterWritePre	FilterWritePost	writing to filter temp file
FileAppendCmd	FileAppendPre	FileAppendPost	appending to a file
FileWriteCmd	FileWritePre	FileWritePost	any other file write

When there is a matching "*Cmd" autocommand, it is assumed it will do the
writing.  No further writing is done and the other events are not triggered.
|Cmd-event|

Note that the *WritePost commands should undo any changes to the buffer that
were caused by the *WritePre commands; otherwise, writing the file will have
the side effect of changing the buffer.

Before executing the autocommands, the buffer from which the lines are to be
written temporarily becomes the current buffer.  Unless the autocommands
change the current buffer or delete the previously current buffer, the
previously current buffer is made the current buffer again.

The *WritePre and *AppendPre autocommands must not delete the buffer from
which the lines are to be written.

The '[ and '] marks have a special position:
- Before the *ReadPre event the '[ mark is set to the line just above where
  the new lines will be inserted.
- Before the *ReadPost event the '[ mark is set to the first line that was
  just read, the '] mark to the last line.
- Before executing the *WriteCmd, *WritePre and *AppendPre autocommands the '[
  mark is set to the first line that will be written, the '] mark to the last
  line.
Careful: '[ and '] change when using commands that change the buffer.

In commands which expect a file name, you can use "<afile>" for the file name
that is being read |:<afile>| (you can also use "%" for the current file
name).  "<abuf>" can be used for the buffer number of the currently effective
buffer.  This also works for buffers that don't have a name.  But it doesn't
work for files without a buffer (e.g., with ":r file").

							*gzip-example*
Examples for reading and writing compressed files: >
  :augroup gzip
  :  autocmd!
  :  autocmd BufReadPre,FileReadPre	*.gz set bin
  :  autocmd BufReadPost,FileReadPost	*.gz '[,']!gunzip
  :  autocmd BufReadPost,FileReadPost	*.gz set nobin
  :  autocmd BufReadPost,FileReadPost	*.gz execute ":doautocmd BufReadPost " . expand("%:r")
  :  autocmd BufWritePost,FileWritePost	*.gz !mv <afile> <afile>:r
  :  autocmd BufWritePost,FileWritePost	*.gz !gzip <afile>:r

  :  autocmd FileAppendPre		*.gz !gunzip <afile>
  :  autocmd FileAppendPre		*.gz !mv <afile>:r <afile>
  :  autocmd FileAppendPost		*.gz !mv <afile> <afile>:r
  :  autocmd FileAppendPost		*.gz !gzip <afile>:r
  :augroup END

The "gzip" group is used to be able to delete any existing autocommands with
":autocmd!", for when the file is sourced twice.

("<afile>:r" is the file name without the extension, see |:_%:|)

The commands executed for the BufNewFile, BufRead/BufReadPost, BufWritePost,
FileAppendPost and VimLeave events do not set or reset the changed flag of the
buffer.  When you decompress the buffer with the BufReadPost autocommands, you
can still exit with ":q".  When you use ":undo" in BufWritePost to undo the
changes made by BufWritePre commands, you can still do ":q" (this also makes
"ZZ" work).  If you do want the buffer to be marked as modified, set the
'modified' option.

To execute Normal mode commands from an autocommand, use the ":normal"
command.  Use with care!  If the Normal mode command is not finished, the user
needs to type characters (e.g., after ":normal m" you need to type a mark
name).

If you want the buffer to be unmodified after changing it, reset the
'modified' option.  This makes it possible to exit the buffer with ":q"
instead of ":q!".

							*autocmd-nested* *E218*
By default, autocommands do not nest.  If you use ":e" or ":w" in an
autocommand, Vim does not execute the BufRead and BufWrite autocommands for
those commands.  If you do want this, use the "++nested" flag for those
commands in which you want nesting.  For example: >
  :autocmd FileChangedShell *.c ++nested e!
The nesting is limited to 10 levels to get out of recursive loops.

It's possible to use the ":au" command in an autocommand.  This can be a
self-modifying command!  This can be useful for an autocommand that should
execute only once.

If you want to skip autocommands for one command, use the |:noautocmd| command
modifier or the 'eventignore' option.

Note: When reading a file (with ":read file" or with a filter command) and the
last line in the file does not have an <EOL>, Vim remembers this.  At the next
write (with ":write file" or with a filter command), if the same line is
written again as the last line in a file AND 'binary' is set, Vim does not
supply an <EOL>.  This makes a filter command on the just read lines write the
same file as was read, and makes a write command on just filtered lines write
the same file as was read from the filter.  For example, another way to write
a compressed file: >

  :autocmd FileWritePre *.gz   set bin|'[,']!gzip
  :autocmd FileWritePost *.gz  undo|set nobin
<
							*autocommand-pattern*
You can specify multiple patterns, separated by commas.  Here are some
examples: >

  :autocmd BufRead   *		set tw=79 nocin ic infercase fo=2croq
  :autocmd BufRead   .letter	set tw=72 fo=2tcrq
  :autocmd BufEnter  .letter	set dict=/usr/lib/dict/words
  :autocmd BufLeave  .letter	set dict=
  :autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile   *.c,*.h	set tw=0 cin noic
  :autocmd BufEnter  *.c,*.h	abbr FOR for (i = 0; i < 3; ++i)<CR>{<CR>}<Esc>O
  :autocmd BufLeave  *.c,*.h	unabbr FOR

For makefiles (makefile, Makefile, imakefile, makefile.unix, etc.): >

  :autocmd BufEnter  ?akefile*	set include=^s\=include
  :autocmd BufLeave  ?akefile*	set include&

To always start editing C files at the first function: >

  :autocmd BufRead   *.c,*.h	1;/^{

Without the "1;" above, the search would start from wherever the file was
entered, rather than from the start of the file.

						*skeleton* *template*
To read a skeleton (template) file when opening a new file: >

  :autocmd BufNewFile  *.c	0r ~/vim/skeleton.c
  :autocmd BufNewFile  *.h	0r ~/vim/skeleton.h
  :autocmd BufNewFile  *.java	0r ~/vim/skeleton.java

To insert the current date and time in a *.html file when writing it: >

  :autocmd BufWritePre,FileWritePre *.html   ks|call LastMod()|'s
  :fun LastMod()
  :  if line("$") > 20
  :    let l = 20
  :  else
  :    let l = line("$")
  :  endif
  :  exe "1," . l . "g/Last modified: /s/Last modified: .*/Last modified: " .
  :  \ strftime("%Y %b %d")
  :endfun

You need to have a line "Last modified: <date time>" in the first 20 lines
of the file for this to work.  Vim replaces <date time> (and anything in the
same line after it) with the current date and time.  Explanation:
	ks		mark current position with mark 's'
	call LastMod()  call the LastMod() function to do the work
	's		return the cursor to the old position
The LastMod() function checks if the file is shorter than 20 lines, and then
uses the ":g" command to find lines that contain "Last modified: ".  For those
lines the ":s" command is executed to replace the existing date with the
current one.  The ":execute" command is used to be able to use an expression
for the ":g" and ":s" commands.  The date is obtained with the strftime()
function.  You can change its argument to get another date string.

When entering :autocmd on the command-line, completion of events and command
names may be done (with <Tab>, CTRL-D, etc.) where appropriate.

Vim executes all matching autocommands in the order that you specify them.
It is recommended that your first autocommand be used for all files by using
"*" as the file pattern.  This means that you can define defaults you like
here for any settings, and if there is another matching autocommand it will
override these.  But if there is no other matching autocommand, then at least
your default settings are recovered (if entering this file from another for
which autocommands did match).  Note that "*" will also match files starting
with ".", unlike Unix shells.

						    *autocmd-searchpat*
Autocommands do not change the current search patterns.  Vim saves the current
search patterns before executing autocommands then restores them after the
autocommands finish.  This means that autocommands do not affect the strings
highlighted with the 'hlsearch' option.  Within autocommands, you can still
use search patterns normally, e.g., with the "n" command.
If you want an autocommand to set the search pattern, such that it is used
after the autocommand finishes, use the ":let @/ =" command.
The search-highlighting cannot be switched off with ":nohlsearch" in an
autocommand.  Use the 'h' flag in the 'shada' option to disable search-
highlighting when starting Vim.

							*Cmd-event*
When using one of the "*Cmd" events, the matching autocommands are expected to
do the file reading, writing or sourcing.  This can be used when working with
a special kind of file, for example on a remote system.
CAREFUL: If you use these events in a wrong way, it may have the effect of
making it impossible to read or write the matching files!  Make sure you test
your autocommands properly.  Best is to use a pattern that will never match a
normal file name, for example "ftp://*".

When defining a BufReadCmd it will be difficult for Vim to recover a crashed
editing session.  When recovering from the original file, Vim reads only those
parts of a file that are not found in the swap file.  Since that is not
possible with a BufReadCmd, use the |:preserve| command to make sure the
original file isn't needed for recovery.  You might want to do this only when
you expect the file to be modified.

For file read and write commands the |v:cmdarg| variable holds the "++enc="
and "++ff=" argument that are effective.  These should be used for the command
that reads/writes the file.  The |v:cmdbang| variable is one when "!" was
used, zero otherwise.

See the $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/netrwPlugin.vim for examples.

==============================================================================
11. Disabling autocommands				*autocmd-disable*

To disable autocommands for some time use the 'eventignore' option.  Note that
this may cause unexpected behavior, make sure you restore 'eventignore'
afterwards, using a |:try| block with |:finally|.

							*:noautocmd* *:noa*
To disable autocommands for just one command use the ":noautocmd" command
modifier.  This will set 'eventignore' to "all" for the duration of the
following command.  Example: >

	:noautocmd w fname.gz

This will write the file without triggering the autocommands defined by the
gzip plugin.
