      Move around:  Use the cursor keys, or "h" to go left,	       h   l
		    "j" to go down, "k" to go up, "l" to go right.	 j
Close this window:  Use ":q<Enter>".
   Get out of Vim:  Use ":qa!<Enter>" (careful, all changes are lost!).

Jump to a subject:  Position the cursor on a tag (e.g. |bars|) and hit CTRL-].
   With the mouse:  Double-click the left mouse button on a tag, e.g. |bars|.
	Jump back:  Type CTRL-O.  Repeat to go further back.

Get specific help:  It is possible to go directly to whatever you want help
		    on, by giving an argument to the |:help| command.
		    Prepend something to specify the context:  *help-context*

			  WHAT			PREPEND    EXAMPLE	~
		      Normal mode command		   :help x
		      Visual mode command	  v_	   :help v_u
		      Insert mode command	  i_	   :help i_<Esc>
		      Command-line command	  :	   :help :quit
		      Command-line editing	  c_	   :help c_<Del>
		      Vim command argument	  -	   :help -r
		      Option			  '	   :help 'textwidth'
		      Regular expression	  /	   :help /[
		    See |help-summary| for more contexts and an explanation.

  Search for help:  Type ":help word", then hit CTRL-D to see matching
		    help entries for "word".
		    Or use ":helpgrep word". |:helpgrep|

  Getting started:  Do the Vim tutor, a 20 minute interactive training for the
		    basic commands, see |vimtutor|.
		    Read the user manual from start to end: |usr_01.txt|

Vim stands for Vi IMproved.  Most of Vim was made by Bram Moolenaar, but only
through the help of many others.  See |credits|.

LOCAL ADDITIONS:				*local-additions*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*bars*		Bars example

Now that you've jumped here with CTRL-] or a double mouse click, you can use
CTRL-T, CTRL-O, g<RightMouse>, or <C-RightMouse> to go back to where you were.

Note that tags are within | characters, but when highlighting is enabled these
characters are hidden.  That makes it easier to read a command.

Anyway, you can use CTRL-] on any word, also when it is not within |, and Vim
will try to find help for it.  Especially for options in single quotes, e.g.
'hlsearch'.
