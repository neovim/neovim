2014 Jun 8)

Include a plugin manager with Vim? Neobundle seems to be the best currently.
Long message about this from ZyX, 2014 Mar 23.  And following replies.
Also see http://vim-wiki.mawercer.de/wiki/topic/vim%20plugin%20managment.html
User view:
- Support multiple sources, basically any http:// URL.  Be able to look into
  the files before deciding to install.
- Be able to try out a plugin and remove it again with (almost) no traces.
- Each plugin needs a "manifest" file that has the version, dependencies
  (including Vim version and features), conflicts, list of files, etc.
  Updater uses that to decide what/how to update.
  Dependencies can use a URL for specific versions, or short name for scripts
  on vim.org.
- Once a plugin is installed it remembers where it came from, updater checks
  there.  Can manually update when really needed.
- Must be possible to install for one user.  Also system wide?
- Can edit plugin config with Vim. Can temporarily disable a plugin.
- Run the update manually, find latest version and install.
- Be able to download without special tools, must work for 95% of users.
Implementation:
- Avoid the 'runtimepath' getting long.  Need some other way to keep each
  plugin separate.
- When installing or updating, first figure out what needs to be done. This
  may involve recursively fetching manifest files for dependencies.  Then show
  the user what's going to change and ask for OK.
- Scripts on Vim.org must be able to consist of several files.  Is zip format
  sufficient?  Upload the manifest?  Or refer to a site that has the manifest?
- Best is to fetch individual files or use a Vimball. Reduces dependency on
  tools that might be missing and allows inspection of the files before
  installing.
Out of scope:
- Overview of plugins, ratings, comments, etc.  That's another world.
- Development work on plugins (although diff with distributed version would be
  useful).

Space before comma in function definition not allowed: "function x(a , b)"
Give a more appropriate error message.  Add a remark to the docs.

When using "ab foo bar" and mapping <Tab> to <Esc>, pressing <Tab> after foo
doesn't trigger the abbreviation like <Esc> would. (Ramana Kumar, 2009 Sep 6)

getbufvar() to get a window-local option value for a buffer that's not
displayed in a window should return the value that's stored for that buffer.

":he ctrl_u" can be auto-corrected to ":he ctrl-u".

There should be a way after an abbreviation has expanded to go back to what
was typed.  CTRL-G h ?  Would also undo last word or line break inserted
perhaps.  And undo CTRL-W.  CTRL-G l would redo.

part of standard Vim.  The "1 to "9 registers are not sufficient.

netrw: dragging status line causes selection of entry.  Should check row
number to be below last visible line.

After doing "su" $HOME can be the old user's home, thus ~root/file is not
correct.  Don't use it in the swap file.

Completion for ":buf" doesn't work properly on Win32 when 'shellslash' is off.
(Henrik Ohman, 2009, Jan 29)

shellescape() depends on 'shellslash' for quoting.  That doesn't work when
'shellslash' is set but using cmd.exe. (Ben Fritz)
Use a different option or let it depend on whether 'shell' looks like a
unix-like shell?

Bug: in Ex mode (after "Q") backslash before line break, when yanked into a
register and executed, results in <Nul>: instead of line break.

Greek sigma character should be lower cased depending on the context.  Can we
make this work?  (Dominique Pelle, 2009 Sep 24)

When changing 'encoding' convert all the swap file names, so that we can
still delete them.  Also convert all buffer file names?

"gqip" in Insert mode has an off-by-one error, causing it to reflow text.
(Raul Coronado, 2009 Nov 2)

Update src/testdir/main.aap.

Something wrong with session that has "cd" commands and "badd", in such a way
that Vim doesn't find the edited file in the buffer list, causing the
ATTENTION message?  (Tony Mechelynck, 2008 Dec 1)
Also: swap files are in ~/tmp/  One has relative file name ".mozilla/...".

Add v:motion_force. (Kana Natsuno, 2008 Dec 6)
Maybe call it v:motiontype.

MS-Windows: editing the first, empty buffer, 'ffs' set to "unix,dos", ":enew"
doesn't set 'ff' to "unix".  (Ben Fritz, 2008 Dec 5) Reusing the old buffer
probably causes this.

'scrollbind' is not respected when deleting lines or undo. (Milan Vancura,
2009 Jan 16)

Patch to support strikethrough next to bold and italic. (Christian Brabandt,
2013 Jul 30)  Update from Ken Takata, 2013 Oct 12.

Having "Syntax" in 'eventignore' for :bufdo may cause problems, e.g. for
":bufdo e" when buffers are open in windows.  ex_listdo(eap) could set the
option only for when jumping to another buffer, not when the command argument
is executed.

":pedit %" with a BufReadPre autocommand causes the cursor to move to the
first line. (Ingo Karkat, 2008 Jul 1)  Ian Kelling is working on this.
Similar problem with ":e". (Marc Montu, 2014 Apr 22)

Wildmenu not deleted: "gvim -u NONE", ":set nocp wildmenu cmdheight=3
laststatus=2", CTRL-D CTRL-H CTRL-H CTRL-H. (A.Politz, 2008 April 1)
Works OK with Vim in an xterm.

Cursor line moves in other window when using CTRL-W J that doesn't change
anything.  (Dasn, 2009 Apr 7)

On Unix "glob('does not exist~')" returns the string.  Without the "~" it
doesn't. (John Little, 2008 Nov 9)
Shell expansion returns unexpanded string?
Don't use shell when "~" is not at the start?

":unlet $VAR" doesn't work.

When using ":e ++enc=foo file" and the file is already loaded with
'fileencoding' set to "bar", then do_ecmd() uses that buffer, even though the
fileencoding differs.  Reload the buffer in this situation?  Need to check for
the buffer to be unmodified.
Unfinished patch by Ian Kelling, 2008 Jul 11.  Followup Jul 14, need to have
another look at it.

c.vim: XXX in a comment is colored yellow, but not when it's after "#if 0".
(Ilya Dogolazky, 2009 Aug 7)

You can type ":w ++bad=x fname", but the ++bad argument is ignored.  Give an
error message?  Or is this easy to implement?  (Nathan Stratton Treadway, 2008
Aug 20)  This is in ucs2bytes(), search for 0xBF.  Using the ++bad argument is
at the other match for 0xBF.

When adding "-complete=file" to a user command this also changes how the
argument is processed for <f-args>. (Ivan Tishchenko, 2008 Aug 19)

Win32: associating a type with Vim doesn't take care of space after a
backslash? (Robert Vibrant, 2008 Jun 5)

When 'rightleft' is set, cursorcolumn isn't highlighted after the end of a
line.  It's also wrong in folds. (Dominique Pelle, 2010 Aug 21)

Using an insert mode expression mapping, cursor is not in the expected
position. (ZyX, 2010 Aug 29)

After using <Tab> for command line completion after ":ta blah" and getting E33
(no tags file), further editing the command to e.g., ":echo 'blah'", the
command is not executed.  Fix by Ian Kelling?

":help s/~" jumps to *s/\~*, while ":help s/\~" doesn't find anything. (Tim
Chase)  Fix by Ian Kelling, 2008 Jul 14.

Use "\U12345678" for 32 bit Unicode characters?  (Tony Mechelynck, 2009
Apr 6)  Or use "\u(123456)", similar to Perl.

When mapping : to ; and ; to :, @; doesn't work like @: and @: doesn't work
either.  Matt Wozniski:  nv_at() calls do_execreg() which uses
put_in_typebuf().  Char mapped twice?

Despite adding save_subexpr() this still doesn't work properly:
Regexp: matchlist('12a4aaa', '^\(.\{-}\)\(\%5c\@<=a\+\)\(.\+\)\?')
Returns ['12a4', 'aaa', '4aaa'], should be ['12a4', 'aaa', '']
Backreference not cleared when retrying after \@<= fails?

Problem with remote_send(). (Charles Campbell, 2008 Aug 12)

ftplugin for help file should set 'isk' to help file value.

Win32: remote editing fails when the current directory name contains "[".
(Ivan Tishchenko, Liu Yubao)  Suggested patch by Chris Lubinski: Avoid
escaping characters where the backslash is not removed later.  Asked Chris for
an alternate solution, also for src/ex_getln.c.
This also fails when the file or directory name contains "%". (Thoml, 2008
July 7)
Using --remote-silent while the current directory has a # in the name does not
work, the # needs to be escaped. (Tramblay Bruno, 2012 Sep 15)

When using remote-silent the -R flag is not passed on. (Axel Bender, 2012 May

Unexpectedly inserting a double quote. (Anton Woellert, 2008 Mar 23)
Works OK when 'cmdheight' is 2.

8   Use a mechanism similar to omni completion to figure out the kind of tab
    for CTRL-] and jump to the appropriate matching tag (if there are
    several).
    Alternative: be able to define a function that takes the tag name and uses
    taglist() to find the right location.  With indication of using CTRL-] so
    that the context can be taken into account. (Robert Webb)
Patch by Christian Brabandt, 2013 May 31.

Test54 should not use shell commands.  Make it portable.

In the swapfile dialog, add a H(elp) option that gives more info about what
each choice does.  Similar to  ":help swap-exists-choices"

try/catch not working for argument of return. (Matt Wozniski, 2008 Sep 15)

try/catch not working when inside a for loop. (ZyX, 2011 Jan 25)

":tab help" always opens a new tab, while ":help" re-uses an existing window.

'foldcolumn' in modeline applied to wrong window when using a session. (Teemu

Test 54 uses shell commands, that doesn't work on non-Unix systems.  Use some
other way to test buffer-local autocommands.

The documentation mentions the priority for ":2match" and ":3match", but it
appears the last one wins. (John Beckett, 2008 Jul 22)  Caused by adding
matchadd()?  Suggested patch by John, 2008 Jul 24.

When 'encoding' is utf-8 the command line is redrawn as a whole on every
character typed. (Tyler Spivey, 2008 Sep 3)  Only redraw cmdline for
'arabicshape' when there is a character on the command line for which
(ARABIC_CHAR(u8c)) is TRUE.

When opening quickfix window, disable spell checking?

Problem with ".add" files when using two languages and restarting Vim. (Raul

Popup menu redraw: Instead of first redrawing the text and then drawing the
popup menu over it, first draw the new popup menu, remember its position and
size and then redraw the text, skipping the characters under the popup menu.
This should avoid flicker.  Other solution by A.Politz, 2007 Aug 22.

Windows 98: pasting from the clipboard with text from another application has
a trailing NUL.  (Joachim Hofmann)  Perhaps the length specified for CF_TEXT
isn't right?

When a register contains illegal bytes, writing viminfo in utf-8 and reading
it back doesn't result in utf-8. (Devin Bayer)

Command line completion: Scanning for tags doesn't check for typed key now and
then?  Hangs for about 5 seconds.  Appears to be caused by finding include
files with "foo/**" in 'path'.  (Kalisiak, 2006 July 15)
Additional info: When using the |wildcards| ** globing, vim hangs
indefinitely on lots of directories. The |file-searching| globing, like in
":set path=/**" does not hang as often as with globing with |wildcards|, like
in ":1find /**/file".  This is for files that unix "find" can find very
quickly. Merging the 2 kinds of globing might make this an easier fix. (Ian
Kelling, 2008 July 4)

When the file name has parenthesis, e.g., "foo (bar).txt", ":!ls '%'" has the
parenthesis escaped but not the space.  That's inconsistent.  Either escape
neither or both.  No escaping might be best, because it doesn't depend on
particularities of the shell. (Zvi Har'El, 2007 Nov 10) (Teemu Likonen, 2008
Jun 3)
However, for backwards compatibility escaping might be necessary.  Check if
the user put quotes around the expanded item?

A throw in a function causes missing an endif below the call. (Spiros

Error E324 can be given when a cron script has wiped out our temp directory.
Give a clear error message about this (and tell them not to wipe out /tmp).

Color for cUserLabel should differ from case label, so that a mistake in a

go to Insert mode and add a few lines.  Then backspacing every other time
moves the cursor instead of deleting. (Chris Kaiser, 2007 Sep 25)

Windows installer should install 32-bit version of right-click handler also on

":lockvar" should use copyID to avoid endless loop.

When using --remote-silent and the file name matches 'wildignore' get an E479
error.  without --remote-silent it works fine. (Ben Fritz, 2008 Jun 20)

Gvim: dialog for closing Vim should check if Vim is busy writing a file.  Then
use a different dialog: "busy saving, really quit? yes / no".

":helpgrep" should use the directory from 'helpfile'.

The need_fileinfo flag is messy.  Instead make the message right away and put
it in keep_msg?

Editing a file remotely that matches 'wildignore' results in a "no match"
error.  Should only happen when there are wildcards, not when giving the file
name literally, and esp. if there is only one name.

Test 61 fails sometimes.  This is a timing problem: "sleep 2" sometimes takes
longer than 2 seconds.

Using ":au CursorMoved * cmd" invokes mch_FullName(), which can be slow.
Can this be avoided? (Thomas Waba, 2008 Aug 24)
Also for ":w" without a file name.
The buffer has the full path in ffname, should pass this to the autocommand.

input() completion should not insert a backslash to escape a space in a file
name?

Ruby completion is insecure.  Can this be fixed?

When 'backupskip' is set from $TEMP special characters need to be escaped.
(patch by Grembowietz, 2007 Feb 26, not quite right)
Another problem is that file_pat_to_reg_pat() doesn't recognize "\\", so "\\(" 
will be seen as a path separator plus "\(".

gvim d:\path\path\(FILE).xml should not remove the \ before the (.
This also fails with --remote.

When doing ":quit" the Netbeans "killed" event isn't sent.  (Xavier de Gaye,

Spell checking: Add a way to specify punctuation characters.  Add the
superscript numbers by default: 0x2070, 0xb9, 0xb2, 0xb3, 0x2074 - 0x2079.

Spell checking in popup menu: If the only problem is the case of the first
character, don't offer "ignore" and "add to word list".

Use different pt_br dictionary for spell checking. (Jackson A. Aquino, 2006

Use different romanian dictionary for spell checking. (Andrei Popescu, Nov
2008)  Use http://downloads.sourceforge.net/rospell/ro_RO.3.2.zip
Or the hunspell-ro.3.2.tar.gz file, it also has a iso-8859-2 list.

In a C file with spell checking, in "% integer" "nteger" is seen as an error,
but "]s" doesn't find it.  "nteger" by itself is found. (Ralf Wildenhues, 2008
Jul 22)

There should be something about spell checking in the user manual.

Spell menu: When using the Popup menu to select a replacement word,
":spellrepeat" doesn't work.  SpellReplace() uses setline().  Can it use "z="
somehow?  Or use a new function.

Mac: Using gvim: netrw window disappears. (Nick Lo, 2006 Jun 21)

Add an option to specify the character to use when a double-width character is

that char is single width when it's set (compare with 'listchars').

The generated vim.bat can avoid the loop for NT. (Carl Zmola, 2006 Sep 3)

When showing a diff between a non-existent file and an existing one, with the
cursor in the empty buffer, the other buffer only shows the last line.  Change
the "insert" into a change from one line to many? (Yakov Lerner, 2008 May 27)

Add autocommand for when a tabpage is being closed.  Also for when a tab page
has been created.

Using ":make" blocks Vim.  Allow running one make in the background (if the
shell supports it), catch errors in a file and update the error list on the
fly.  A bit like "!make > file&" and repeating ":cf file".  ":bgmake",
background make.  ":bgcancel" interrupts it.
A.Politz may work on this.

These two abbreviations don't give the same result:
	let asdfasdf = "xyz\<Left>"

Michael Dietrich: maximized gvim sometimes displays output of external command

For Aap: include a config.arg.example file with hints how to use config.arg.

Command line completion when 'cmdheight' is maximum and 'wildmenu' is set,
only one buffer line displayed, causes display errors.

Completing with 'wildmenu' and using <Up> and <Down> to move through directory
tree stops unexpectedly when using ":cd " and entering a directory that
doesn't contain other directories.

Default for 'background' is wrong when using xterm with 256 colors.
Table with estimates from Matteo Cavalleri, 2014 Jan 10.

Setting 'background' resets the Normal background color:
   highlight Normal ctermbg=DarkGray
   set background=dark
This is undesired, 'background' is supposed to tell Vim what the background
color is, not reset it.

Linux distributions:
- Suggest compiling xterm with --enable-tcap-query, so that nr of colors is
  known to Vim.  88 colors instead of 16 works better.  See ":help
  xfree-xterm".
- Suggest including bare "vi" and "vim" with X11, syntax, etc.

Completion menu: For a wrapping line, completing a long file name, only the
start of the path is shown in the menu.  Should move the menu to the right to
show more text of the completions.  Shorten the items that don't fit in the
middle?

When running inside screen it's possible to kill the X server and restart it
(using pty's the program can keep on running).  Vim dies because it loses the
connection to the X server.  Can Vim simply quit using the X server instead of
dying?  Also relevant when running in a console.

Accessing file#var in a function should not need the g: prepended.

When exiting detects a modified buffer, instead of opening the buffer in the
current tab, use an existing tab, if possible.  Like finding a window where
the buffer is displayed. (Antonios Tsakiridis)

When ":cn" moves to an error in the same line the message isn't shortened.
Only skip shortening for ":cc"?

Write "making vim work better" for the docs (mostly pointers): *nice*

and restoring.  Only with 'nowrap'. (Robert Webb, 2008 Aug 25)

Netrw has trouble executing autocommands only for a directory.  Add <isdir>
and <notisdir> to autocommand patterns?  Also <isfile>?

Add command modifier that skips wildcard expansion, so that you don't need to
put backslashes before special chars, only for white space.

Syntax HL: open two windows on the same C code, delete a ")" in one window,
resulting in highlighted "{" in that window, not in the other.

In mswin.vim: Instead of mapping <C-V> for Insert mode in a complicated way,
can it be done like ":imap <C-V> <MiddleMouse>" without negative side effects?

When right after "vim file", "M" then CTRL-W v the windows are scrolled
differently and unexpectedly.  Caused by patch 7.2.398?

The magic clipboard format "VimClipboard2" appears in several places.  Should
be only one.

It's difficult to debug numbered functions (function in a Dictionary).  Print
the function name before resolving it to a number?
	let d = {}
	fun! d.foo()
	  echo "here"
	endfun
	call d.foo(9)

Add a mark for the other end of the Visual area (VIsual pos).  '< and '> are
only set after Visual moded is ended.
Also add a variable for the Visual mode.  So that this mode and '< '> can be
used to set what "gv" selects. (Ben Schmidt)

Win32: When running ":make" and 'encoding' differs from the system locale, the
output should be converted.  Esp. when 'encoding' is "utf-8". (Yongwei Wu)
Should we use 'termencoding' for this?

Win32, NTFS: When editing a specific infostream directly and 'backupcopy' is
"auto" should detect this situation and work like 'backupcopy' is "yes".  File
name is something like "c:\path\foo.txt:bar", includes a colon.  (Alex
Jakushev, 2008 Feb 1)

printf() uses the field width in bytes. Can it be made character width,
perhaps with a modifier?  What does Posix say?

Small problem displaying diff filler line when opening windows with a script.
(David Luyer, 2007 Mar 1 ~/Mail/oldmail/mool/in.15872 )

Is it allowed that 'backupext' is empty?  Problems when backup is in same dir
as original file?  If it's OK don't compare with 'patchmode'. (Thierry Closen)

Patch for supporting count before CR in quickfix window. (AOYAMA Shotaro, 2007
Jan 1)

Patch for adding ":lscscope". (Navdeep Parhar, 2007 Apr 26; update 2008 Apr
23)

":mkview" isn't called with the right buffer argument.  Happens when using
tabs and the autocommand "autocmd BufWinLeave * mkview".  (James Vega, 2007
Jun 18)

xterm should be able to pass focus changes to Vim, so that Vim can check for
buffers that changed.  Perhaps in misc.c, function selectwindow().
Xterm 224 supports it!

When completing from another file that uses a different encoding completion
text has the wrong encoding.  E.g., when 'encoding' is utf-8 and file is
latin1.  Example from Gombault Damien, 2007 Mar 24.

Is it possible to use "foo#var" instead of "g:foo#var" inside a function?

Syntax HL: When using "nextgroup" and the group has an empty match, there is
no search at that position for another match. (Lukas Mai, 2008 April 11)

In gvim the backspace key produces a backspace character, but on Linux the
VERASE key is Delete.  Set VERASE to Backspace? (patch by Stephane Chazelas,
2007 Oct 16)

Create a gvimtutor.1 file and change Makefiles to install it.

When 'encoding' is utf-8 typing text at the end of the line causes previously
typed characters to be redrawn.  Caused by patch 7.1.329. (Tyler Spivey, 2008
Sep 3, 11)

X11: Putting more than about 262040 characters of text on the clipboard and
pasting it in another Vim doesn't work.  (Dominique Pelle, 2008 Aug 21-23)
clip_x11_request_selection_cb() is called with zero value and length.
Also: Get an error message from free() in the process that owns the selection.
Seems to happen when the selection is requested the second time, but before
clip_x11_convert_selection_cb() is invoked, thus in X library code.

":vimgrep" does not recognize a recursive symlink.  Is it possible to detect
this, at least for Unix (using device/inode)?

When switching between windows the cursor is often put in the middle.
Remember the relative position and restore that, just like lnum and col are
restored. (Luc St-Louis)

Add an option for a minimal text length before inserting a line break for
'textwidth'.  Avoids very short lines when a very long word follows.
(Kartik Agaram)


At next release:
-   Build a huge version by default.
-   Improve plugin handling: Automatic updates, handle dependencies?
    E.g. Vundle: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle

Awaiting updated patches:
9   Mac unicode patch (Da Woon Jung, Eckehard Berns):
    8   Add patch from Muraoka Taro (Mar 16) to support input method on Mac?
	New patch 2004 Jun 16
    - selecting proportional font breaks display
    - UTF-8 text causes display problems.  Font replacement causes this.
    - Command-key mappings do not work. (Alan Schmitt)
    - With 'nopaste' pasting is wrong, with 'paste' Command-V doesn't work.
      (Alan Schmitt)
9   HTML indenting can be slow.  Caused by using searchpair().  Can search()
    be used instead?  A.Politz is looking into a solution.
8   Win32: Add minidump generation. (George Reilly, 2006 Apr 24)
8   Add ":n" to fnamemodify(): normalize path, remove "../" when possible.
    Aric Blumer has a patch for this.  He will update the patch for 6.3.
7   Completion of network shares, patch by Yasuhiro Matsumoto.
    Update 2004 Sep 6.
    How does this work?  Missing comments.
8   Add a few more command names to the menus.  Patch from Jiri Brezina
    (28 feb 2002).  Will mess the translations...
7   ATTENTION dialog choices are more logical when "Delete it" appears
    before "Quit".  Patch by Robert Webb, 2004 May 3.
-   Include flipcase patch: ~/vim/patches/wall.flipcase2 ?  Make it work
    for multi-byte characters.
-   Win32: add options to print dialog.  Patch from Vipin Aravind.
-   Patch to add highlighting for whitespace. (Tom Schumm, 2003 Jul 5)
    use the patch that keeps using HLF_8 if HLF_WS has not
    been given values.
    Add section in help files for these highlight groups?
8   "fg" and "bg" don't work in an xterm.  Get default colors from xterm
    with an ESC sequence.
    xterm can send colors for many things.  E.g. for the cursor:
	<Esc>]12;?<Bel>
    Can use this to get the background color and restore the colors on exit.
7   Add "DefaultFG" and "DefaultBG" for the colors of the menu. (Marcin
    Dalecki has a patch for Motif and Carbon)
-   Add possibility to highlight specific columns (for Fortran).  Or put a
    line in between columns (e.g., for 'textwidth').
    Patch to add 'hlcolumn' from Vit Stradal, 2004 May 20.
8   Add functions:
    gettext()		Translate a message.  (Patch from Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
			Update 2004 Sep 10
			Another patch from Edward L. Fox (2005 Nov 24)
			Search in 'runtimepath'?
			More docs needed about how to use this.
			How to get the messages into the .po files?
    strchars()		Like strlen() and strwidth() but counting characters
			instead of bytes.
    confirm()		add "flags" argument, with 'v' for vertical
			    layout and 'c' for console dialog. (Haegg)
			    Flemming Madsen has a patch for the 'c' flag
			    (2003 May 13)
    raisewin()		raise gvim window (see HierAssist patch for
			    Tcl implementation ~/vim/HierAssist/ )
    taglist()		add argument to specify maximum number of matches.
			useful for interactive things or completion.
    col('^')            column of first non-white character.
			Can use "len(substitute(getline('.'), '\S.*', '', ''))
			+ 1", but that's ugly.
7   Add patch from Benoit Cerrina to integrate Vim and Perl functions
    better.  Now also works for Ruby (2001 Nov 10)
-   Patch from Herculano de Lima Einloft Neto for better formatting of the
    quickfix window (2004 dec 2)
7   When 'rightleft' is set, the search pattern should be displayed right
    to left as well?  See patch of Dec 26. (Nadim Shaikli)
8   Option to lock all used memory so that it doesn't get swapped to disk
    (uncrypted).  Patch by Jason Holt, 2003 May 23.  Uses mlock.
7   Add ! register, for shell commands. (patch from Grenie)
8   In the gzip plugin, also recognize *.gz.orig, *.gz.bak, etc.  Like it's
    done for filetype detection.  Patch from Walter Briscoe, 2003 Jul 1.
7   Add a "-@ filelist" argument: read file names from a file. (David
    Kotchan has a patch for it)
8   Include a connection to an external program through a pipe?  See
    patches from Felbinger for a mathematica interface.
    Or use emacs server kind of thing?
7   Add ":justify" command.  Patch from Vit Stradal 2002 Nov 25.
-   findmatch() should be adjusted for Lisp.  See remark at
    get_lisp_indent().  Esp. \( and \) should be skipped. (Dorai Sitaram,
    incomplete patch Mar 18)
-   Patch for "paranoid mode" by Kevin Collins, March 7.  Needs much more work.


MSDOS and Win32:
8   Should $USERPROFILE be preferred above $HOMEDRIVE/$HOMEPATH?  No, but it's
    a good fallback, thus use:
	    $HOME
	    $HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH
	    SHGetSpecialFolderPath(NULL, lpzsPath, CSIDL_APPDATA, FALSE);
	    $USERPROFILE
	    SHGetSpecialFolderPath(NULL, lpzsPath, CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA, FALSE);
	    $ALLUSERSPROFILE
	    $SYSTEMDRIVE\
	    C:\
8   Win32 console: <M-Up> and <M-Down> don't work. (Geddes)  We don't have
    special keys for these.  Should use modifier + key.
8   Win32 console: caps-lock makes non-alpha keys work like with shift.
    Should work like in the GUI version.
8   Environment variables in DOS are not case sensitive.  Make a define for
    STRCMP_ENV(), and use it when comparing environment var names.
8   Setting 'shellslash' has no immediate effect.  Change all file names when
    it is set/reset?  Or only use it when actually executing a shell command?
8   When editing a file on a Samba server, case might matter.  ":e file"
    followed by ":e FILE" will edit "file" again, even though "FILE" might be
    another one.  Set last used name in buflist_new()?  Fix do_ecmd(), etc.
8   When a buffer is editing a file like "ftp://mach/file", which is not going
    to be used like a normal file name, don't change the slashes to
    backslashes. (Ronald Hoellwarth)


Win32 console:
9   When editing a file by its short file name, it should be expanded into its
    long file name, to avoid problems like these: (Mccollister)
     1) Create a file called ".bashrc" using some other editor.
     2) Drag that file onto a shortcut or the actual executable.
     3) Note that the file name is something like BASHRC~1
     4) Go to File->Save As menu item and type ".bashrc" as the file name.
     5) Press "Yes" to indicate that I want to overwrite the file.
     6) Note that the message "File exists (add ! to override)" is displayed
	and the file is not saved.
    Use FindFirstFile() to expand a file name and directory in the path to its
    long name.
7   Re-install the use of $TERM and support the use of different terminals,
    besides the console.
8   Use of <altgr> modifier doesn't work?  5.3 was OK. (Garcia-Suarez/Guckes)
9   Mapping <C-S-Tab> doesn't work correctly.  How to see the difference with
    <C-S-i>?
9   tmpnam() uses file in root of file system: "\asdf".  That doesn't work on
    a Netware network drive.  Use same function as for Win32 GUI?
8   In os_win32.h, HAVE_STRICMP and HAVE_STRNICMP are defined only if __GNUC__
    is not defined.  Shouldn't that be the other way around?
7   Use SetConsoleCP() and SetConsoleOutputCP() to implement 'termencoding'?
    Avoids that input and output work differently.  Need to be restored when
    exiting.


Macintosh:
7   Loading the Perl library only works on OS/X 10.2 or 10.3, never on both.
    Load the Perl library dynamically see Python sources file dynload_mac
    (Jack)
    dynamic linking: http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2064.html
8   inputdialog() doesn't resize when giving more text lines. (David Fishburn,
    2006 Sept 28)
8   Define vim_mkdir() for Macintosh.
8   Define mch_writable() for Macintosh.
9   When DiskLock is running, using a swap file causes a crash.  Appears to be
    a problem with writing a file that starts with a dot. (Giacalone)
9   In mac_expandpath() check that handling of backslashes is done properly.


"Small" problems:
-   Can't disable terminal flow control, to enable the use of CTRL-S and
    CTRL-Q.  Add an option for it?
-   When using e_secure in do_one_cmd() mention the command being executed,
    otherwise it's not clear where it comes from.
-   When the quickfix window is open and executing ":echo 'hello'" using the
    Command-line window, the text is immediately removed by the redrawing.
    (Michael Henry, 2008 Nov 1)
    Generic solution: When redrawing while there is a message on the
    cmdline, don't erase the display but draw over the existing text.
    Other solution, redraw after closing the cmdline window, before executing
    the command.
9   For Turkish vim_tolower() and vim_toupper() also need to use utf_
    functions for characters below 0x80. (Sertacyildiz)
9   When the last edited file is a help file, using '0 in a new Vim doesn't
    edit the file as a help file.  'filetype' is OK, but 'iskeyword' isn't,
    file isn't readonly, etc.
8   When an ":edit" is inside a try command and the ATTENTION prompt is used,
    the :catch commands are always executed, also when the file is edited
    normally.  Should reset did_emsg and undo side effects.  Also make sure
    the ATTENTION message shows up.  Servatius Brandt works on this.
7   Vimtutor leaves escape sequence in terminal. This is the xterm response to
    requesting the version number.  (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
8   When redirecting and using ":silent" the current column for displaying and
    redirection can be different.  Use a separate variable to hold the column
    for redirection.
7   The messages for "vim --help" and "vim --version" don't use
    'termencoding'.
-   Could the hit-enter prompt be avoided when a message only overlaps the
    'showcmd' area?  Clear that area when the next cmd is typed.
8   When 'scrollbind' is set, a window won't scroll horizontally if the cursor
    line is too short.  Add a word in 'scrollopt' to allow moving the cursor
    to longer line that is visible.  A similar thing is done for the GUI when
    using the horizontal scrollbar.
7   VisVim can only open one file.  Hard to solve: each opened file is passed
    with a separate invocation, would need to use timestamps to know the
    invocations belong together.
8   When giving a ":bwipeout" command a file-changed dialog may popup for this
    buffer, which is pointless.  (Mike Williams)
8   On MS-Windows ":make" doesn't show output while it is working.  Use the
    tee.exe from  http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ ?  About 16 Kbyte in the
    UnxUtils.zip archive.
    Alternate one: http://www.pramodx.20m.com/tee_for_win32.htm, but Walter
    Briscoe says it's not as good.
8   When doing Insert mode completion a mapping cannot recursively call
    edit(), because the completion information is global.  Put everything in
    an allocated structure?
8   Command line completion: buffers "foo.txt" and "../b/foo.txt", completing
    ":buf foo<Tab>" doesn't find the second one. (George V. Reilly)
7   mb_off2cells() doesn't work correctly on the tail byte of a double-byte
    character. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)  It should return 1 when used on a tail
    byte, like for utf-8.  Store second byte of double-byte in ScreenLines2[]
    (like for DBCS_JPNU) and put a zero in the second byte (like for UTF-8).
7   Inside a function with "perl <<EOF" a line with "$i++" is recognized as an
    ":insert" command, causing the following "endfunction" not to be found.
    Add skipping this perl construction inside function definitions.
7   When 'ttimeoutlen' is 10 and 'timeoutlen' is 1000, there is a keycode
    "<Esc>a" and a mapping <Esc>x", when typing "<Esc>a" with half a second
    delay should not be interpreted as a keycode. (Hans Ginzel)
7   ":botright 1 new" twice causes all window heights to be changed.  Make the
    bottom window only bigger as much as needed.
7   The Cygwin and MingW makefiles define "PC", but it's not used anywhere.
    Remove? (Dan Sharp)
9   User commands use the context of the script they were defined in.  This
    causes a "s:var" argument to unexpectedly use a variable in the defining
    script, not the calling script.  Add an argument to ":command":
    "-keepcontext".  Do replace <SID>, so that a function in the defining
    script can be called.
8   The Japanese message translations for MS-Windows are called ja.sjis.po,
    but they use encoding cp932.  Rename the file and check that it still
    works.
8   A very long message in confirm() can't be quit.  Make this possible with
    CTRL-C.
8   "gf" always excludes trailing punctuation characters.  file_name_in_line()
    is currently fixed to use ".,:;!".  Add an option to make this
    configurable?
8   'hkmap' should probably be global-local.
9   When "$" is in 'cpoptions' and folding is active, a "C" command changes
    the folds and resets w_lines_valid.  The display updating doesn't work
    then. (Pritesh Mistry)
8   Using ":s" in a function changes the previous replacement string.  Save
    "old_sub" in save_search_patterns()?
8   Should allow multi-byte characters for the delimiter: ":s+a+b+" where "+"
    is a multi-byte character.
8   When appending to a file and 'patchmode' isn't empty, a backup file is
    always written, even when the original file already exists.
9   When getting focus while writing a large file, could warn for this file
    being changed outside of Vim.  Avoid checking this while the file is being
    written.
7   The message in bt_dontwrite_msg() could be clearer.
8   The script ID that is stored with an option and displayed with ":verbose
    set" isn't reset when the option is set internally.  For example when
    'foldlevel' is set from 'foldlevelstart'.
8   Also store the line number with the script ID and use it for ":verbose",
    so that "set nocompatible" is found when it changes other option values.
    When an option is set indirectly mention the command?  E.g. when
    ":diffsplit" sets 'foldmethod'.
8   In the fileformat dialog, "Cancel" isn't translated.  Add a global
    variable for this. (Eduardo Fernandez)
9   When editing a file with 'readonly' set, there is no check for an existing
    swap file.  Then using ":write" (without making any changes) doesn't give
    a warning either.  Should check for an existing swap file without creating
    one. Unfinished patch by Ian Kelling, 2008 July 14.
7   When 'showbreak' is set, the amount of space a Tab occupies changes.
    Should work like 'showbreak' is inserted without changing the Tabs.
7   When 'mousefocus' is set and switching to another window with a typed
    command, the mouse pointer may be moved to a part of the window that's
    covered by another window and we lose focus.  Only move in the y
    direction, not horizontally?
8   ":hardcopy":
    - Using the cterm_color[] table is wrong when t_colors is > 16.
    - Need to handle unprintable characters.
    - Win32: On a B&W printer syntax highlighting isn't visible.  Perform
      dithering to make grey text?
    - Add a flag in 'printoptions' to add an empty page to make the total
      number even.  "addempty"? (Mike Williams)
    - Respect 'linebreak'.  Perhaps also 'showbreak'?
    - Should interpret CTRL-L as a page break.
    - Grey line numbers are not always readable.  Add field in 'printoptions'.
      Default to black when no syntax highlighting.
    - Be able to print a window in diff mode.
    - Be able to specify a colorscheme to use for printing.  And a separate
      one for B&W printing (if that can be detected).
8   In Visual block mode with 'lbr' set, a change command doesn't insert the
    text in following lines where the linebreak changes.
8   When 'virtualedit' is "block,insert" and encoding is "utf-8", selecting a
    block of one double-wide character, then "d" deletes only half of it.
8   When 'virtualedit' is set, should "I" in blockwise visual mode also insert
    in lines that don't extend into the block?
8   With 'virtualedit' set, in Insert mode just after the end of line, CTRL-O
    yh does not yank the last character of the line. (Pavel Papushev)
    Doing "hl" first appears to make it work.
8   With 'virtualedit' set it's possible to move into the blank area from
    'linebreak'.
8   With 'virtualedit' set and 'selection' "exclusive", a Visual selection
    that ends in or after a tab, "d" doesn't delete (part of) the tab.
    (Helmut Stiegler)
9   When jumping to a tag, the search pattern is put in the history.  When
    'magic' is on, the pattern may not work.  Translate the pattern depending
    on p_magic when putting it in the history?  Alternative: Store value of
    'magic' in history.  (Margo)
9   optwin.vim: Restoring a mapping for <Space> or <CR> is not correct for
    ":noremap".  Add "mapcmd({string}, {mode})?  Use code from ":mkexrc".
9   incsearch is incorrect for "/that/<Return>/this/;//" (last search pattern
    isn't updated).
9   Get out-of-memory for ":g/^/,$s//@/" on 1000 lines, this is not handled
    correctly.  Get many error messages while redrawing the screen, which
    cause another redraw, etc.
8   [<C-I> doesn't work when '*' is in 'iskeyword'.  find_pattern_in_path()
    must escape special characters in the pattern.
8   Vim can overwrite a read-only file with ":w!".  ":w" can't overwrite an
    existing file, "w!" can, but perhaps not a read-only file?  Then use
    ":w!!" for that.
    Or ask for permission to overwrite it (if file can be made writable) and
    restore file to readonly afterwards.
    Overwriting a file for which a swap file exists is similar issue.
7   X11: Some people prefer to use CLIPBOARD instead of PRIMARY for the normal
    selection.  Add an "xclipboard" argument to the 'clipboard' option? (Mark

8   For xterm need to open a connection to the X server to get the window
    title, which can be slow.  Can also get the title with "<Esc>[21t", no
    need to use X11 calls.  This returns "<Esc>]l{title}<Esc>\".
6   When the xterm reports the number of colors, a redraw occurs.  This is
    annoying on a slow connection.  Wait for the xterm to report the number of
    colors before drawing the screen.  With a timeout.
8   When the builtin xterm termcap contains codes that are not wanted, need a
    way to avoid using the builtin termcap.
8   Xterm sends ^[[H for <Home> and ^[[F for <End> in some mode.  Also
    recognize these keys?  Mostly useful for xterm simulators, like gnometerm.
    See http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.faq.html#xterm_pc_style.
8   For xterm also recognize keypad up/down/left/right and insert.
8   '[ and '] should be set to start/end of line when using a linewise operator
    (e.g., ":w").
8   CTRL-A can't handle big "long" numbers, they become negative.  Check for
    "-" character, if not present, use unsigned long.
8   Make it possible to disable the special meaning of "#" in the first column
    for ">>".
8   Add suspending with CTRL-Z at the "more" prompt, and when executing a long
    script in do_cmdline().
8   When using 'hidden', many swap files will be open.  When Vim runs into the
    maximum number of open files, error messages will appear.  Detect that
    this problem is present, and close any hidden files that don't have
    changes.
8   With 'viminfo' set such that the ".viminfo" file is written on a FAT
    filesystem, an illegal file name may be created: ".vim".
8   For each buffer that is opened, the viminfo file is opened and read to
    check for file marks.  This can be slow.
7   In xterm, recognize both vt100 and vt220 cursor keys.  Change
    add_termcode() to not remove an existing entry for a name, when it's
    needed.
    Need a generic solution to recognize different codes for the same key.
8   Core dump within signal function: gdb doesn't show stack backtrace!  Option
    to skip catch_signals()?
9   Repeating a "cw" with "." doesn't work if the text was pasted from the
    clipboard. (Thomas Jones)  It's because the menu/toolbar item exits Insert
    mode and uses "gP".  How to fix this without breaking inserting a block of
    text?
8   In Replace mode pasting from the clipboard (using menu or toolbar) inserts
    all the text.  Add ":rmenu"?
8   Pasting with the mouse in Replace mode inserts the text, instead of
    overwriting, when it is more than one line.  Same for using <C-R>.
9   CTRL-E and CTRL-Y don't work in small window when 'so' is 4 and lines are
    wrapping (Acevedo/in.226).  E.g., when using CTRL-E, window height 7,
    window might actually scroll down when last line of buffer is displayed.
    --> Remember if the previous command was "cursor follows screen" or
    "screen follow cursor" and use this in cursupdate().
7   tilde_replace() can only handle "~/", should also do "~user/".
    Get the list of home directories (from /etc/passwd?  Use getpwent()) and
    use some clever algorithm to match a path with that.  Find common strings
    in the list?
8   When dragging status line with mouse, sometimes a jump when first clicking
    on the status line (caused by 'winheight').  Select window on button up,
    instead of on button down.
8   Dragging the status line doesn't scroll but redraw.
9   Evaluating 'statusline' in build_stl_str_hl() does not properly check for
    reaching the end of the available buffer.
    Patch to dynamically allocate the buffer for % items. (Eric Arnold, 2006
    May 14)
8   When performing incremental search, should abort searching as soon as a
    character is typed.
8   When the value of $MAKE contains a path, configure can't handle this.
    It's an autoconf bug.  Remove the path from $MAKE to work around it.
8   How to set VIMRC_FILE to \"something\" for configure?  Why does this not
    work: CFLAGS='-DVIMRC_FILE=\"/mydir/myfile\"' ./configure
8   The temporary file is sometimes not writable.  Check for this, and use an
    alternate name when it isn't.  Or add the 'temptemplate' option: template
    for the temp file name ":set temptemplate=/usr/tmp/?????.tmp".
    Also: Win32 version uses Windows temp directory, which might not work for
    cygwin bash.
7   Get error "*, \+ or \( operand could be empty" for pattern "\(.\)\1\{3}".
    Remember flags for backreferences.
7   When switching to Daylight Saving Time, Vim complains that a file has been
    changed since last read.  Can we use a function that uses GMT?
7   When completing an environment variable after a '$', check for file names
    that contain a '$' after all have been found.
8   When "cm" termcap entry is missing, starting gvim shouldn't complain about
    it. (Lohner)  Try out with "vt100" entry, cm replaced with cX.
7   When an include file starts with "../", the check for already visiting
    this file doesn't work.  Need to simplify the file name.
7   The names and comments for the arguments of do_browse() are confusing.
    "dflt" isn't the default file name when "initdir" is not NULL and
    "initdir" is the default path to be used.
7   When 'scrolloff' is exactly half the window height, "j" causes a scroll of
    two lines at a time.  "k" doesn't do this. (Cory T. Echols)
8   When write_viminfo() is used while there are many orphaned viminfo
    tempfiles writing the viminfo file fails.  Give a clear error message so
    that the user knows he has to delete the files.
7   It's possible to redefine a script-local function with ":func
    <SNR>123_Test()". (Krishna)  Disallow this.


I can't reproduce these (if you can, let me know how!):
9   NT 4.0 on NTFS file system: Editing ".bashrc" (drag and drop), file
    disappears.  Editing ".xyz" is OK.  Also, drag&drop only works for three
    files. (McCollister)


Problems that will (probably) not be solved:
-   xterm title: The following scenario may occur (esp. when running the Vim
    test script): Vim 1 sets the title to "file1", then restores the title to
    "xterm" with an ESC sequence when exiting.  Vim 2 obtains the old title
    with an X library call, this may result in "file1", because the window
    manager hasn't processed the "xterm" title yet.  Can apparently only be
    worked around with a delay.
-   In a terminal with 'mouse' set such that the mouse is active when entering
    a command line, after executing a shell command that scrolls up the
    display and then pressing ":": Selecting text with the mouse works like
    the display wasn't scrolled.  Vim doesn't know how much the external
    command scrolled up the display.  Use Shift to select text.
-   X windows: When $DISPLAY points to a X server where there is no access
    permission, trying to connect to the X server causes an error message.
    XtOpenDisplay() prints this directly, there is no way to avoid it.
-   Moving the cursor removes color in color-xterm.  This is a color-xterm
    problem!  color-xterm ver. 6.1 beta 3 and later work properly.
-   In zsh, "gvim&" changes the terminal settings.  This is a zsh problem.
    (Jennings)
-   Problem with HPterm under X: old contents of window is lost (Cosentino).
-   Linux: A file with protection r--rw-rw- is seen readonly for others.  The
    access() function in GNU libc is probably wrong.
-   MSDOS: When using smartdrive with write-back buffering, writing to a
    readonly floppy will cause problems.  How to test for a writable floppy
    first?
-   MSDOS: Both 16 and 32 bit versions: File name expansion doesn't work for
    names that start with a dot.  These used to be illegal file names.
-   When doing a CTRL-Z and typing a command for the shell, while Vim is busy
    (e.g. writing a file), the command for the shell is sometimes eaten by Vim,
    because the terminal mode is changed from RAW to CBREAK.
-   An old version of GNU tgoto can't handle the terminfo code for "AF".  The
    "%p1" is interpreted as "%p" and "1", causing color not to be working.
    Fix: Change the "%p1" in the "AF" and "AB" terminfo entries to "%p".
    (Benzinger).
-   Win32: All files created on the day of switching from winter to summer
    time cause "changed since editing started" messages.  It goes away when
    the file is written again the next day, or the timezone is adjusted.
    Looks like a problem with the Win32 library.
    Rebooting doesn't help.  Time stamps look OK in directory. (Penn)
    Is this on FAT (stores wall clock time) or NTFS (stores UTS)?
-   Win32, MS-Windows XP: $HOME uses the wrong drive when the user profiles
    are not on the boot disk.  This is caused by a wrong value of $HOMEDRIVE.
    This is a bug in XP, see MSKB article 818134.
-   Win32, MS-Windows: expanding plugin/**/*.vim also picks up
    dir/ctags.vim,v.  This is because the short file name is something like
    "ctags~1.vim" and that matches the pattern.
-   When using an xterm that supports the termresponse feature, and the 't_Co'
    termcap option was wrong when Vim started, it will be corrected when the
    termresponse is received.  Since the number of colors changes, the
    highlighting needs to be initialized again.  This may cause colors defined
    in the vimrc file to be lost.
-   On Windows NT 4.0 the number of files passed to Vim with drag&drop and
    "Edit with Vim" is limited.  The maximum command line length is 255 chars.

---------------------  extensions and improvements ----------------------
						    *extensions-improvements*

Most interesting new features to be added when all bugs have been fixed:
-   Using ":exe edit fname" has escaping problems.  Use ":edit ++(fname)".
    Thus use "++=" to give arguments as expressions, comma separated as if
    calling a function.
    With options: ":edit ++(['!', '++enc=abc'], ['+/pat'], fname)".
    Alternative: Make a function for Ex commands: cmd_edit().
-   Add COLUMN NUMBERS to ":" commands ":line1,line2[col1,col2]cmd".  Block
    can be selected with CTRL-V.  Allow '$' (end of line) for col2.
-   Add DEBUGGER INTERFACE.  Implementation for gdb by Xavier de Gaye.
    Should work like an IDE.  Try to keep it generic.  Now found here:
    http://clewn.sf.net.
    And the idevim plugin/script.
    To be able to start the debugger from inside Vim: For GUI run a program
    with a netbeans connection; for console: start a program that splits the
    terminal, runs the debugger in one window and reconnect Vim I/O to the
    other window.
    Wishes for NetBeans commands:
    - make it possible to have 'defineAnnoType' also handle terminal colors.
    - send 'balloonText' events for the cursor position (using CursorHold ?)
      in terminal mode.
-   ECLIPSE plugin.  Problem is: the interface is very complicated.  Need to
    implement part in Java and then connect to Vim.  Some hints from Alexandru
    Roman, 2004 Dec 15.  Should then also work with Oracle Jdeveloper, see JSR
    198 standard http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=198.
    Eclim does it: http://eclim.sourceforge.net/  (Eric Van Dewoestine)
    Plugin that uses a terminal emulator: http://vimplugin.sf.net
    And another one: http://www.satokar.com/viplugin/index.php
-   STICKY CURSOR: Add a way of scrolling that leaves the cursor where it is.
    Especially when using the scrollbar.  Typing a cursor-movement command
    scrolls back to where the cursor is.
-   Scroll commands by screen line. g CTRL-E and g CTRL-Y ?  Requires the
    first line to be able to start halfway through.
8   Add a command to jump to a certain kind of tag.  Allow the user to specify
    values for the optional fields.  E.g., ":tag size type=m".
    Also allow specifying the file and command, so that the result of
    taglist() can be used.
-   X11: Make it possible to run Vim inside a window of another program.
    This can be done with XReparentWindow().  But how exactly?


Documentation:
8   List of Vim runtime directories.  dotvim.txt from Charles Campbell, 2007
    Feb 20.
8   List of options should mention whether environment variables are expanded
    or not.
8   Extend usr_27.txt a bit. (Adam Seyfarth)
7   Add a section on debugging scripts in the user manual.
9   Make the Reference Manual more precise.  For each command mention:
    - change to cursor position and curswant
    - if it can be undone (u/CTRL-R) and redone (.)
    - how it works for folded lines
    - how it works with multi-byte characters
9   In change.txt, remark about Javadoc isn't right.  Right alignment would
    work too.
8   Spread the windows commands over the other files.  For example, ":stag"
    should be with ":tag".  Cross-link with tags to avoid too much double
    text.
8   Add tags for all features, e.g. "gui_running".
7   MS-Windows: When a wrong command is typed with an ALT key, give a hint to
    look at the help for 'winaltkeys'.
7   Add a help.vim plugin that maps <Tab> to jump to the next tag in || and
    <C-Tab> (and <S-Tab>) to the previous tag.
    Patch by Balazs Kezes, 2007 Dec 30.  Remark from A. Politz.
-   Check text editor compendium for vi and Vim remarks.


Help:
-   First try using the ":help" argument literally, before using it as a
    pattern.  And then match it as part of a tag.
-   When a help item has multiple matches make it possible to use ":tn" to go
    to the other matches.
-   Support a way to view (and edit) .info files.
-   Default mapping for help files: <Tab> to position cursor on next |:tag|.
-   Implement a "sticky" help window, some help text lines that are always
    displayed in a window with fixed height. (Guckes)  Use "~/.vimhelp" file,
    user can edit it to insert his favorite commands, new account can contain a
    default contents.
-   Make 'winminheight' a local option, so that the user can set a minimal
    height for the help window (and other windows).
-   ":help :s^I" should expand to ":help :substitute".
-   Make the help key (<F1>) context sensitive?
-   Learn mode: show short help while typing commands.


User Friendlier:
8   Windows install with install.exe: Use .exe instead of .bat files for
    links, so that command line arguments are passed on unmodified? (Walter
    Briscoe)
8   Windows install: Be able to associate Vim with a selection of file types?
8   Windows uninstall: Have uninstal.c delete the vimfiles directories that
    dosinst.c creates.  List the contents of the directory (recursively) if
    the user asks for it.  Requires an implementation of "rm -rf".
8   Remember the name of the vimrc file that was used (~/.vimrc, $VIM/_vimrc,
    $HOME/_vimrc, etc.) and add "edit vimrc" to the File menu.
-   Add a way to save local settings and mappings into a new plugin file.
    ":mkplugin <file>"?
8   Add ":plugininstall" command.  Can be used to install a plugin file that
    includes documentation.  Let the user select a directory from
    'runtimepath'.
	" Vim plugin
	<main plugin code>
	" >>> plugin help start <<<
	<plugin docs>
-   Add mappings local to a window: ":map <window> ..."?
9   Add buffer-local menu.  Should offer a choice between removing the menu or
    disabling it.  Be careful that tear-offs don't disappear (keep one empty
    item?).
    Alternative: use BufEnter and BufLeave autocommands.
7   Add the arguments for configure to the ":version" output?
7   When Vim detects a file is being edited elsewhere and it's a gvim session
    of the same user it should offer a "Raise" button, so that the other gvim
    window can be displayed. (Eduard)


Tab pages:
9   GUI implementation for the tab pages line for other systems.
7   GUI: Control over the appearance of the text in the labels (bold, color,
    font, etc.)
8   Make GUI menu in tab pages line configurable.  Like the popup menu.
8   balloons for the tab page labels that are shortened to show the full path.
7   :tabdup	 duplicate the tab with all its windows.
7   Option to put tab line at the left or right?  Need an option to specify
    its width.  It's like a separate window with ":tabs" output.
7   Add local variables for each tab page?
8   Add local options for each tab page?  E.g., 'diffopt' could differ between
    tab pages.
7   Add local highlighting for each tab page?
7   Add local directory for tab pages?  How would this interfere with
    window-local directories?


Spell checking:
-   Support more regions? Caolan McNamara argues it's needed for es_XX.
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=219777    
-   Unicode defines another quote character: 0x2019.  Use it as an equivalent
    of a single quote, thus use it as a word character like a quote and match
    with words, replacing the curly quote with a single quote.
-   Could filter &eacute; things for HTML before doing spell checking.
    Similarly for TeX.
-   The Hungarian spell file uses four extra characters in the FOL/UPP/LOW
    items than other spell files with the ISO-8859-2 encoding, that causes
    problem when changing 'spelllang'.  There is no obvious way to fix this.
-   Considering Hunspell 1.1.4:
    What does MAXNGRAMSUGS do?
    Is COMPLEXPREFIXES necessary when we have flags for affixes?
-   Support spelling words in CamelCase as if they were two separate words.
    Requires some option to enable it. (Timothy Knox)
-   There is no Finnish spell checking file.  For openoffice Voikko is now
    used, which is based on Malaga: http://home.arcor.de/bjoern-beutel/malaga/
    (Teemu Likonen)
8   ":mkspell" still takes much too long in Hungarian dictionary from
    hunspell.  Only solution appears to be to postpone secondary suffixes.
8   Handle postponed prefix with COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG or COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG.
    WFP_COMPPERMIT and WFP_COMPFORBID
8   implement use of <compoptions> in .spl file:
    implement CHECKCOMPOUNDREP: when a compound word seems to be OK apply REP
    items and check if the result is a valid word.
    implement CHECKCOMPOUNDDUP
    implement CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE
    Add CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE: when compounding make leading capital lower case.
    How is it supposed to work?
-   Add a command the repeats ]s and z=, showing the misspelled word in its
    context.  Thus to spell-check a whole file.
-   suggestion for "KG" to "kg" when it's keepcase.
-   For flags on affixes: Use a "AFFCOMPSET" flag; means the compound flags of
    the word are not used.
-   Support breakpoint character ? 0xb7 and ignore it?  Makes it possible to
    use same wordlist for hyphenation.
-   Compound word is accepted if nr of words is <= COMPOUNDWORDMAX OR nr of
    syllables <= COMPOUNDSYLMAX.  Specify using AND in the affix file?
-   NEEDCOMPOUND also used for affix?  Or is this called ONLYINCOMPOUND now?
    Or is ONLYINCOMPOUND only for inside a compound, not at start or end?
-   Do we need a flag for the rule that when compounding is done the following
    word doesn't have a capital after a word character, even for Onecap words?
-   New hunspell home page: http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/
    - Version 1.1.0 is out now, look into that.
    - Lots of code depends on LANG, that isn't right.  Enable each mechanism
      in the affix file separately.
    - Example with compounding dash is bad, gets in the way of setting
      COMPOUNDMIN and COMPOUNDWORDMAX to a reasonable value.
    - PSEUDOROOT == NEEDAFFIX
    - COMPOUNDROOT -> COMPOUNDED?  For a word that already is a compound word
	    Or use COMPOUNDED2, COMPOUNDED3, etc.
-   CIRCUMFIX: when a word uses a prefix marked with the CIRCUMFIX flag, then
    the word must also have a suffix marked with the CIRCUMFIX flag.  It's a
    bit primitive, since only one flag is used, which doesn't allow matching
    specific prefixes with suffixes.
    Alternative:
	PSFX {flag} {pchop} {padd} {pcond} {schop} {sadd}[/flags] {scond}
    We might not need this at all, you can use the NEEDAFFIX flag and the
    affix which is required.
-   When a suffix has more than one syllable, it may count as a word for
    COMPOUNDWORDMAX.
-   Add flags to count extra syllables in a word.  SYLLABLEADD1 SYLLABLEADD2,
    etc.?  Or make it possible to specify the syllable count of a word
    directly, e.g., after another slash: /abc/3
-   MORPHO item in affix file: ignore TAB and morphological field after
    word/flags and affix.
-   Implement multiple flags for compound words and CMP item?
    Await comments from other spell checking authors.
-   Also see tklspell: http://tkltrans.sourceforge.net/
8   Charles Campbell asks for method to add "contained" groups to existing
    syntax items (to add @Spell).
    Add ":syntax contains {pattern} add=@Spell" command?  A bit like ":syn
    cluster" but change the contains list directly for matching syntax items.
-   References: MySpell library (in OpenOffice.org).

      author: Kevin Hendricks <kevin.hendricks@sympatico.ca>
8   It is currently not possible to mark "can not" as rare, because "can" and
    "not" are good words.  Find a way to let "rare" overrule "good"?
8   Make "en-rare" spell file?  Ask Charles Campbell.
8   The English dictionaries for different regions are not consistent in their
    use of words with a dash.
7   Insert mode completion mechanism that uses the spell word lists.
8   Add hl groups to 'spelllang'?
	:set spelllang=en_us,en-rare/SpellRare,en-math/SpellMath
    More complicated: Regions with different languages?  E.g., comments
    in English, strings in German (po file).


Diff mode:
9   When making small changes, e.g. deleting a character, update the diff.
    Possibly without running diff.
9   Instead invoking an external diff program, use builtin code.  One can be
    found here: http://www.ioplex.com/~miallen/libmba/dl/src/diff.c
    It's quite big and badly documented though.
8   Use diff mode to show the changes made in a buffer (compared to the file).
    Use an unnamed buffer, like doing:
	new | set bt=nofile | r # | 0d_ | diffthis | wincmd p | diffthis
    Also show difference with the file when editing started?  Should show what
    can be undone. (Tom Popovich)
7   Add cursor-binding: when moving the cursor in one diff'ed buffer, also
    move it in other diff'ed buffers, so that CTRL-W commands go to the same
    location.


Folding:
    (commands still available: zI zJ zK zp zP zq zQ zV zy zY;
    secondary: zB zS zT zZ, z=)
8   Vertical folds: looks like vertically split windows, but the cursor moves
    through the vertical separator, separator moves when scrolling.
8   Add "z/" and "z?" for searching in not folded text only.
9   Add search pattern item to only match in closed or open fold and/or fold
    with certain level.  Allows doing ":g/pat/cmd" to work on closed folds.
8   When a closed fold is displayed open because of 'foldminlines', the
    behavior of commands is still like the fold is closed.  How to make the
    user aware of this?
8   Add an option 'foldskip' with values like 'foldopen' that specifies which
    commands skip over a closed fold.
8   "H" and "L" count buffer lines instead of window lines. (Servatius Brandt)
8   Add a way to add fold-plugins.  Johannes Zellner has one for VB.
7   When using manual folding, the undo command should also restore folds.
-   Allow completely hiding a closed fold.  E.g., by setting 'foldtext' to an
    empty string.  Require showing a character in 'foldcolumn' to avoid the
    missing line goes unnoticed.
    How to implement this?
-   When pressing the down arrow of a scrollbar, a closed fold doesn't scroll
    until after a long time.  How to make scrolling with closed folds
    smoother?
-   When creating a session, also store folds for buffers in the buffer list,
    using the wininfo in wi_folds.
-   When currently editing the first file in the argument list the session
    file can contain:
	args version.c main.c
	edit version.c
    Can editing version.c twice be avoided?
-   'foldmethod' "textobject": fold on sections and paragraph text objects.
-   "zuf": undo change in manual fold. "zUf" redo change in manual fold.  How
    to implement this?
-   "zJ" command: add the line or fold below the fold in the fold under the
    cursor.
-   'foldmethod' "syntax": "fold=3" argument: set fold level for a region or
    match.
-   Apply a new foldlevel to a range of lines. (Steve Litt)
8   Have some way to restrict commands to not folded text.  Also commands like
    searches.


Multi-byte characters:
-   When editing a file with both utf-8 and latin1 text Vim always falls back
    to latin1.  Add a command to convert the latin1 characters to utf-8?
	:unmix utf-8,latin1 filename
    Would only work when 'encoding' is utf-8.
9   When the tail byte of a double-byte character is illegal (e.g., a CR), the
    display is messed up (Yasuhiro Matsumoto).  Should check for illegal
    double-byte characters and display them differently (display each single
    byte).
9   'fenc' in modeline problem: add option to reload the file when 'fenc' is
    set to a different value in a modeline?  Option can be default on.  Could
    it be done with an autocommand?
8   Add an item in 'fileencodings' to check the first lines of a file for
    the encoding.  See Python PEP: http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html.
    To avoid getting a wrong encoding only accept something Emacs-like:
    "-*- coding: enc-na_me.foo -*-" and "-*- coding= enc-na_me.foo -*-"
    Match with "-\*-\s*coding[:=]\s*\([::word::-_.]\+\)\s*-\*-" and use first
    item.
8   Add an item in 'fileencodings' to check the first line of an XML file for
    the encoding.  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  Or "charset=UTF-8"?
    For HTML look for "charset=utf-8".
8   The quickfix file is read without conversion, thus in 'encoding'.  Add an
    option to specify the encoding of the errorfile and convert it.  Also for
    ":grep" and ":helpgrep".
    More generic solution: support a filter (e.g., by calling a function).
8   When a file was converted from 'fileencoding' to 'encoding', a tag search
    should also do this on the search pattern. (Andrzej M. Ostruszka)
8   When filtering changes the encoding 'fileencoding' may not work.  E.g.,
    when using xxd and 'fileencoding' is "utf-16".  Add an option to set a
    different fileencoding for filter output?
7   When converting a file fails, mention which byte could not be converted,
    so that the user can fix the problem.
8   Add configure option to be able to disable using the iconv library. (Udo
    Schweigert)
9   'aleph' should be set to 1488 for Unicode. (Zvi Har'El)
8   Should add test for using various commands with multi-byte characters.
8   'infercase' doesn't work with multi-byte characters.
8   toupper() function doesn't handle byte count changes.
7   Searching and composing characters:
    When searching, should order of composing characters be ignored?
    Add a special item to match with a composing character, so that composing
    characters can be manipulated.
8   Should implement 'delcombine' for command line editing.
8   Detect overlong UTF-8 sequences and handle them like illegal bytes.
8   ":s/x/\u\1/" doesn't work, making uppercase isn't done for multi-byte
    characters.
8   UTF-8: "r" in Visual mode doesn't take composing characters.
8   UTF-8: When there is a precomposed character in the font, use it instead
    of a character and a composing character.  See xterm for an example.
7   When a character can't be displayed, display its digraph instead.
    'display' option to specify this.
7   Use ideas for nl_langinfo() from Markus Kuhn in enc_default():
    (www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/langinfo.c)
-   dbcs_class() only works for Japanese and Korean.  Implement this for
    other encodings.  The "euc-jp" and "euc-kr" choices might be wrong.
-   Find some way to automatically select the right GUI font or fontset,
    depending on the default value of 'encoding'.
    Irrelevant in the GTK+ 2 GUI so long as UTF-8 is used.
    For Windows, the charset_pairs[] table could be used.  But how do we know
    if a font exists?
-   Do keyboard conversion from 'termencoding' to 'encoding' with
    convert_input() for Mac GUI.
-   Add mnemonics from RFC1345 longer than two characters.
    Support CTRL-K _{mnemonic}_
7   In "-- INSERT (lang) --" show the name of the keymap used instead of
    "lang". (Ilya Dogolazky)
-   Make 'breakat' accept multi-byte characters.  Problem: can't use a lookup
    table anymore (breakat_flags[]).
    Simplistic solution: when 'formatoptions' contains "m" also break a line
    at a multi-byte character >= 0x100.
-   Add the possibility to enter mappings which are used whenever normal text
    could be entered.  E.g., for "f" command.  But not in Normal mode.  Sort
    of opposite of 'langmap'.  Use ":tmap" command?
-   When breaking a line, take properties of multi-byte characters into
    account.  The "linebreak" program from Bruno Haible can do it:
    ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/gnu/linebreak-0.1.tar.gz
    But it's very complicated...


Printing:
7   Implement "undercurl" for printing.
-   Add "page width" to wrap long lines.
-   Win32: use a font dialog for setting 'printfont'.  Can reuse the code for
    the 'guifont' dialog, put the common code in a separate function.
-   Add the file timestamp to the page header (with an option). (George
    Reilly)
-   Win32: when 'printfont' is empty use 'guifont'.
-   Unix: Use some dialog box to do the obvious settings (paper size, printer
    name, portrait/landscape, etc).
-   PostScript: Only works for text that can be converted to an 8-bit
    character set.  How to support Unicode fully?
-   Allow specifying the paper size, instead of using a standard size.  Same
    units as for the margins.
-   Support right-to-left text?
8   Make the foreground color darkening function preserve the hue of the
    color.


Syntax highlighting:
8   Make ":syn off" use 'runtimepath' instead of $VIMRUNTIME. (Gary Johnson)
    Should do the same for ":syn on" and ":syn manual".
8   Support "containedin" argument for ":syn include", so that the defined
    cluster can be added to existing syntax items.
8   C syntax: Don't highlight {} as errors inside () when used like this:
    "({ something })", often used in GCC code.
7   Add a "startgroup" to a region.  Used like "nextgroup" inside the region,
    preferred item at the start of the region. (Charles Campbell)
8   When editing a new file without a name and giving it a name (by writing
    it) and 'filetype' is not set, detect the filetype.  Avoid doing it for
    ":wq file".
7   For "nextgroup" we have skipwhite, skipnl and skipempty.  It would be
    really nice to be able to skip with a pattern.  Or skip with a syntax
    group. (Nikolai Weibull, 2007 Feb 27)
8   Make conversion to HTML faster (Write it in C or pre-compile the script).
9   There is still a redraw bug somewhere.  Probably because a cached state is
    used in a wrong way.  I can't reproduce it...
7   Be able to change only the background highlighting.  Useful for Diff* and
    Search highlighting.
7   When 'number' is set highlight the number of the current line.
    Must be enabled with an option, because it slows down display updating.
8   Allow the user to add items to the Syntax menu sorted, without having to
    change this for each release.
8   Add a "matchcontains" for regions: items contained in the start or end
    pattern, but not in the body.
8   Add a "keepend-contained" argument: Don't change the end of an item this
    one is contained in.  Like "keepend" but specified on the contained item,
    instead of the containing item.
8   cpp.vim: In C++ it's allowed to use {} inside ().
8   Some syntax files set 'iskeyword'.  When switching to another filetype
    this isn't reset.  Add a special keyword definition for the syntax rules?
    When this is done, use vim.vim syntax highlighting for help file examples,
    but without ":" in 'iskeyword' for syntax.
    Also need a separate 'iskeyword' for the command line, e.g., in a help
    window ":e /asdf/asdf/" CTRL-W works different.
8   Add specific syntax item to match with parens/braces that don't have a
    "%" match.  :syntax nomatch cMatchError (,{,[,),},] [contained]
8   Highlight the text between two matching parens (e.g., with a grey
    background) when on one of the parens or in between them.
    Option for the matchparen plugin?
8   When using a cterm, and no ctermfg or ctermbg are defined, use start/stop
    sequences.	Add remark in docs that :if 'term' == "term-name" should be
    used.
8   Add @spell cluster to String and Comment groups for many languages.  Will
    allow spell checking. (Fleiner)
8   When listing syntax items, try to sort the keywords alphabetically.  And
    re-insert the [] if possible.
8   Make it possible to use color of text for Visual highlight group (like for
    the Cursor).
8   It would be useful to make the highlight group name an expression.  Then
    when there is a match, the expression would be evaluated to find out what
    highlight group to use.  Could be used to check if the shell used in a
    password file appears in /etc/shells. (Nikolai Weibull)
	syn match =s:checkShell(v:match) contained 'pattern'
8   Make it possible to only highlight a sub-expression of a match.  Like
    using "\1" in a ":s" command.
8   Support for deleting syntax items:
    :syn keyword cTodo remove this
    :syn match cTodo remove "pattern"
    :syn region cString remove start="this" end="that"
8   Add possibility to sync on something else, when the syncing in one way
    doesn't find match.  For HTML: When no {script} is found, try looking for
    a '<'.  (Fleiner)
7   Replace the synchronizing method with a state machine specification?
    Should be able to start at any line in the file, search forwards or
    backwards, and use the result of matching a pattern.
7   Use parsing like awk, so that e.g., a ( without a matching ) can be
    detected.
8   Make it possible to use "inverted" highlighting, invert the original
    character.  For Visual mode.  (xterm-selection already does this).
8   Highlight non-printable characters with "SpecialChar", linked to
    "Special".  Display them with the digraph characters, if possible.
8   Highlight the clipboard-selection with a highlight group.
8   Be able to reset highlighting to its original (default) values.
7   Be able to write current highlighting to a file as commands, similar to
    ":mkvimrc".
8   Improve c.vim:
    - Add check for unterminated strings, with a variable to switch it on:
      "c_strict_ansi".
    - Detect unbalanced "#endif".  Requires looking back a long way...
8   Add an option to restrict the updating of syntax highlighting to the
    current line while in Insert mode.
8   When guessing value of 'background', the syntax file has already been
    loaded (from the .gvimrc).	After changing 'background', load it again?
8   Add ":syn resync" command, to re-parse the whole file until the current
    display position.
8   Should support "me" offset for a region start pattern.  To be used to
    allow searching for the end pattern inside the match of the end pattern.
    Example: syn region pikeXX start="([^{]" end=")" should work on "()".
8   When using a regexp for "contains=", should delay matching with it until
    redrawing happens.  Set a flag when a group is added, check this flag when
    highlighting starts.
8   Some terminals can display colors like the GUI.  Add some setting to use
    GUI colors for the terminal?  With something to define the escape
    sequence.
7   It's possible for an item to be transparent, so that the colors of an item
    lower on the stack is used.  Also do this with highlighting, so that the
    user can set transparent highlighting?  E.g. a number in a C comment would
    get the color of a comment, a number in an assignment Normal. (Nikolai
    Weibull)
7   Add "semitrans": Add highlighting.  E.g., make the text bold, but keep the
    colors.  And add colors, so that Green+Red becomes Yellow.
    E.g. for this html:
	<B> bold text <I> italic+bold text </B> italic text </I>
7   CTRL-] checks the highlight group for finding out what the tag is.
7   Add an explanation how a list of words can be used to highlight misspelled
    words.
8   Add more command line completion for :syntax.
8   Add more command line completion for :highlight.
7   Should find a better way to parse the :syntax and :highlight commands.
    Use tables or lists that can be shared by parsing for execution and
    completion?
8   Add ColorSchemePost autocommand event, so that scripts can set up their
    highlighting. (Salman Halim)
7   Add a few sets of colors (e.g. Borland Turbo C one).  With a menu to
    select one of the sets.
8   Add offsets to sub-matches: "\(a*\) *"he=e1-1
    'e' is end of match 'e1' is end of sub-match 1, 's2' is start of submatch
    2, etc.
8   In Insert mode, when there are typeahead characters, postpone the
    highlighting (for "." command).
8   Syncing on comments isn't 100% correct when / / lines mix with / * and * /.
    For example: What about a line that starts with / / and contains * /?
8   Ignore / * and  * / inside strings, when syncing.
7   Build a few more syntax files from the file "/usr/share/misc/vgrindefs":
    ISP, LDL, Icon, ratfor.  And check "nedit/source/highlight.c".
6   Add possibility to have background color continue until the right edge of
    the window.  Useful for comment blocks and function headings. (Rogall)
-   Make it possible to add "contains" items for all items in a group.	Useful
    when extending an already existing syntax file.
-   Add line-continuation pattern for non-syncing items too?
-   Add possibility to highlight the whole line, including the right margin
    (for comment blocks).
-   Add 'hlmatch' option: List of flags:
    'c': highlight match for character under the cursor.
    'b': highlight the previous (, and its match.
    'a': highlight all text from the previous ( until its match.
	 Also for {}, <>, etc.?
    'e': highlight all braces without a match (slow?)
    OR: add an argument "cursor" to the syntax command, which means that the
    region/match/keyword is only highlighted when the cursor is on it.
    (Campbell)
    Or do it like Elvis: define text objects and how to highlight them around
    the cursor. (Iain Truskett)
7   Make it possible to use all words in the tags files as Keyword.
    Can also be done with a script (but it's slow).
7   Make it possible to call a ":" command when a match is found.  Should
    allow for adding keywords from the text (e.g. variables that are set).
    And allows for sections with different highlighting.
7   Add highlight group for commandline: "Commandline".  Make sure it
    highlights the command line while typing a command, and any output from
    messages.  And external commands?
8   Make a version that works like less, but with highlighting: read stdin for
    text, exit at end of file, don't allow editing, etc.  moreim?  lessim?
7   SpecialKey highlighting overrules syntax highlighting.  Can't give an
    unprintable char another color.  Would be useful for ^M at end of line.


Built-in script language:
8   Make the filename and line number available to script functions, so that
    they can give useful debugging info.  The whole call stack would be ideal.
    At least use this for error messages.
7   Execute a function with standard option values.  No need to save and
    restore option values.  Especially useful for new options.  Problem: how
    to avoid a performance penalty (esp. for string options)?
8   Add referring to key options with "&t_xx".  Both for "echo &t_xx" and
    ":let &t_xx =".  Useful for making portable mappings.
-   Add ":let var ?= value", conditional assignment.  Patch by Dave Eggum,
    2006 Dec 11.
-   range for ":exec", pass it on to the executed command.  (Webb)
8   ":{range}source": source the lines from the current file.
	You can already yank lines and use :@" to execute them.
	Most of do_source() would not be used, need a new function.
	It's easy when not doing breakpoints or profiling.
    Requires copying the lines into a list and then creating a function to
    execute lines from the list.  Similar to getnextac().
7   ":include" command: just like ":source" but doesn't start a new scriptID?
    Will be tricky for the list of script names.
8   Have a look at VSEL.  Would it be useful to include? (Bigham)
8   Add ":fungroup" command, to group function definitions together.  When
    encountered, all functions in the group are removed.  Suggest using an
    obscure name to avoid name clashes.  Require a ":fungroup END" in the same
    sourced file?  Assume the group ends at the end of the file.  Handle
    nested packages?
    Alternative: Support packages.  {package-name}:{function-name}().
    Packages are loaded automatically when first used, from
    $VIMRUNTIME/packages (or use a search path).
7   Pre-parse or compile Vim scripts into a bytecode.
    1. Put the bytecode with the original script, with an ":if
       has('bytecode')" around it, so that it's only used with a Vim that
       supports it.  Update the code with a command, can be used in an
       autocommand.
    2. Use a ".vic" file (like Python use .pyc).  Create it when writing a
       .vim file.  Problem: distribution.
    3. Use a cache directory for each user.  How to recognize which cached
       file belongs to a sourced script?
7   Add argument to winwidth() to subtract the space taken by 'foldcolumn',
    signs and/or 'number'.
6   Add ++ and -- operators?  They only work on variables (lvals), how to
    implement this?
8   Add functions:
	has(":command")		Check if ":command" works.  compare function
				with "ex_ni".  E.g. for ":simalt".
	system()		With a List argument.  Bypasses the shell, use
				exec() directly.  (Bob Hiestand)
	escape()		Add argument to specify what to escape with.
	modestack()		Instead of just the current mode return the
				stack of Insert / CTRL-O / :normal things.
	realname()		Get user name (first, last, full)
				user_fullname() patch by Nikolai Weibull, Nov
				3 2002
				Only add this when also implemented for
				non-Unix systems, otherwise a shell cmd could
				be used.
				get_user_name() gets login name.
	menuprop({name}, {idx}, {what})
				Get menu property of menu {name} item {idx}.
				menuprop("", 1, "name") returns "File".
				menuprop("File", 1, "n") returns "nmenu
				File.Open..." argument.
				Patch by Ilya Sher, 2004 Apr 22
				Return a list of menus and/or a dictionary
				with properties instead.
	mapname({idx}, mode)	return the name of the idx'th mapping.
				Patch by Ilya Sher, 2004 Mar 4.
				Return a list instead.
	char2hex()		convert char string to hex string.
	base64enc()		base 64 encoding
	base64dec()		base 64 decoding
	attributes()		return file protection flags "drwxrwxrwx"
	filecopy(from, to)	Copy a file
	shorten(fname)		shorten a file name, like home_replace()
	perl(cmd)		call Perl and return string
	inputrl()		like input() but right-to-left
	typed()			return the characters typed and consumed (to
				find out what happened)
	virtualmode()		add argument to obtain whether "$" was used in
				Visual block mode.
	getacp()		Win32: get codepage (Glenn Maynard)
	deletebufline()		delete line in any buffer
	appendbufline()		append line in any buffer
	libcall()		Allow more than one argument.
	libcallext()		Like libcall(), but using a callback function
				to allow the library to execute a command or
				evaluate an expression.
7   Make bufname("'0") return the buffer name from mark '0.  How to get the
    column and line number?  col("'0") currently returns zero.
8   argc() returns 0 when using "vim -t tag".  How to detect that no file was
    specified in any way?  To be able to jump to the last edited file.
8   Pass the command line arguments to Vim scripts in some way.  As v:args
    List?  Or extra parameter to argv()?
8   Add command arguments with three dashes, passed on to Vim scripts.
7   Add optional arguments to user functions:
	:func myFunc(arg1, arg2, arg3 = "blah", arg4 = 17)
6   User functions: Functions local to buffer "b:func()"?
8   For Strings add ":let var[{expr}] = {expr}".  When past the end of "var"
    just ignore.
8   The "= register should be writable, if followed by the name of a variable,
    option or environment variable.
8   ":let &option" should list the value of the option.
8   ":let Func().foo = value" should work, also when "foo" doesn't exist.
    Also: ":let Func()[foo] = value" should work.  Same for a List.
7   Add synIDlist(), making the whole list of syntax items on the syntax stack
    available as a List.
8   Add autocommand-event for when a variable is changed:
	:au VarChanged {varname} {commands}
8   Add "has("gui_capable")", to check if the GUI can be started.
8   Add possibility to use variables like registers: characterwise (default),
    linewise (when ending in '\n'), blockwise (when ending in '\001').	reg0,
    rega, reg%, etc.  Add functions linewise({expr}), blockwise({expr}) and
    charwise({expr}).
7   Make it possible to do any command on a string variable (make a buffer
    with one line, containing the string).  Maybe add an (invisible) scratch
    buffer for this?
	result = scratch(string, command)
	result = apply(string, command)
	result = execute(string, command)
    "command" would use <> notation.
    Does scratch buffer have a number?  Or re-use same number?
7   Add function to generate unique number (date in milliseconds).


Robustness:
6   Add file locking.  Lock a file when starting to edit it with flock() or
    fcntl().  This patch has advisory file locking while reading/writing
    the file for Vim 5.4: ~/vim/patches/kahn_file_locking .
    The patch is incomplete (needs support for more systems, autoconf).
    Andy doesn't have time to work on it.
    Disadvantage: Need to find ways to gracefully handle failure to obtain a
    lock.  When to release a lock: When buffer is unloaded?


Performance:
7   For string variables up to 3 bytes don't allocate memory, use v_list
    itself as a character array.  Use VAR_SSTRING (short string).
7   Add 'lazysize' option: Above this size Vim doesn't load everything before
    starting to edit a file.  Things like 'fileencodings' only work up to this
    size, modelines only work at the top.  Useful for large log files where
    you only want to look at the first few pages.  Use zero to disable it.
8   move_lines() copies every line into allocated memory, making reloading a
    buffer a lot slower than re-editing the file.  Can the memline be locked
    so that we don't need to make a copy?  Or avoid invoking ml_updatechunk(),
    that is taking a lot of time.  (Ralf Wildenhues, 2008 Jul 7)
    With a patch, but does it work?
8   Instead of loading rgb.txt every time a color wasn't recognized load it
    once and keep it in memory.  Move the code to a common place to avoid
    repeating it in various system files.
8   Turn b_syn_ic and b_syn_containedin into b_syn_flags.
9   Loading menu.vim still takes quite a bit of time.  How to make it faster?
8   in_id_list() takes much time for syntax highlighting.  Cache the result?
7   setpcmark() shifts the jumplist, this takes quite a bit of time when
    jumping around.  Instead use an index for the start?
8   When displaying a space with only foreground highlighting, it's the same
    as a space without attributes.  Avoid displaying spaces for the "~" lines
    when starting up in a color terminal.
8   Profiling shows that in_id_list() is used very often for C code.  Can this
    function be improved?
8   For an existing file, the page size of the swap file is always the
    default, instead of using the block size of the device, because the swap
    file is created only after setting the block size in mf_open().  How can
    this be improved?
7   C syntax highlighting gets a lot slower after ":set foldmethod=syntax".
    (Charles Campbell)  Inserting a "{" is very slow. (dman)
7   HTML syntax highlighting is slow for long lines.  Try displaying
    http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/22908.html. (Andre Pang)
7   Check how performance of loading the wordlist can be improved (adding a
    lot of abbreviations).
7   MS-DOS console: Add t_DL support, to make scrolling faster.
7   Compile Ex commands to byte codes.  Store byte codes in a vim script file
    at the end, after "compiled:.  Make it look like a single comment line
    for old Vim versions.  Insert first line "Vim script compiled <timestamp>.
    Only used compiled code when timestamp matches the file stat.
    Add command to compile a vim script and add it to the file in-place.
    Split Ex command executing into a parsing and executing phase.
    Use compiled code for functions, while loops, etc.
8   When defining autocommands (e.g., from $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim), need to
    compare each pattern with all existing patterns.  Use a hash code to avoid
    using strcmp() too often?
7   Include turbo_loader patches, speeding up reading a file?
    Speed up reading a file by reading it into a fixed-size buffer, creating
    the list of indexes in another buffer, and then copying the result into a
    memfile block with two copies.  Then read the next block into another
    fixed-size buffer, create the second list of indexes and copy text from
    the two blocks to the memfile block.
7   do_cmdline(): Avoid that the command line is copied to allocated memory
    and freed again later all the time.  For while loops, and for when called
    with an argument that can be messed with.
    Generic solution: Make a struct that contains a pointer and a flag that
    indicates if the pointer should be freed when replaced.
7   Check that the file size is not more than "sizeof(long)".
-   Further improve finding mappings in maphash[] in vgetorpeek()
8   Syntax highlighting is slow when deleting lines.  Try in
    $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim.
-   "out of memory" after deleting (1,$d) and changing (:%s/^/> /) a lot of
    lines (27000) a few times.  Memory fragmentation?
-   Have a look at how pdksh does memory allocation (alloc.c). (Dalecki)
-   Do profiling on:
    - :g/pat/normal cmd
    - 1000ii<Esc>
    - deleting 10Mbyte worth of lines (netscape binary)
    - "[i" and "[d" (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
    - ":g/^/m0" on a 450Kbyte file.  And the "u".
    - highlighting "~/vim/test/longline.tex", "~/vim/test/scwoop.tcl" and
      "~/vim/test/lockup.pl".
    - loading a syntax file to highlight all words not from a dictionary.
    - editing a Vim script with syntax highlighting on (loading vim.vim).
7   Screen updating can be further improved by only redrawing lines that were
    changed (and lines after them, when syntax highlighting was used, and it
    changed).
    - On each change, remember start and end of the change.
    - When inserting/deleting lines, remember begin, end, and line count.
-   Use macros/duarte/capicua for profiling.  Nvi 1.71 is the fastest!
-   When using a file with one long line (1Mbyte), then do "$hhhh", is still
    very slow.  Avoid calling getvcol() for each "h"?
-   Executing a register, e.g. "10000@@" is slow, because ins_typebuf has to
    move the previous commands forward each time.  Pass count from
    normal_cmd() down to do_execreg().
-   Repeating insert "1000i-<Esc>" displays --INSERT-- all the time, because of
    the <Esc> at the end.  Make this work faster (disable redrawing).
-   Avoid calls to plines() for cursor line, use w_cline_height.
-   After ":set nowrap" remove superfluous redraw with wrong hor. offset if
    cursor is right of the screen.
8   Make CTRL-C on Unix generate a signal, avoid using select() to check for a
    CTRL-C (it's slow).


Code size:
8   GUI: When NO_CONSOLE is defined, more code can be excluded.
-   Put getline() and cookie in a struct, so only one argument has to be
    passed to do_cmdline() and other functions.
8   Make a GUI-only version for Unix?
8   In buf_write _() isn't needed when setting errmsg, do it once when using
    it.
7   When compiling with a GUI-only version, the code for cterm colors can be
    left out.
8   When compiled with a GUI-only version, the termcap entries for terminals
    can be removed.
8   Can the check for libelf in configure.in be removed?


Messages:
8   When using ":q" in a changed file, the error says to "add !".  Add the
    command so that beginners understand it: "use :q!".
8   For 'verbose' level 12 prints commands from source'ed files.  How to skip
    lines that aren't executed?  Perhaps move the echoing to do_cmdline()?
8   Use 'report' for ":bdel"?  (Krishna)  To avoid these messages when using a
    script.
-   Delete message after new command has been entered and have waited for key.
    Perhaps after ten seconds?
-   Make message history available in "msg" variables: msg1, msg2, .. msg9.
8   When reading from stdin allow suppressing the "reading from stdin"
    message.
9   Check handling of overwriting of messages and delays:
    Very wrong: errors while redrawing cause endless loop.
    When switching to another file and screen scrolls because of the long
    message and return must be typed, don't scroll the screen back before
    redrawing.
8   When address range is wrong you only get "Invalid range".  Be a bit more
    specific: Negative, beyond last line, reverse range?  Include the text.
8   Make it possible to ignore errors for a moment ('errorignore'?).  Another
    option to switch off giving error messages ('errorquiet'?).  Also an option
    not to give any messages ('quiet')?  Or ":quiet on", ":quiet off".
    Careful: For a severe error (out of memory), and when the user starts
    typing, error messages must be switched back on.
    Also a flag to ignore error messages for shell commands (for mappings).
-   Option to set time for emsg() sleep.  Interrupt sleep when key is typed?
    Sleep before second message?
8   In Ex silent mode or when reading commands from a file, what exactly is
    not printed and what is?  Check ":print", ":set all", ":args", ":vers",
    etc.  At least there should be no prompt. (Smulders)  And don't clear the
    screen when reading commands from stdin. (Kendall)
    --> Make a difference between informative messages, prompts, etc. and
	error messages, printing text, etc.
8   Window should be redrawn when resizing at the hit-enter prompt.
    Also at the ":tselect" prompt.  Find a generic solution for redrawing when
    a prompt is present (with a callback function?).


Screen updating:
7   Add a string to the 'display' option to make CTRL-E and CTRL-Y scroll one
    screen line, also if this means the first line doesn't start with the
    first character (like what happens with a single line that doesn't fit).
-   screen_line():
    - insert/delete character stuff.
    - improve delete rest of line (spaces at end of line).
-   When moving or resizing window, try to avoid a complete redraw (esp. when
    dragging the status line with the mouse).
-   When 'lazyredraw' set, don't echo :ex commands?  Need a flag to redraw when
    waiting for a character.
8   Add a ":refresh [winnr]" command, to force updating a window.  Useful from
    an event handler where ":normal" can't be used.  Also useful when
    'lazyredraw' is set in a mapping.
7   Make 'list' and 'linebreak' work together.


Scrolling:
8   Add "zy" command: scroll horizontally to put the cursor in the middle.
6   Add option to set the overlap for CTRL-F and CTRL-B. (Garhi)
-   extend 'scrollbind' option: 'scrollopt' words "search", "relative", etc..
    Also 'e'xecute some commands (search, vertical movements) in all bound
    windows.
7   Add 'scrollbind' feature to make the offset of one window with the next
    one equal to the window height.  When editing one file in both windows it
    looks like each window displays a page of the buffer.
-   Allow scrolling by dragging with the mouse (grab a character and move it
    up/down).  Like the "hand" in Acrobat reader.  Use Alt-LeftMouse for this?
    (Goldfarb)
-   Add command to execute some commands (search, vertical movements) in all
    bound windows.
-   Add 'search' option to 'scrollopt' to allow 'scrollbind' windows to
    be bound by regexp searches
-   Add "z>" and "z<": scroll sideways one screenful. (Campbell)
-   Add option to set the number of lines when not to scroll, instead of the
    fixed number used now (for terminals that scroll slow with a large number
    of lines but not with a single line).


Autoconf:
8   Should use acconfig.h to define prototypes that are used by autoheader.
8   Some compilers don't give an error for "-OPT:Olimit" but a warning. (Webb)
    Add a check for the warning, so that "Olimit" can be added automatically?
-   Autoconf: Use @datadir@ for the system independent files.  Make sure the
    system dependent and system independent files are separated. (Leitner).
-   Add autoconf check for waitpid()/wait4().
-   Remove fcntl() from autoconf, all systems have it?
-   Set default for 'dictionary', add search for dictionary to autoconf.


Perl interface:
8   Rename typemap file to something else?
7   Make buffers accessed as Perl arrays. (Clark)
7   Make it possible to compile with non-ANSI C?
6   Tcl/Tk has the "load" command: load a shared library (.so or .dll).


Shared libraries:
6   Add support for loading shared libraries, and calling functions in it.
	:libload internal-name libname
	:libunload internal-name
	:liblist
	:libcall internal-name function(arg1, arg2, ...)
	:libcall function(arg1, arg2, ...)
    libcall() can have only one integer or String argument at the moment.
6   Have a look on how Perl handles loading dynamic libraries.


Tags:
9   With ":set tags=./tags,../tags" and a tag appears in both tags files it is
    added twice.  Requires figuring out the actual file name for each found
    match.  Remove tag_fname from the match and combine it with the fname in
    the match (without expanding or other things that take time).  When
    'tagrelative' is off tag_fname isn't needed at all.
8   For 'tags' wildcard in the file name is not supported, only in the path.
    This is due to it using |file-searching|. Suboptimal solution would be to
    make the filename or the whole option use |wildcards| globing, better
    would be to merge the 2 kinds of globing. originally (Erik Falor, 2008
    April 18), updated (Ian Kelling, 2008 July 4)
7   Can CTRL-] (jump to tag) include a following "." and "->" to restrict the
    number of possible matches? Check tags file for an item that has members.
    (Flemming Madsen)
8   Scope arguments for ":tag", e.g.: ":tag class:cPage open", like Elvis.
8   When output of ":tselect" is long, getting the more-prompt, should be able
    to type the tag number directly.
7   Add the possibility to use the "-t {tag}" argument multiple times.  Open a
    window for each tag.
7   Make output of ":tselect" a bit nicer.  Use highlighting?
7   Highlight the "tag 1 of >2" message.  New highlight group, or same as "hit
    bottom" search message.
7   When using ":tag" at the top of the tag stack, should add another entry,
    so CTRL-T can bring you back to where you are now AND to where you were
    before the previous ":tag" command. (Webb)
-   When doing "[^I" or "[^D" add position to tag stack.
-   Add command to put current position to tag stack: ":tpush".
-   Add functions to save and restore the tag stack?  Or a command to switch
    to another tag stack?  So that you can do something else and come back to
    what you were working on.
7   When using CTRL-] on someClass::someMethod, separate class from method and
    use ":ta class:someClass someMethod".
    Include C++ tags changes (Bertin).	Change "class::func" tag into "func"
    with "class=class"?  Docs in oldmail/bertin/in.xxx.
7   Add ":tagargs", to set values for fields:
	:tagargs class:someclass file:version.c
	:tagargs clear
    These are then the default values (changes the order of priority in tag
    matching).
7   Support for "gtags" and "global"?  With ":rtag" command?
    There is an example for how to do this in Nvi.
    Or do it like Elvis: 'tagprg' and 'tagprgonce' options. (Yamaguchi)
    The Elvis method is far more flexible, do it that way.
7   Support "col:99" extra field, to position the cursor in that column.  With
    a flag in 'cpoptions' to switch it off again.
7   Better support for jumping to where a function or variable is used.  Use
    the id-utils, with a connection to "gid" (Emacs can do it too).  Add
    ":idselect", which uses an "ID" database (made by "mkid") like "tselect".


Autocommands:
-   Put autocommand event names in a hashtable for faster lookup?
8   When the SwapExists event is triggered, provide information about the
    swap file, e.g., whether the process is running, file was modified, etc.
    Must be possible to check the situation that it's probably OK to delete
    the swap file. (Marc Merlin)
8   When all the patterns for an event are "*" there is no need to expand
    buffer names to a full path.  This can be slow for NFS.
7   For autocommand events that trigger multiple times per buffer (e.g.,
    CursorHold), go through the list once and cache the result for a specific
    buffer.  Invalidate the cache when adding/deleting autocommands or
    changing the buffer name.
7   Add TagJump event: do something after jumping to a tag.
8   Add "TagJumpFile" autocommand: When jumping to another file for a tag.
    Can be used to open "main.c.gz" when "main.c" isn't found.
8   Use another option than 'updatetime' for the CursorHold event.  The two
    things are unrelated for the user (but the implementation is more
    difficult).
7   Add autocommand event for when a buffer cannot be abandoned.  So that the
    user can define the action taking (autowrite, dialog, fail) based on the
    kind of file. (Yakov Lerner)  Or is BufLeave sufficient?
8   Autocommand for when modified files have been found, when getting input
    focus again (e.g., FileChangedFocus).
    Check when: getting focus, jumping to another buffer, ...
7   Autocommand for when an option is changed.  Match buffer name or option
    name?
8   Autocommands should not change registers.  And marks?  And the jumplist?
    And anything else?  Add a command to save and restore these things.
8   Add autocommands, user functions and user commands to ":mkvimrc".
6   Add KeymapChanged event, so that the effects of a different keymap can be
    handled (e.g., other font) (Ron Aaron)
7   When trying to open a directory, trigger an OpenDirectory event.
7   Add file type in front of file pattern: <d> for directory, <l> for link,
    <x> for executable, etc.  With commas to separate alternatives.  The
    autocommand is only executed when both the file type AND the file pattern
    match. (Leonard)
5   Add option that specifies extensions which are to be discarded from the
    file name.  E.g. 'ausuffix', with ".gz,.orig".  Such that file.c.gz will
    trigger the "*.c" autocommands.  (Belabas)
7   Add something to break the autocommands for the current event, and for
    what follows.  Useful for a "BufWritePre" that wants to avoid writing the
    file.
8   When editing "tt.gz", which is in DOS format, 'fileformat' stays at
    "unix", thus writing the file changes it.  Somehow detect that the read
    command used dos fileformat.  Same for 'fileencoding'.
-   Add events to autocommands:
    Error	    - When an error happens
    NormalEnter	    - Entering Normal mode
    ReplaceEnter    - Entering Replace mode
    CmdEnter	    - Entering Cmdline mode (with type of cmdline to allow
			different mapping)
    VisualEnter	    - Entering Visual mode
    *Leave	    - Leaving a mode (in pair with the above *Enter)
    VimLeaveCheck    - Before Vim decides to exit, so that it can be cancelled
		      when exiting isn't a good idea.
    CursorHoldC     - CursorHold while command-line editing
    WinMoved	    - when windows have been moved around, e.g, ":wincmd J"
    SearchPost	    - After doing a search command (e.g. to do "M")
    PreDirChanged/PostDirChanged
		    - Before/after ":cd" has been used (for changing the
		      window title)
    ShutDown	    - when the system is about to shut down
    InsertCharPost  - user typed a character in Insert mode, after inserting
		      the char.
    BufModified	    - When a buffer becomes modified, or unmodified (for
		      putting a [+] in the window title or checking out the
		      file from CVS).
    BufFirstChange  - When making a change, when 'modified' is set.  Can be
		      used to do a :preserve for remote files.
    BufChange	    - after a change was made.  Set some variables to indicate
		      the position and number of inserted/deleted lines, so
		      that marks can be updated.  HierAssist has patch to add
		      BufChangePre, BufChangePost and RevertBuf. (Shah)
    ViewChanged	    - triggered when the text scrolls and when the window size
		      changes.
    WinResized	    - After a window has been resized
    WinClose	    - Just before closing a window
-   Write the file now and then ('autosave'):
				  *'autosave'* *'as'* *'noautosave'* *'noas'*
    'autosave' 'as' number  (default 0)
	    Automatically write the current buffer to file N seconds after the
	    last change has been made and when |'modified'| is still set.
	    Default: 0 = do not autosave the buffer.
    Alternative: have 'autosave' use 'updatetime' and 'updatecount' but make
    them save the file itself besides the swapfile.


Omni completion:
-   Add a flag to 'complete' to be able to do omni completion with CTRL-N (and
    mix it with other kinds of completion).
-   Ideas from the Vim 7 BOF at SANE:
	- For interpreted languages, use the interpreter to obtain information.
	  Should work for Java (Eclipse does this), Python, Tcl, etc.
	  Richard Emberson mentioned working on an interface to Java.
	- Check Readline for its completion interface.
-   Ideas from others:

	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=747
	    http://sourceforge.net/projects/insenvim
		or http://insenvim.sourceforge.net
	    Java, XML, HTML, C++, JSP, SQL, C#
	    MS-Windows only, lots of dependencies (e.g. Perl, Internet
		explorer), uses .dll shared libraries.
	    For C++ uses $INCLUDE environment var.
	    Uses Perl for C++.
	    Uses ctags to find the info:

-   Pre-expand abbreviations, show which abbrevs would match?


Insert mode completion/expansion:
7   When searching in other files the name flash by, too fast to read.  Only
    display a name every second or so, like with ":vimgrep".
7   When expanding file names with an environment variable, add the match with
    the unexpanded var.  So $HOME/tm expands to "/home/guy/tmp" and
    "$HOME/tmp"
8   When there is no word before the cursor but something like "sys." complete
    with "sys.".  Works well for C and similar languages.
9   ^X^L completion doesn't repeat correctly.  It uses the first match with
    the last added line, instead of continuing where the last match ended.
    (Webb)
8   Add option to set different behavior for Insert mode completion:
    - ignore/match case
    - different characters than 'iskeyword'
8   Add option 'isexpand', containing characters when doing expansion (so that
    "." and "\" can be included, without changing 'iskeyword'). (Goldfarb)
    Also: 'istagword': characters used for CTRL-].
    When 'isexpand' or 'istagword' are empty, use 'iskeyword'.
    Alternative: Use a pattern so that start and end of a keyword can be
    defined, only allow dash in the middle, etc.
8   Add a command to undo the completion, go back to the original text.
7   Completion of an abbreviation: Can leave letters out, like what Instant
    text does: www.textware.com
8   Use the class information in the tags file to do context-sensitive
    completion.  After "foo." complete all member functions/variables of
    "foo".  Need to search backwards for the class definition of foo.
    Should work for C++ and Java.
    Even more context would be nice: "import java.^N" -> "io", "lang", etc.
7   When expanding $HOME/dir with ^X^F keep the $HOME (with an option?).
7   Add CTRL-X command in Insert mode like CTRL-X CTRL-N, that completes WORDS
    instead of words.
8   Add CTRL-X CTRL-R: complete words from register contents.
8   Add completion of previously inserted texts (like what CTRL-A does).
    Requires remembering a number of insertions.
8   Add 'f' flag to 'complete': Expand file names.
    Also apply 'complete' to whole line completion.
-   Add a flag to 'complete' to only scan local header files, not system
    header files. (Andri Moell)
-   Make it possible to search include files in several places.  Use the
    'path' option?  Can this be done with the dictionary completion (use
    wildcards in the file name)?
-   Make CTRL-X CTRL-K do a binary search in the dictionary (if it's sorted).
-   Speed up CTRL-X CTRL-K dictionary searching (don't use a regexp?).
-   Set a mark at the position where the match was found (file mark, could
    be in another file).
-   Add CTRL-A command in CTRL-X mode: show all matches.
-   Make CTRL-X CTRL-L use the 'complete' option?
-   Add command in CTRL-X mode to add following words to the completed string
    (e.g. to complete "Pointer->element" with CTRL-X CTRL-P CTRL-W CTRL-W)
-   CTRL-X CTRL-F: Use 'path' to find completions.
-   CTRL-X CTRL-F: Option to use forward slashes on MS-Windows?
-   CTRL-X CTRL-F: Don't replace "$VIM" with the actual value. (Kelly)
-   Allow listing all matches in some way (and picking one from the list).


Command line editing:
7   Add commands (keys) to delete from the cursor to the end of the command
    line.
8   Custom completion of user commands can't use the standard completion
    functions.  Add a hook to invoke a user function that returns the type of
    completion to be done: "file", "tag", "custom", etc.
-   Add flags to 'whichwrap' for command line editing (cursor right at end of
    lines wraps to start of line).
-   Make editing the command line work like Insert mode in a single-line view
    on a buffer that contains the command line history.  But this has many
    disadvantages, only implement it when these can be solved.  Elvis has run
    into these, see remarks from Steve (~/Mail/oldmail/kirkendall/in.00012).
    - Going back in history and editing a line there would change the history.
      Would still need to keep a copy of the history elsewhere.  Like the
      cmdwin does now already.
    - Use CTRL-O to execute one Normal mode command.  How to switch to normal
      mode for more commands?  <Esc> should cancel the command line.  CTRL-T?
    - To allow "/" and "= need to recursively call getcmdline(), overwrite the
      cmdline.  But then we are editing a command-line again.  How to avoid
      that the user gets confused by the stack of command lines?
    - Use edit() for normal cmdline editing?  Would have to integrate
      getcmdline() into edit().  Need to solve conflicts between Insert mode
      and Command-line mode commands.  Make it work like Korn shell and tcsh.
      Problems:
	- Insert: completion with 'wildchar'
	- Insert: use cmdline abbreviations
	- Insert: CTRL-D deletes indent instead of listing matches
	- Normal: no CTRL-W commands
	- Normal: no ":" commands?
	- Normal: allow Visual mode only within one line.
    - where to show insert/normal mode message?  Change highlighting of
      character in first column?
    - Implementation ideas:
      - Set "curwin" and "curbuf" to the command line window and buffer.
      - curwin->w_topline is always equal to curwin->w_cursor.lnum.
      - never set 'number', no folding, etc.  No status line.
      - sync undo after entering a command line?
      - use NV_NOCL flag for commands that are not allowed in Command-line
	Mode.


Command line completion:
8   Change expand_interactively into a flag that is passed as an argument.
8   With command line completion after '%' and '#', expand current/alternate
    file name, so it can be edited.  Also with modifiers, such as "%:h".
8   When completing command names, either sort them on the long name, or list
    them with the optional part inside [].
8   Add an option to ignore case when doing interactive completion.  So that
    ":e file<Tab>" also lists "Filelist" (sorted after matching case matches).
7   Completion of ":map x ": fill in the current mapping, so that it can be
    edited. (Sven Guckes)
-   For 'wildmenu': Simplify "../bar" when possible.
-   When using <Up> in wildmenu mode for a submenu, should go back to the
    current menu, not the first one.  E.g., ":emenu File.Save<Up>".
8   When using backtick expansion, the external command may write a greeting
    message.  Add an option or commands to remove lines that match a regexp?
7   When listing matches of files, display the common path separately from the
    file names, if this makes the listing shorter. (Webb)
-   Add command line completion for ":ilist" and friends, show matching
    identifiers (Webb).
8   Add command line completion for "old value" of a command.  ":args <key>"
    would result in the current list of arguments, which you can then edit.
7   Add command line completion with CTRL-X, just like Insert mode completion.
    Useful for ":s/word/xx/".
-   Add command to go back to the text as it was before completion started.
    Also to be used for <Up> in the command line.
-   Add 'wildlongest' option: Key to use to find longest common match for
    command line completion (default CTRL-L), like 'wildchar'. (Cregut)
    Also: when there are several matches, show them line a CTRL-D.


Command line history:
-   Add "KeyWasTyped" flag: It's reset before each command and set when a
    character from the keyboard is consumed. Value is used to decide to put a
    command line in history or not. Put line in history if it didn't
    completely resulted from one mapping.
-   When using ":browse", also put the resulting edit command in the history,
    so that it can be repeated. (Demirel)


Insert mode:
9   When 'autoindent' is set, hitting <CR> twice, while there is text after
    the cursor, doesn't delete the autoindent in the resulting blank line.
    (Rich Wales) This is Vi compatible, but it looks like a bug.
8   When using CTRL-O in Insert mode, then executing an insert command
    "a" or "i", should we return to Insert mode after <Esc>? (Eggink)
    Perhaps it can be allowed a single time, to be able to do
    "<C-O>10axyz<Esc>".  Nesting this further is confusing.
    ":map <F2> 5aabc<Esc>" works only once from Insert mode.
8   When using CTRL-G CTRL-O do like CTRL-\ CTRL-O, but when returning with
    the cursor in the same position and the text didn't change continue the
    same change, so that "." repeats the whole insert.
7   Use CTRL-G <count> to repeat what follows.  Useful for inserting a
    character multiple times or repeating CTRL-Y.
-   Make 'revins' work in Replace mode.
9   Can't use multi-byte characters for 'matchpairs'.
7   Use 'matchpairs' for 'showmatch': When inserting a character check if it
    appears in the rhs of 'matchpairs'.
-   In Insert mode (and command line editing?): Allow undo of the last typed
    character.	This is useful for CTRL-U, CTRL-W, delete and backspace, and
    also for characters that wrap to the next line.
    Also: be able to undo CTRL-R (insert register).
    Possibly use 'backspace'="whole" for a mode where at least a <CR> that
    inserts autoindent is undone by a single <BS>.
-   Use CTRL-G in Insert mode for an extra range of commands, like "g" in
    Normal mode.
-   Make 'paste' work without resetting other options, but override their
    value.  Avoids problems when changing files and modelines or autocommands
    are used.
-   When typing CTRL-V and a digit higher than 2, only expect two digits.
-   Insert binary numbers with CTRL-V b.
-   Make it possible to undo <BS>, <C-W> and <C-U>.  Bash uses CTRL-Y.


'cindent', 'smartindent':
9   Wrapping a variable initialization should have extra indent:
	char * veryLongName =
		"very long string"
    Also check if "cino=+10" is used correctly.
8   Lisp indenting: "\\" confuses the indenter. (Dorai Sitaram, 2006 May 17)
8   Why are continuation lines outside of a {} block not indented?  E.g.:
	long_type foo =
	value;
8   Java: Inside an anonymous class, after an "else" or "try" the indent is
    too small. (Vincent Bergbauer)
    Problem of using {} inside (), 'cindent' doesn't work then.
8   In C++ it's possible to have {} inside (): (Kirshna)
		func(
			new String[] {
			    "asdf",
			    "asdf"
			}
		    );
8   In C++ a function isn't recognized inside a namespace:
    (Chow Loong Jin)
	namespace {
	    int
		 func(int arg) {
		 }
	}
6   Add 'cino' flag for this function argument layout: (Spencer Collyer)
	    func( arg1
	        , arg2
		, arg3
		);
7   Add separate "(0" option into inside/outside a function (Zellner):
	func(
	   int x)	// indent like "(4"
	{
	   if (a
	       && b)	// indent like "(0"
9   Using "{" in a comment: (Helmut Stiegler)
    if (a)
    {
	    if (b)
	    {
		    // {
	    }
	    } <-- this is indented incorrect
    Problem is that find_start_brace() checks for the matching brace to be in
    a comment, but not braces in between.  Requires adding a comment check to
    findmatchlimit().
-   Make smartindenting configurable.  Add 'sioptions', e.g. '#' setting the
    indent to 0 should be switched on/off.
7   Support ANSI style function header, with each argument on its own line.
-   "[p" and "]p" should use 'cindent' code if it's on (only for the first
    line).
-   Add option to 'cindent' to set indent for comments outside of {}?
-   Make a command to line up a comment after a code line with a previous
    comment after a code line.	Can 'cindent' do this automatically?
-   When 'cindent'ing a '}', showmatch is done before fixing the indent.  It
    looks better when the indent is fixed before the showmatch. (Webb)
-   Add option to make indenting work in comments too (for commented-out
    code), unless the line starts with "*".
-   Don't use 'cindent' when doing formatting with "gq"?
-   When formatting a comment after some text, insert the '*' for the new line
    (indent is correct if 'cindent' is set, but '*' doesn't get inserted).
8   When 'comments' has both "s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/" and "s1:(*,mb:*,ex:*)", the
    'x' flag always uses the first match.  Need to continue looking for more
    matches of "*" and remember all characters that could end the comment.
-   For smartindent: When typing 'else' line it up with matching 'if'.
-   'smartindent': allow patterns in 'cinwords', for e.g. TeX files, where
    lines start with "\item".
-   Support this style of comments (with an option): (Brown)
	/* here is a comment that
	is just autoindented, and
	nothing else */
-   Add words to 'cinwords' to reduce the indent, e.g., "end" or "fi".
7   Use Tabs for the indent of starting lines, pad with spaces for
    continuation lines.  Allows changing 'tabstop' without messing up the
    indents.
    Patch by Lech Lorens, 2010 Mar.  Update by James McCoy, 2014 Mar 15.


Java:
8   Can have {} constructs inside parens.  Include changes from Steve
    Odendahl?
8   Recognize "import java.util.Vector" and use $CLASSPATH to find files for
    "[i" commands and friends.
-   For files found with 'include': handle "*" in included name, for Java.
    (Jason)
-   How to make a "package java.util" cause all classes in the package to be
    searched?  Also for "import java.util.*". (Mark Brophy)


'comments':
8   When formatting C comments that are after code, the "*" isn't repeated
    like it's done when there is no code.  And there is no automatic wrapping.
    Recognize comments that come after code.  Should insert the comment leader
    when it's "#" or "//".
    Other way around: when a C command starts with "* 4" the "*" is repeated
    while it should not.  Use syntax HL comment recognition?
7   When using "comments=fg:--", Vim inserts three spaces for a new line.
    When hitting a TAB, these spaces could be removed.
7   The 'n'esting flag doesn't do the indenting of the last (rightmost) item.
6   Make strings in 'comments' option a RE, to be able to match more
    complicated things. (Phillipps)  Use a special flag to indicate that a
    regexp is used.
8   Make the 'comments' option with "/* * */" lines only repeat the "*" line
    when there is a "/*" before it?  Or include this in 'cindent'?


Virtual edit:
8   Make the horizontal scrollbar work to move the text further left.
7   Allow specifying it separately for Tabs and beyond end-of-line?


Text objects:
8   Add text object for fold, so that it can be yanked when it's open.
8   Add test script for text object commands "aw", "iW", etc.
8   Add text object for part of a CamelHumpedWord and under_scored_word.
    (Scott Graham)  "ac" and "au"?
8   Add a text object for any kind of quoting, also with multi-byte
    characters.  Option to specify what quotes are recognized (default: all)
    use "aq" and "iq".  Use 'quotepairs' to define pairs of quotes, like
    'matchpairs'?
8   Add text object for any kind of parens, also multi-byte ones.
7   Add text object for current search pattern: "a/" and "i/".  Makes it
    possible to turn text highlighted for 'hlsearch' into a Visual area.
8   Add a way to make an ":omap" for a user-defined text object.  Requires
    changing the starting position in oap->start.
8   Add "gp" and "gP" commands: insert text and make sure there is a single
    space before it, unless at the start of the line, and after it, unless at
    the end of the line or before a ".".
7   Add objects with backwards extension?  Use "I" and "A".  Thus "2dAs"
    deletes the current and previous sentence. (Jens Paulus)
7   Add "g{" and "g}" to move to the first/last character of a paragraph
    (instead of the line just before/after a paragraph as with "{" and "}").
6   Ignore comment leaders for objects.  Make "das" work in reply-email.
5   Make it possible to use syntax group matches as a text object.  For
    example, define a "ccItem" group, then do "da<ccItem>" to delete one.
    Or, maybe just define "dai", delete-an-item, to delete the syntax item the
    cursor is on.


Select mode:
8   In blockwise mode, typed characters are inserted in front of the block,
    backspace deletes a column before the block. (Steve Hall)
7   Alt-leftmouse starts block mode selection in MS Word.
    See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_Alt-Mouse_to_select_blockwise.
7   Add Cmdline-select mode.  Like Select mode, but used on the command line.
    - Change gui_send_mouse_event() to pass on mouse events when 'mouse'
      contains 'C' or 'A'.
    - Catch mouse events in ex_getln.c.  Also shift-cursor, etc., like in
      normal_cmd().
    - remember start and end of selection in cmdline_info.
    - Typing text replaces the selection.


Visual mode:
8   Support using "." in Visual mode. Use the operator applied to the Visual
    selection, if possible.
-   When dragging the Visual selection with the mouse and 'scrolloff' is zero,
    behave like 'scrolloff' is one, so that the text scrolls when the pointer
    is in the top line.
-   Displaying size of Visual area: use 24-33 column display.
    When selecting multiple lines, up to about a screenful, also count the
    characters.
8   When using "I" or "A" in Visual block mode, short lines do not get the new
    text.  Make it possible to add the text to short lines too, with padding
    where needed.
7   With a Visual block selected, "2x" deletes a block of double the width,
    "3y" yanks a block of triple width, etc.
7   When selecting linewise, using "itext" should insert "text" at the start
    of each selected line.
8   What is "R" supposed to do in Visual mode?
8   Make Visual mode local to the buffer.  Allow changing to another buffer.
    When starting a new Visual selection, remove the Visual selection in any
    other buffer. (Ron Aaron)
8   Support dragging the Visual area to drop it somewhere else. (Ron Aaron,
    Ben Godfrey)
7   Support dragging the Visual area to drop it in another program, and
    receive dropped text from another program. (Ben Godfrey)
7   With blockwise Visual mode and "c", "C", "I", "A", etc., allow the use of
    a <CR>.  The entered lines are repeated over the Visual area.
7   CTRL-V :s should substitute only in the block, not to whole lines. (David
    Young is working on this)
7   Filtering a block should only apply to the block, not to the whole lines.
    When the number of lines is increased, add lines. When decreased, pad with
    spaces or delete? Use ":`<,`>" on the command line.
8   After filtering the Visual area, make "gv" select the filtered text?
    Currently "gv" only selects a single line, not useful.
7   Don't move the cursor when scrolling?  Needed when the selection should
    stay the same.  Scroll to the cursor at any movement command.  With an
    option!
7   In Visual block mode, need to be able to define a corner on a position
    that doesn't have text?  Also: when using the mouse, be able to select
    part of a TAB.  Even more: Add a mode where the cursor can be on a screen
    position where there is no text.  When typing, add spaces to fill the gap.
    Other solution: Always use curswant, so that you can move the cursor to
    the right column, and then use up/down movements to select the line,
    without changing the column.
6   ":left" and ":right" should work in Visual block mode.
7   CTRL-I and CTRL-O should work in Visual mode, but only jump to marks in the
    current buffer.
7   CTRL-A and CTRL-X should increase/decrease all numbers in the Visual area.
6   In non-Block mode, "I" should insert the same text in front of each line,
    before the first non-blank, "gI" in column 1.
6   In non-Block mode, "A" should append the same text after each line.
6   When in blockwise visual selection (CTRL-V), allow cursor to be placed
    right of the line.  Could also allow cursor to be placed anywhere on a TAB
    or other special character.
6   Add commands to move selected text, without deselecting.


More advanced repeating commands:
-   Add "." command for visual mode: redo last visual command (e.g. ":fmt").
7   Repeating "d:{cmd}" with "." doesn't work. (Benji Fisher)  Somehow remember
    the command line so that it can be repeated?
-   Add command to repeat last movement.  Including count.
-   Add "." command after operator: repeat last command of same operator.  E.g.
    "c." will repeat last change, also when "x" used since then (Webb).
    "y." will repeat last yank.
    "c2." will repeat the last but one change?
    Also: keep history of Normal mode commands, add command to list the history
    and/or pick an older command.
-   History stack for . command?  Use "g." command.


Mappings and Abbreviations:
8   When "0" is mapped (it is a movement command) this mapping should not be
    used after typing another number, e.g. "20l". (Charles Campbell)
    Is this possible without disabling the mapping of the following command?
8   Should mapping <C-A> and <C-S-A> both work?
7   ":abbr b byte", append "b " to an existing word still expands to "byte".
    This is Vi compatible, but can we avoid it anyway?
8   To make a mapping work with a prepended "x to select a register, store the
    last _typed_ register name and access it with "&.
8   Add ":amap", like ":amenu".
7   Add a mapping that works always, for remapping the keyboard.
8   Add ":cab!", abbreviations that only apply to Command-line mode and not to
    entering search strings.
8   Add a flag to ":abbrev" to eat the character that triggers the
    abbreviation.  Thus "abb ab xxx" and typing "ab<Space>" inserts "xxx" and
    not the <Space>.
8   Give a warning when using CTRL-C in the lhs of a mapping.  It will never
    (?) work.
8   Add a way to save a current mapping and restore it later.  Use a function
    that returns the mapping command to restore it: mapcmd()?  mapcheck() is
    not fool proof.  How to handle ambiguous mappings?
7   Add <0x8f> (hex), <033> (octal) and <123> (decimal) to <> notation?
7   When someone tries to unmap with a trailing space, and it fails, try
    unmapping without the trailing space.  Helps for ":unmap xx | unmap yy".
6   Context-sensitive abbreviations: Specify syntax group(s) in which the
    abbreviations are to be used.
-   Add mappings that take arguments.  Could work like the ":s" command.  For
    example, for a mouse escape sequence:
	:mapexp  <Esc>{\([0-9]*\),\([0-9]*\);	H\1j\2l
-   Add optional <Number> argument for mappings:
    :map <Number>q	     ^W^W<Number>G
    :map <Number>q<Number>t  ^W^W<Number1-1>G<Number2>l
    :map q<Char>	    :s/<Char>/\u\0/g
    Or implicit:
    :map q			<Register>d<Number>$
-   Add command to repeat a whole mapping ("." only repeats the last change in
    a mapping).  Also: Repeat a whole insert command, including any mappings
    that it included.  Sort-of automatic recording?
-   Include an option (or flag to 'cpoptions') that makes errors in mappings
    not flush the rest of the mapping (like nvi does).
-   Use context sensitiveness of completion to switch abbreviations and
    mappings off for :unab and :unmap.
6   When using mappings in Insert mode, insert characters for incomplete
    mappings first, then remove them again when a mapping matches.  Avoids
    that characters that are the start of some mapping are not shown until you
    hit another character.
-   Add mappings for replace mode: ":rmap".  How do we then enter mappings for
    non-replace Insert mode?
-   Add separate mappings for Visual-character/block/line mode?
-   Add 'mapstop' command, to stop recursive mappings.
-   List mappings that have a raw escape sequence both with the name of the key
    for that escape sequence (if there is one) and the sequence itself.
-   List mappings: Once with special keys listed as <>, once with meta chars as
    <M-a>, once with the byte values (octal?).  Sort of "spell mapping" command?
-   When entering mappings: Add the possibility to enter meta keys like they
    are displayed, within <>: <M-a>, <~@> or <|a>.
-   Allow multiple arguments to :unmap.
-   Command to show keys that are not used and available for mapping
    ":freekeys".
-   Allow any character except white space in abbreviations lhs (Riehm).


Incsearch:
-   Add a limit to the number of lines that are searched for 'incsearch'?
-   When no match is found and the user types more, the screen is redrawn
    anyway.  Could skip that.  Esp. if the line wraps and the text is scrolled
    up every time.
-   Temporarily open folds to show where the search ends up.  Restore the
    folds when going to another line.
-   When incsearch used and hitting return, no need to search again in many
    cases, saves a lot of time in big files. (Slootman wants to work on this?)
    When not using special characters, can continue search from the last match
    (or not at all, when there was no match).  See oldmail/webb/in.872.
-   With incsearch, use CTRL-N/CTRL-P to go to next/previous match, some other
    key to copy matched word to search pattern (Alexander Schmid).


Searching:
9   Should have an option for :vimgrep to find lines without a match.
8   Add "g/" and "gb" to search for a pattern in the Visually selected text?
    "g?" is already used for rot13.
    The vis.vim script has a ":S" command that does something like this.
    Can use "g/" in Normal mode, uses the '< to '> area.
    Use "&/" for searching the text in the Visual area?
9   Add "v" offset: "/pat/v": search for pattern and start Visual mode on the
    matching text.
8   Add a modifier to interpret a space like "\_s\+" to make it much easier to
    search for a phrase.
8   Add a mechanism for recursiveness: "\@(([^()]*\@g[^()]*)\)".  \@g stands
    for "go recursive here" and \@( \) marks the recursive part.
    Perl does it this way:
	    $paren = qr/ \(( [^()] | (??{ $paren }) )* \) /x;
    Here $paren is evaluated when it's encountered.  This is like a regexp
    inside a regexp.  In the above terms it would be:
	    \@((\([^()]\|\@g\)*)\)
8   Show the progress every second.  Could use the code that checks for CTRL-C
    to find out how much time has passed.  Or use SIGALRM.  Where to show the
    number?
8   When using an expression for ":s", set the match position in a v:
    variable.  So that you can do ":%s/^/\=v:lnum/" to put a line number
    before each line.
7   Support for approximate-regexps to find similar words (agrep
    http://www.tgries.de/agrep/ tre: http://laurikari.net/tre/index.html).
8   Add an item for a big character range, so that one can search for a
    chinese character: \z[234-1234]  or \z[XX-YY] or \z[0x23-0x234].
7   Add an item stack to allow matching ().  One side is "push X on
    the stack if previous atom matched".  Other side is "match with top of
    stack, pop it when it matches".  Use "\@pX" and "\@m"?
	Example: \((\@p).\{-}\@m\)*
7   Add an option to accept a match at the cursor position.  Also for
    search(). (Brett)
7   Add a flag to "/pat/" to discard an error.  Useful to continue a mapping
    when a search fails.  Could be "/pat/E" (e is already used for end offset).
7   Add pattern item to use properties of Unicode characters.  In Perl it's
    "\p{L}" for a letter.  See Regular Expression Pocket Reference.
8   Would it be possible to allow ":23,45/pat/flags" to search for "pat" in
    lines 23 to 45?  Or does this conflict with Ex range syntax?
8   Allow identical pairs in 'matchpairs'.  Restrict the search to the current
    line.
7   Allow longer pairs in 'matchpairs'.  Use ~/vim/macros/matchit.vim as an
    example.
8   Make it possible to define the character that "%" checks for in
    #if/#endif.  For nmake it's !if/!endif.
-   For "%" command: set hierarchy for which things include other things that
    should be ignored (like "*/" or "#endif" inside /* */).
    Also: use "%" to jump from start to end of syntax region and back.
    Alternative: use matchit.vim
8   "/:/e+1" gets stuck on a match at the end of the line.  Do we care?
8   A pattern like "\([^a]\+\)\+" takes an awful long time.  Recognize that
    the recursive "\+" is meaningless and optimize for it.
    This one is also very slow on "/* some comment */": "^\/\*\(.*[^/]\)*$".
7   Recognize "[a-z]", "[0-9]", etc. and replace them with the faster "\l" and
    "\d".
7   Add a way to specify characters in <C-M> or <Key> form.  Could be
    \%<C-M>.
8   Add an argument after ":s/pat/str/" for a range of matches.  For example,
    ":s/pat/str/#3-4" to replace only the third and fourth "pat" in a line.
8   When 'iskeyword' is changed the matches from 'hlsearch' may change. (Benji
    Fisher)  redraw if some options are set while 'hlsearch' is set?
8   Add an option not to use 'hlsearch' highlighting for ":s" and ":g"
    commands. (Kahn)  It would work like ":noh" is used after that command.
    Also: An extra flag to do this once, and a flag to keep the existing
    search pattern.
-   Make 'hlsearch' a local/global option, so that it can be disabled in some
    of the windows.
-   Add \%h{group-name}; to search for a specific highlight group.
    Add \%s{syntax-group}; to search for a specific syntax group.
-   Support Perl regexp.  Use PCRE (Perl Compatible RE) package. (Shade)
    Or translate the pattern to a Vim one.
    Don't switch on with an option for typed commands/mappings/functions, it's
    too confusing.  Use "\@@" in the pattern, to avoid incompatibilities.
8   Add a way to access the last substitute text, what is used for ":s//~/".
    Can't use the ~ register, it's already used for drag & drop.
-   Remember flags for backreferenced items, so that "*" can be used after it.
    Check with "\(\S\)\1\{3}". (Hemmerling)
8   Flags that apply to the whole pattern.
    This works for all places where a regexp is used.
    Add "\q" to not store this pattern as the last search pattern?
-   Add flags to search command (also for ":s"?):
    i	ignore case
    I	use case
    p	use Perl regexp syntax (or POSIX?)
    v	use Vi regexp syntax
    f	forget pattern, don't keep it for "n" command
    F   remember pattern, keep it for "n" command
    Perl uses these too:
    e	evaluate the right side as an expression (Perl only)
    m	multiple line expression (we don't need it)
    o	compile only once (Perl only)
    s	single line expression (we don't need it)
    x	extended regexp (we don't need it)
    When used after ":g" command, backslash needed to avoid confusion with the
    following command.
    Add 'searchflags' for default flags (replaces 'gdefault').
-   Add command to display the last used substitute pattern and last used
    pattern. (Margo)  Maybe make it accessible through a register (like "/
    for search string)?
7   Use T-search algorithm, to speed up searching for strings without special
    characters.  See C't article, August 1997.
-   Add 'fuzzycase' option, so that case doesn't matter, and '-' and '_' are
    equivalent (for Unix filenames).
-   Add 'v' flag to search command: enter Visual mode, with the matching text
    as Visual area. (variation on idea from Bertin)
-   Searching: "/this//that/" should find "that" after "this".
-   Add global search commands: Instead of wrapping at the end of the buffer,
    they continue in another buffer.  Use flag after search pattern:
    a	for the next file in the argument list
    f	for file in the buffer list
    w	for file edited in a window.
    e.g. "/pat/f".  Then "n" and "N" work through files too.  "f" flag also for
    ":s/pat/foo/f"???  Then when 'autowrite' and 'hidden' are both not set, ask
    before saving files: "Save modified buffer "/path/file"? (Yes/Hide/No
    Save-all/hide-All/Quit) ".
-   ":s/pat/foo/3": find 3rd match of "pat", like sed. (Thomas Koehler)
7   When searching with 'n' give message when getting back where the search
    first started.  Remember start of search in '/ mark.
7   Add option that scrolls screen to put cursor in middle of screen after
    search always/when off-screen/never.  And after a ":tag" command.  Maybe
    specify how many lines below the screen causes a redraw with the cursor in
    the middle (default would be half a screen, zero means always).
6   Support multiple search buffers, so macros can be made without side
    effects.
7   From xvim: Allow a newline in search patterns (also for :s, can delete
    newline).  Add BOW, EOW, NEWL, NLORANY, NLBUTANY, magic 'n' and 'r', etc.
    [not in xvim:] Add option to switch on matches crossing ONE line boundary.
7   Add ":iselect", a combination of ":ilist" and ":tselect". (Aaron) (Zellner)
    Also ":dselect".


Undo:
9   ":gundo" command: global undo.  Undoes changes spread over multiple files
    in the order they were made.  Also ":gredo".  Both with a count.  Useful
    when tests fail after making changes and you forgot in which files.
9   After undo/redo, in the message show whether the buffer is modified or
    not.
8   Use timestamps for undo, so that a version a certain time ago can be found
    and info before some time/date can be flushed. 'undopersist' gives maximum
    time to keep undo: "3h", "1d", "2w", "1y", etc.
8   Search for pattern in undo tree, showing when it happened and the text
    state, so that you can jump to it.
8   Undo tree: visually show the tree somehow (Damian Conway)
    Show only the leaves, indicating how many changed from the branch and the
    timestamp?
    Put branch with most recent change on the left, older changes get more
    indent?
8   See ":e" as a change operation, find the changes and add them to the
    undo info.  Also be able to undo the "Reload file" choice for when a file
    was changed outside of Vim.
    Would require doing a diff between the buffer text and the file and
    storing the differences.
    Alternative: before reloading a buffer, store it somewhere.  Keep a list
    of about 10 last reloaded buffers.
-   Make it possible to undo all the commands from a mapping, including a
    trailing unfinished command, e.g. for ":map K iX^[r".
-   When accidentally hitting "R" instead of Ctrl-R, further Ctrl-R is not
    possible, even when typing <Esc> immediately. (Grahn)  Also for "i", "a",
    etc.  Postpone saving for undo until something is really inserted?
8   When Inserting a lot of text, it can only be undone as a whole.  Make undo
    sync points at every line or word.  Could recognize the start of a new
    word (white space and then non-white space) and backspacing.
    Can already use CTRL-G u, but that requires remapping a lot of things.
8   Make undo more memory-efficient: Compare text before and after change,
    only remember the lines that really changed.
7   Add undo for a range of lines.  Can change these back to a previous
    version without changing the rest of the file.  Stop doing this when a
    change includes only some of these lines and changes the line count.  Need
    to store these undo actions as a separate change that can be undone.
-   For u_save() include the column number. This can be used to set '[ and '].
    And in the future the undo can be made more efficient (Webb).
-   In out-of-memory situations: Free allocated space in undo, and reduce the
    number of undo levels (with confirmation).
-   Instead of [+], give the number of changes since the last write: [+123].
    When undoing to before the last write, change this to a negative number:
    [-99].
-   With undo with simple line delete/insert: optimize screen updating.
-   When executing macro's: Save each line for undo only once.
-   When doing a global substitute, causing almost all lines to be changed,
    undo info becomes very big.  Put undo info in swap file??


Buffer list:
7   Command to execute a command in another buffer: ":inbuf {bufname} {cmd}".
    Also for other windows: ":inwin {winnr} {cmd}".  How to make sure that
    this works properly for all commands, and still be able to return to the
    current buffer/window?  E.g.: ":inbuf xxx only".
8   Add File.{recent_files} menu entries: Recently edited files.
    Ron Aaron has a plugin for this: mru.vim.
8   Unix: Check all uses of fnamecmp() and fnamencmp() if they should check
    inode too.
7   Add another number for a buffer, which is visible for the user.  When
    creating a new buffer, use the lowest number not in use (or the highest
    number in use plus one?).
7   Offer some buffer selection from the command line?  Like using ":ls" and
    asking for a buffer number. (Zachmann)
-   When starting to edit a file that is already in the buffer list, use the
    file name argument for the new short file name. (Webb)
-   Add an option to make ":bnext" and ":bprev" wrap around the end of the
    buffer list.  Also for ":next" and ":prev"?
7   Add argument to ":ls" which is a pattern for buffers to list.
    E.g. ":ls *.c". (Thompson)
7   Add expansion of buffer names, so that "*.c" is expanded to all buffer
    names.  Needed for ":bdel *.c", ":bunload *.c", etc.
8   Support for <afile> where a buffer name is expected.
8   Some commands don't use line numbers, but buffer numbers.  '$'
    should then mean the number of the last buffer.  E.g.: "4,$bdel".
7   Add an option to mostly use slashes in file names.  Separately for
    internal use and for when executing an external program?
8   Some file systems are case-sensitive, some are not.  Besides
    'wildignorecase' there might be more parts inside
    CASE_INSENSITIVE_FILENAME that are useful on Unix.


Swap (.swp) files:
8   If writing to the swap file fails, should try to open one in another
    directory from 'dir'.  Useful in case the file system is full and when
    there are short file name problems.
8   Also use the code to try using a short file name for the backup and swap
    file for the Win32 and Dos 32 bit versions.
8   When a file is edited by root, add $LOGNAME to know who did su.
8   When the edited file is a symlink, try to put the swap file in the same
    dir as the actual file.  Adjust FullName().  Avoids editing the same file
    twice (e.g. when using quickfix).  Also try to make the name of the backup
    file the same as the actual file?
    Use the code for resolve()?
7   When using 64 bit inode numbers, also store the top 32 bits.  Add another
    field for this, using part of bo_fname[], to keep it compatible.
7   When editing a file on removable media, should put swap file somewhere
    else.  Use something like 'r' flag in 'viminfo'.  'diravoid'?
    Also: Be able to specify minimum disk space, skip directory when not
    enough room.
7   Add a configure check for which directory should be used: /tmp, /var/tmp
    or /var/preserve.
-   Add an option to create a swap file only when making the first change to
    the buffer.  (Liang)  Or only when the buffer is not read-only.
-   Add option to set "umask" for backup files and swap files (Antwerpen).
    'backupumask' and 'swapumask'?  Or 'umaskback' and 'umaskswap'?
-   When editing a readonly file, don't use a swap file but read parts from the
    original file.  Also do this when the file is huge (>'maxmem').  We do
    need to load the file once to count the number of lines?  Perhaps keep a
    cached list of which line is where.


Viminfo:
7   Can probably remove the code that checks for a writable viminfo file,
    because we now do the chown() for root, and others can't overwrite someone
    else's viminfo file.
8   When there is no .viminfo file and someone does "su", runs Vim, a
    root-owned .viminfo file is created.  Is there a good way to avoid this?
    Perhaps check the owner of the directory.  Only when root?
8   Add argument to keep the list of buffers when Vim is started with a file
    name. (Schild)
8   Keep the last used directory of the file browser (File/Open menu).
8   Remember the last used register for "@@".
8   Remember the redo buffer, so that "." works after restarting.
8   Remember a list of last accessed files.  To be used in the
    "File.Open Recent" menu.  Default is to remember 10 files or so.
    Also remember which files have been read and written.  How to display
    this?
7   Also store the ". register (last inserted text).
7   Make it possible to store buffer names in viminfo file relative to some
    directory, to make them portable over a network. (Aaron)
6   Store a snapshot of the currently opened windows.  So that when quitting
    Vim, and then starting again (without a file name argument), you see the
    same files in the windows.  Use ":mksession" code?
-   Make marks present in .viminfo usable as file marks: Display a list of
    "last visited files" and select one to jump to.


Modelines:
8   Before trying to execute a modeline, check that it looks like one (valid
    option names).  If it's very wrong, silently ignore it.
    Ignore a line that starts with "Subject: ".
-   Add an option to whitelist options that are allowed in a modeline.  This
    would allow careful users to use modelines, e.g., only allowing
    'shiftwidth'.
-   Add an option to let modelines only set local options, not global ones
    such as 'encoding'.
-   When an option value is coming from a modeline, do not carry it over to
    another edited file?  Would need to remember the value from before the
    modeline setting.
-   Allow setting a variable from a modeline?  Only allow using fixed strings,
    no function calls, to avoid a security problem.
-   Allow ":doauto BufRead x.cpp" in modelines, to execute autocommands for
    .cpp files.
-   Support the "abbreviate" command in modelines (Kearns).  Careful for
    characters after <Esc>, that is a security leak.
-   Add option setting to ask user if he wants to have the modelines executed
    or not.  Same for .exrc in local dir.


Sessions:
8   DOS/Windows: ":mksession" generates a "cd" command where "aa\#bb" means
    directory "#bb" in "aa", but it's used as "aa#bb". (Ronald Hoellwarth)
7   When there is a "help.txt" window in a session file, restoring that
    session will not get the "LOCAL ADDITIONS" back.
8   With ":mksession" always store the 'sessionoptions' option, even when
    "options" isn't in it. (St-Amant)
8   When using ":mksession", also store a command to reset all options to
    their default value, before setting the options that are not at their
    default value.
7   With ":mksession" also store the tag stack and jump history. (Michal
    Malecki)
7   Persistent variables: "p:var"; stored in viminfo file and sessions files.


Options:
7   ":with option=value | command": temporarily set an option value and
    restore it after the command has executed.
8   Make "old" number options that really give a number of effects into string
    options that are a comma separated list.  The old number values should
    also be supported.
8   Add commands to save and restore an option, which also preserves the flag
    that marks if the option was set.  Useful to keep the effect of setting
    'compatible' after ":syntax on" has been used.
7   There is 'titleold', why is there no 'iconold'? (Chazelas)
7   Make 'scrolloff' a global-local option, so that it can be different in the
    quickfix window, for example. (Gary Holloway)
    Also do 'sidescrolloff'.


External commands:
8   When filtering text, redirect stderr so that it can't mess up the screen
    and Vim doesn't need to redraw it.  Also for ":r !cmd".
4   Set separate shell for ":sh", piping "range!filter", reading text "r !ls"
    and writing text "w !wc". (Deutsche)  Allow arguments for fast start (e.g.
    -f).
4   Allow direct execution, without using a shell.
4   Run an external command in the background.  But how about I/O in the GUI?
    Careful: don't turn Vim into a shell!
4   Add feature to disable using a shell or external commands.


Multiple Windows:
7   "vim -oO file ..." use both horizontal and vertical splits.
8   Add CTRL-W T: go to the top window in the column of the current window.
    And CTRL-W B: go to bottom window.
7   Use CTRL-W <Tab>, like alt-tab, to switch between buffers.  Repeat <Tab>
    to select another buffer (only loaded ones?), <BS> to go back, <Enter> to
    select buffer, <Esc> to go back to original buffer.
7   Make it possible to edit a new buffer in the preview window.  A script can
    then fill it with something.  ":popen"?
7   Add a 'tool' window: behaves like a preview window but there can be
    several.  Don't count it in only_one_window(). (Alexei Alexandrov)
6   Add an option to resize the shell when splitting and/or closing a window.
    ":vsp" would make the shell wider by as many columns as needed for the new
    window.  Specify a maximum size (or use the screen size).  ":close" would
    shrink the shell by as many columns as come available. (Demirel)
7   When starting Vim several times, instantiate a Vim server, that allows
    communication between the different Vims.  Feels like one Vim running with
    multiple top-level windows.  Esp. useful when Vim is started from an IDE
    too.  Requires some form of inter process communication.
-   Support a connection to an external viewer.  Could call the viewer
    automatically after some seconds of non-activity, or with a command.
    Allow some way of reporting scrolling and cursor positioning in the viewer
    to Vim, so that the link between the viewed and edited text can be made.


Marks:
8   Add ten marks for last changed files: ':0, ':1, etc.  One mark per file.
8   When cursor is first moved because of scrolling, set a mark at this
    position.  (Rimon Barr)  Use '-.
8   Add a command to jump to a mark and make the motion inclusive.  g'm and g`m?
8   The '" mark is set to the first line, even when doing ":next" a few times.
    Only set the '" mark when the cursor was really moved in a file.
8   Make `` and '', which would position the new cursor position in the middle
    of the window, restore the old topline (or relative position) from when
    the mark was set.
7   Make a list of file marks in a separate window.  For listing all buffers,
    matching tags, errors, etc.  Normal commands to move around.  Add commands
    to jump to the mark (in current window or new window).  Start it with
    ":browse marks"?
6   Add a menu that lists the Marks like ":marks". (Amerige)
7   For ":jumps", ":tags" and ":marks", for not loaded buffers, remember the
    text at the mark.  Highlight the column with the mark.
7   Highlight each mark in some way (With "Mark" highlight group).
    Or display marks in a separate column, like 'number' does.
7   Use d"m to delete rectangular area from cursor to mark m (like Vile's \m
    command).
7   Try to keep marks in the same position when:
    - replacing with a line break, like in ":s/pat/^M/", move marks after the
      line break column to the next line. (Acevedo)
    - inserting/deleting characters in a line.
5   Include marks for start/end of the current word and section.  Useful in
    mappings.
6   Add "unnamed mark" feature: Like marks for the ":g" command, but place and
    unplace them with commands before doing something with the lines.
    Highlight the marked lines somehow.


Digraphs:
7   Make "ga" show the keymap for a character, if it exists.
    Also show the code of the character after conversion to 'fileencoding'.
-   Use digraph table to tell Vim about the collating sequence of special
    characters?
8   Add command to remove one or more (all) digraphs. (Brown)
7   Support different sets of digraphs (depending on the character set?).  At
    least Latin1/Unicode, Latin-2, MS-DOS (esp. for Win32).


Writing files:
-   In vim_rename(), should lock "from" file when deleting "to" file.
8   When appending to a file, Vim should also make a backup and a 'patchmode'
    file.
8   'backupskip' doesn't write a backup file at all, a bit dangerous for some
    applications.  Add 'backupelsewhere' to write a backup file in another
    directory?  Or add a flag to 'backupdir'?
6   Add an option to write a new, numbered, backup file each time.  Like
    'patchmode', e.g., 'backupmode'.
6   Make it possible to write 'patchmode' files to a different directory.
    E.g., ":set patchmode=~/backups/*.orig". (Thomas)
6   Add an option to prepend something to the backup file name.  E.g., "#".
    Or maybe allow a function to modify the backup file name?
8   Only make a backup when overwriting a file for the first time.  Avoids
    losing the original when writing twice. (Slootman)
7   On non-Unix machines, also overwrite the original file in some situations
    (file system full, it's a link on an NFS partition).
7   When editing a file, check that it has been change outside of Vim more
    often, not only when writing over it.  E.g., at the time the swap file is
    flushed.  Or every ten seconds or so (use the time of day, check it before
    waiting for a character to be typed).
8   When a file was changed since editing started, show this in the status
    line of the window, like "[time]".
    Make it easier to reload all outdated files that don't have changes.
    Automatic and/or with a command.


Substitute:
8   Substitute with hex/unicode number "\%xff" and "\%uabcd".  Just like
    "\%uabcd" in search pattern.
8   Make it easier to replace in all files in the argument list.  E.g.:
    ":argsub/oldword/newword/".  Works like ":argdo %s/oldword/newword/g|w".
-   :s///p prints the line after a substitution.
-   With :s///c replace \&, ~, etc. when showing the replacement pattern.
8   With :s///c allow scrolling horizontally when 'nowrap' is effective.
    Also allow a count before the scrolling keys.
-   Add number option to ":s//2": replace second occurrence of string?  Or:
    :s///N substitutes N times.
-   Add answers to ":substitute" with 'c' flag, used in a ":global", e.g.:
    ":g/pat1/s/pat2/pat3/cg": 'A' do all remaining replacements, 'Q' don't do
    any replacements, 'u' undo last substitution.
7   Substitute in a block of text.  Use {line}.{column} notation in an Ex
    range, e.g.: ":1.3,$.5s" means to substitute from line 1 column 3 to the
    last line column 5.
5   Add commands to bookmark lines, display bookmarks, remove bookmarks,
    operate on lines with bookmarks, etc.  Like ":global" but with the
    possibility to keep the bookmarks and use them with several commands.
    (Stanislav Sitar)


Mouse support:
8   Add 'o' flag to 'mouse'?
7   Be able to set a 'mouseshape' for the popup menu.
8   Add 'mouse' flag, which sets a behavior like Visual mode, but automatic
    yanking at the button-up event.  Or like Select mode, but typing gets you
    out of Select mode, instead of replacing the text. (Bhaskar)
-   Using right mouse button to extend a blockwise selection should attach to
    the nearest corner of the rectangle (four possible corners).
-   Precede mouse click by a number to simulate double clicks?!?
-   When mouse click after 'r' command, get character that was pointed to.


Argument list:
6   Add command to put all filenames from the tag files in the argument list.
    When given an argument, only use the files where that argument matches
    (like `grep -l ident`) and jump to the first match.
6   Add command to form an args list from all the buffers?


Registers:
8   Don't display empty registers with ":display". (Etienne)
8   Add put command that overwrites existing text.  Should also work for
    blocks.  Useful to move text around in a table.  Works like using "R ^R r"
    for every line.
6   When yanking into the unnamed registers several times, somehow make the
    previous contents also available (like it's done for deleting).  What
    register names to use?  g"1, g"2, etc.?
-   When appending to a register, also report the total resulting number of
    lines.  Or just say "99 more lines yanked", add the "more".
-   When inserting a register in Insert mode with CTRL-R, don't insert comment
    leader when line wraps?
-   The ":@r" commands should take a range and execute the register for each
    line in the range.
-   Add "P" command to insert contents of unnamed register, move selected text
	to position of previous deleted (to swap foo and bar in " + foo")
8   Should be able to yank and delete into the "/ register.
    How to take care of the flags (offset, magic)?


Debug mode:
7   Add something to enable debugging when a remote message is received.
8   Add breakpoints for setting an option
8   Add breakpoints for assigning to a variable.
7   Add a watchpoint in the debug mode: An expression that breaks execution
    when evaluating to non-zero.  Add the "watchadd expr" command, stop when
    the value of the expression changes.  ":watchdel" deletes an item,
    ":watchlist" lists the items. (Charles Campbell)
7   Store the history from debug mode in viminfo.
7   Make the debug mode history available with histget() et al.


Various improvements:
7   Add plugins for formatting?  Should be able to make a choice depending on
    the language of a file (English/Korean/Japanese/etc.).
    Setting the 'langformat' option to "chinese" would load the
    "format/chinese.vim" plugin.
    The plugin would set 'formatexpr' and define the function being called.
    Edward L. Fox explains how it should be done for most Asian languages.
    (2005 Nov 24)
    Alternative: patch for utf-8 line breaking. (Yongwei Wu, 2008 Feb 23)
7   [t to move to previous xml/html tag (like "vatov"), ]t to move to next
    ("vatv").
7   [< to move to previous xml/html tag, e.g., previous <li>. ]< to move to
    next <li>, ]< to next </li>, [< to previous </li>.
8   Add ":rename" command: rename the file of the current buffer and rename
    the buffer.  Buffer may be modified.
7   Instead of filtering errors with a shell script it should be possible to
    do this with Vim script.  A function that filters the raw text that comes
    from the 'makeprg'?
-   Add %b to 'errorformat': buffer number. (Yegappan Lakshmanan / Suresh
    Govindachar)
7   Add a command that goes back to the position from before jumping to the
    first quickfix location.  ":cbefore"?
7   Allow a window not to have a statusline.  Makes it possible to use a
    window as a buffer-tab selection.
8   Allow non-active windows to have a different statusline. (Yakov Lerner)
7   Support using ":vert" with User commands.  Add expandable items <vert>.
    Do the same for ":browse" and ":confirm"?
    For ":silent" and ":debug" apply to the whole user command.
    More general: need a way to access command modifiers in a user command.
    Assign them to a v: variable?
7   Add an invisible buffer which can be edited.  For use in scripts that want
    to manipulate text without changing the window layout.
8   Add a command to revert to the saved version of file; undo or redo until
    all changes are gone.
6   "vim -q -" should read the list of errors from stdin. (Gautam Mudunuri)
8   Add "--remote-fail": When contacting the server fails, exit Vim.
    Add "--remote-self": When contacting the server fails, do it in this Vim.
    Overrules the default of "--remote-send" to fail and "--remote" to do it
    in this Vim.
8   When Vim was started without a server, make it possible to start one, as
    if the "--servername" argument was given.  ":startserver <name>"?
8   No address range can be used before the command modifiers.  This makes
    them difficult to use in a menu for Visual mode.  Accept the range and
    have it apply to the following command.
8   Add the possibility to set 'fileformats' to force a format and strip other
    CR characters.  For example, for "dos" files remove CR characters at the
    end of the line, so that a file with mixed line endings is cleaned up.
    To just not display the CR characters: Add a flag to 'display'?
7   Some compilers give error messages in which the file name does not have a
    path.  Be able to specify that 'path' is used for these files.
7   Xterm sends <Esc>O3F for <M-End>.  Similarly for other <M-Home>, <M-Left>,
    etc.  Combinations of Alt, Ctrl and Shift are also possible.  Recognize
    these to avoid inserting the raw byte sequence, handle like the key
    without modifier (unless mapped).
6   Add "gG": like what "gj" is to "j": go to the N'th window line.
8   Add command like ":normal" that accepts <Key> notation like ":map".
9   Support ACLs on more systems.
7   Add ModeMsgVisual, ModeMsgInsert, etc. so that each mode message can be
    highlighted differently.
7   Add a message area for the user.  Set some option to reserve space (above
    the command line?).  Use an ":echouser" command to display the message
    (truncated to fit in the space).
7   Add %s to 'keywordprg': replace with word under the cursor. (Zellner)
8   Support printing on Unix.  Can use "lpansi.c" as an example. (Bookout)
8   Add put command that replaces the text under it.  Esp. for blockwise
    Visual mode.
7   Enhance termresponse stuff: Add t_CV(?): pattern of term response, use
    regexp: "\e\[[>?][0-9;]*c", but only check just after sending t_RV.
7   Add "g|" command: move to N'th column from the left margin (after wrapping
    and applying 'leftcol').  Works as "|" like what "g0" is to "0".
7   Support setting 'equalprg' to a user function name.
7   Highlight the characters after the end-of-line differently.
7   When 'whichwrap' contains "l", "$dl" should join lines?
8   Add an argument to configure to use $CFLAGS and not modify it? (Mooney)
8   Enabling features is a mix of configure arguments and defines in
    feature.h.  How to make this consistent?  Feature.h is required for
    non-unix systems.  Perhaps let configure define CONF_XXX, and use #ifdef
    CONF_XXX in feature.h?  Then what should min-features and max-features do?
8   Add "g^E" and "g^Y", to scroll a screen-full line up and down.
6   Add ":timer" command, to set a command to be executed at a certain
    interval, or once after some time has elapsed. (Aaron)
    Perhaps an autocommand event like CursorHold is better?
    Patch to add async functionality. (Geoff Greer, 2013 Sep 1 and later)
8   Add ":confirm" handling in open_exfile(), for when file already exists.
8   When quitting with changed files, make the dialog list the changed file
    and allow "write all", "discard all", "write some".  The last one would
    then ask "write" or "discard" for each changed file.  Patch in HierAssist
    does something like this. (Shah)
7   Use growarray for replace stack.
7   Have a look at viH (Hellenic or Greek version of Vim).  But a solution
    outside of Vim might be satisfactory (Haritsis).
3   Make "2d%" work like "d%d%" instead of "d2%"?
7   "g CTRL-O" jumps back to last used buffer.	Skip CTRL-O jumps in the same
    buffer.  Make jumplist remember the last ten accessed buffers?
7   Make it possible to set the size of the jumplist (also to a smaller number
    than the default). (Nikolai Weibull)
-   Add code to disable the CAPS key when going from Insert to Normal mode.
-   Set date/protection/etc. of the patchfile the same as the original file.
-   Use growarray for termcodes[] in term.c
-   Add <window-99>, like <cword> but use filename of 99'th window.
7   Add a way to change an operator to always work characterwise-inclusive
    (like "v" makes the operator characterwise-exclusive).  "x" could be used.
-   Make a set of operations on list of names: expand wildcards, replace home
    dir, append a string, delete a string, etc.
-   Remove using mktemp() and use tmpname() only?  Ctags does this.
-   When replacing environment variables, and there is one that is not set,
    turn it into an empty string?  Only when expanding options? (Hiebert)
-   Option to set command to be executed instead of producing a beep (e.g. to
    call "play newbeep.au").
-   Add option to show the current function name in the status line.  More or
    less what you find with "[[k", like how 'cindent' recognizes a function.
    (Bhatt).
-   "[r" and "]r": like "p" and "P", but replace instead of insert (esp. for
    blockwise registers).
-   Add 'timecheck' option, on by default.  Makes it possible to switch off the
    timestamp warning and question. (Dodt).
-   Add an option to set the time after which Vim should check the timestamps
    of the files.  Only check when an event occurs (e.g., character typed,
    mouse moved).  Useful for non-GUI versions where keyboard focus isn't
    noticeable.
-   Make 'smartcase' work even though 'ic' isn't set (Webb).
7   When formatting text, allow to break the line at a number of characters.
    Use an option for this: 'breakchars'?  Useful for formatting Fortran code.
-   Add flag to 'formatoptions' to be able to format book-style paragraphs
    (first line of paragraph has larger indent, no empty lines between
    paragraphs).  Complements the '2' flag.  Use '>' flag when larger indent
    starts a new paragraph, use '<' flag when smaller indent starts a new
    paragraph.	Both start a new paragraph on any indent change.
8   The 'a' flag in 'formatoptions' is too dangerous.  In some way only do
    auto-formatting in specific regions, e.g. defined by syntax highlighting.
8   Allow using a trailing space to signal a paragraph that continues on the
    next line (MIME text/plain; format=flowed, RFC 2646).  Can be used for
    continuous formatting.  Could use 'autoformat' option, which specifies a
    regexp which triggers auto-formatting (for one line).
    ":set autoformat=\\s$".
-   Be able to redefine where a sentence stops.  Use a regexp pattern?
-   Support multi-byte characters for sentences.  Example from Ben Peterson.
7   Add command "g)" to go to the end of a sentence, "g(" to go back to the
    end of a sentence. (Servatius Brandt)
-   Be able to redefine where a paragraph starts.  For "[[" where the '{' is
    not in column 1.
6   Add ":cdprev": go back to the previous directory.  Need to remember a
    stack of previous directories.  We also need ":cdnext".
7   Should ":cd" for MS-DOS go to $HOME, when it's defined?
-   Make "gq<CR>" work on the last line in the file.  Maybe for every operator?
-   Add more redirecting of Ex commands:
	:redir #>  bufname
	:redir #>> bufname   (append)
-   Give error message when starting :redir: twice or using END when no
    redirection was active.
-   Setting of options, specifically for a buffer or window, with
    ":set window.option" or ":set buffer.option=val".  Or use ":buffer.set".
    Also: "buffer.map <F1> quit".
6   Would it be possible to change the color of the cursor in the Win32
    console?  (Klaus Hast)
-   Add :delcr command:
			    *:delcr*
     :[range]delcr[!]	Check [range] lines (default: whole buffer) for lines
			ending in <CR>.  If all lines end in <CR>, or [!] is
			used, remove the <CR> at the end of lines in [range].
			A CTRL-Z at the end of the file is removed.  If
			[range] is omitted, or it is the whole file, and all
			lines end in <CR> 'textmode' is set.
-   Should integrate addstar() and file_pat_to_reg_pat().
-   When working over a serial line with 7 bit characters, remove meta
    characters from 'isprint'.
-   Use fchdir() in init_homedir(), like in FullName().
-   In win_update(), when the GUI is active, always use the scrolling area.
    Avoid that the last status line is deleted and needs to be redrawn.
-   That "cTx" fails when the cursor is just after 'x' is Vi compatible, but
    may not be what you expect.  Add a flag in 'cpoptions' for this?  More
    general: Add an option to allow "c" to work with a null motion.
-   Give better error messages by using errno (strerror()).
-   Give "Usage:" error message when command used with wrong arguments (like
    Nvi).
-   Make 'restorescreen' option also work for xterm (and others), replaces the
    SAVE_XTERM_SCREEN define.
7   Support for ":winpos" In xterm: report the current window position.
-   Give warning message when using ":set t_xx=asdf" for a termcap code that
    Vim doesn't know about.  Add flag in 'shortmess'?
6   Add ":che <file>", list all the include paths which lead to this file.
-   For a commandline that has several commands (:s, :d, etc.) summarize the
    changes all together instead of for each command (e.g. for the rot13
    macro).
-   Add command like "[I" that also shows the tree of included files.
-   ":set sm^L" results in ":set s", because short names of options are also
    expanded.  Is there a better way to do this?
-   Add ":@!" command, to ":@" like what ":source!" is to ":source".
8   Add ":@:!": repeat last command with forceit set.
-   Add 't_normal': Used whenever t_me, t_se, t_ue or t_Zr is empty.
-   ":cab map test ^V| je", ":cunab map" doesn't work.	This is vi compatible!
-   CTRL-W CTRL-E and CTRL-W CTRL-Y should move the current window up or down
    if it is not the first or last window.
-   Include-file-search commands should look in the loaded buffer of a file (if
    there is one) instead of the file itself.
7   Change 'nrformats' to include the leader for each format.  Example:
	nrformats=hex:$,binary:b,octal:0
    Add setting of 'nrformats' to syntax files.
-   'path' can become very long, don't use NameBuff for expansion.
-   When unhiding a hidden buffer, put the same line at top of the window as
    the one before hiding it.  Or: keep the same relative cursor position (so
    many percent down the windows).
-   Make it possible for the 'showbreak' to be displayed at the end of the
    line.  Use a comma to separate the part at the end and the start of the
    line?  Highlight the linebreak characters, add flag in 'highlight'.
    Make 'showbreak' local to a window.
-   Some string options should be expanded if they have wildcards, e.g.
    'dictionary' when it is "*.h".
-   Use a specific type for number and boolean options, making it possible to
    change it for specific machines (e.g. when a long is 64 bit).
-   Add option for <Insert> in replace mode going to normal mode. (Nugent)
-   Add a next/previous possibility to "[^I" and friends.
-   Add possibility to change the HOME directory.  Use the directory from the
    passwd file? (Antwerpen)
8   Add commands to push and pop all or individual options. ":setpush tw",
    ":setpop tw", ":setpush all".  Maybe pushing/popping all options is
    sufficient.  ":setflush" resets the option stack?
    How to handle an aborted mapping?  Remember position in tag stack when
    mapping starts, restore it when an error aborts the mapping?
-   "gc": goto character, move absolute character positions forward, also
    counting newlines.  "gC" goes backwards (Weigert).
-   When doing CTRL-^, redraw buffer with the same topline. (Demirel)  Store
    cursor row and window height to redraw cursor at same percentage of window
    (Webb).
-   Besides remembering the last used line number of a file, also remember the
    column.  Use it with CTRL-^ et. al.
-   Check for non-digits when setting a number option (careful when entering
    hex codes like 0xff).
-   Add option to make "." redo the "@r" command, instead of the last command
    executed by it.  Also to make "." redo the whole mapping.  Basically: redo
    the last TYPED command.
-   Support URL links for ^X^F in Insert mode, like for "gf".
-   Support %name% expansion for "gf" on Windows.
-   Make "gf" work on "file://c:/path/name".  "file:/c:/" and "file:///c:/"
    should also work?
-   Add 'urlpath', used like 'path' for when "gf" used on an URL?
8   When using "gf" on an absolute file name, while editing a remote file
    (starts with scp:// or http://) should prepend the method and machine
    name.
-   When finding an URL or file name, and it doesn't exist, try removing a
    trailing '.'.
-   Add ":path" command modifier.  Should work for every command that takes a
    file name argument, to search for the file name in 'path'.	Use
    find_file_in_path().
-   Highlight control characters on the screen: Shows the difference between
    CTRL-X and "^" followed by "X" (Colon).
-   Integrate parsing of cmdline command and parsing for expansion.
-   Create a program that can translate a .swp file from any machine into a
    form usable by Vim on the current machine.
-   Add ":noro" command: Reset 'ro' flag for all buffers, except ones that have
    a readonly file.  ":noro!" will reset all 'ro' flags.
-   Add a variant of CTRL-V that stops interpretation of more than one
    character.	For entering mappings on the command line where a key contains
    several special characters, e.g. a trailing newline.
-   Make '2' option in 'formatoptions' also work inside comments.
-   Add 's' flag to 'formatoptions': Do not break when inside a string. (Dodt)
-   When window size changed (with the mouse) and made too small, set it back
    to the minimal size.
-   Add "]>" and "[<", shift comment at end of line (command;  /* comment */).
-   Should not call cursorcmd() for each vgetc() in getcmdline().
-   ":split file1 file2" adds two more windows (Webb).
-   Don't give message "Incomplete last line" when editing binary file.
-   Add ":a", ":i" for preloading of named buffers.
-   When entering text, keep other windows on same buffer updated (when a line
    entered)?
-   Check out how screen does output optimizing.  Apparently this is possible
    as an output filter.
-   In dosub() regexec is called twice for the same line.  Try to avoid this.
-   Window updating from memline.c: insert/delete/replace line.
-   Optimize ml_append() for speed, esp. for reading a file.
-   V..c should keep indent when 'ai' is set, just like [count]cc.
-   Updatescript() can be done faster with a string instead of a char.
-   Screen updating is inefficient with CTRL-F and CTRL-B when there are long
    lines.
-   Uppercase characters in Ex commands can be made lowercase?
8   Add option to show characters in text not as "|A" but as decimal ("^129"),
    hex ("\x81") or octal ("\201") or meta (M-x).  Nvi has the 'octal' option
    to switch from hex to octal.  Vile can show unprintable characters in hex
    or in octal.
7   Tighter integration with xxd to edit binary files.  Make it more
    easy/obvious to use.  Command line argument?
-   How does vi detect whether a filter has messed up the screen?  Check source.
    After ":w !command" a wait_return?
-   Improve screen updating code for doput() (use s_ins()).
-   With 'p' command on last line: scroll screen up (also for terminals without
    insert line command).
-   Use insert/delete char when terminal supports it.
-   Optimize screen redraw for slow terminals.
-   Optimize "dw" for long row of spaces (say, 30000).
-   Add "-d null" for editing from a script file without displaying.
-   In Insert mode: Remember the characters that were removed with backspace
    and re-insert them one at a time with <key1>, all together with <key2>.
-   Implement 'redraw' option.
-   Add special code to 'sections' option to define something else but '{' or
    '}' as the start of a section (e.g. one shiftwidth to the right).
7   Allow using Vim in a pipe: "ls | vim -u xxx.vim - | yyy".  Only needs
    implementing ":w" to stdout in the buffer that was read from stdin.
    Perhaps writing to stdout will work, since stderr is used for the terminal
    I/O.
8   Allow opening an unnamed buffer with ":e !cmd" and ":sp !cmd".  Vile can
    do it.
-   Add commands like ]] and [[ that do not include the line jumped to.
-   When :unab without matching "from" part and several matching "to" parts,
    delete the entry that was used last, instead of the first in the list.
-   Add text justification option.
-   Set boolean options on/off with ":set paste=off", ":set paste=on".
-   After "inv"ing an option show the value: ":set invpaste" gives "paste is
    off".
-   Check handling of CTRL-V and '\' for ":" commands that do not have TRLBAR.
-   When a file cannot be opened but does exist, give error message.
-   When writing check for file exists but no permission, "Permission denied".
-   If file does not exist, check if directory exists.
-   MSDOS: although t_cv and t_ci are not set, do invert char under cursor.
-   Settings edit mode: make file with ":set opt=xx", edit it, parse it as ex
    commands.
-   ":set -w all": list one option per line.
-   :table command (Webb)
-   Add new operator: clear, make area white (replace with spaces): "g ".
-   Add command to ":read" a file at a certain column (blockwise read?).
-   Add sort of replace mode where case is taken from the old text (Goldfarb).
-   Allow multiple arguments for ":read", read all the files.
-   Support for tabs in specific columns: ":set tabcol=8,20,34,56" (Demirel).
-   Add 'searchdir' option: Directories to search for file name being edited
    (Demirel).
-   Modifier for the put command: Change to linewise, charwise, blockwise, etc.
-   Add commands for saving and restoring options ":set save" "set restore",
    for use in macro's and the like.
-   Keep output from listings in a window, so you can have a look at it while
    working in another window.  Put cmdline in a separate window?
-   Add possibility to put output of Ex commands in a buffer or file, e.g. for
    ":set all".  ":r :set all"?
-   When the 'equalalways' option is set, creating a new window should not
    result in windows to become bigger.  Deleting a window should not result in
    a window to become smaller (Webb).
-   When resizing the whole Vim window, the windows inside should be resized
    proportionally (Webb).
-   Include options directly in option table, no indirect pointers.  Use
    mkopttab to make option table?
-   When doing ":w dir", where "dir" is a directory name, write the current
    file into that directory, with the current file name (without the path)?
-   Support for 'dictionary's that are sorted, makes access a lot faster
    (Haritsis).
-   Add "^Vrx" on the command line, replace with contents of register x.  Used
    instead of CTRL-R to make repeating possible. (Marinichev)
-   Add "^Vb" on the command line, replace with word before or under the
    cursor?
-   Option to make a .swp file only when a change is made (Templeton).
-   Support mapping for replace mode and "r" command (Vi doesn't do this)?
5   Add 'ignorefilecase' option: Ignore case when expanding file names.
    ":e ma<Tab>" would also find "Makefile" on Unix.
8   Sorting of filenames for completion is wrong on systems that ignore
    case of filenames.  Add 'ignorefncase' option.  When set, case in
    filenames is ignored for sorting them. Patch by Mike Williams:
    ~/vim/patches/ignorefncase.  Also change what matches?  Or use another
    option name.
8   Should be able to compile Vim in another directory, with $(srcdir) set to
    where the sources are. Add $(srcdir) in the Makefile in a lot of places.
    (Netherton)
6   Make it configurable when "J" inserts a space or not.  Should not add a
    space after "(", for example.
5   When inserting spaces after the end-of-line for 'virtualedit', use tabs
    when the user wants this (e.g., add a "tab" field to 'virtualedit').
    (Servatius Brandt)


From Elvis:
-   Use "instman.sh" to install manpages?
-   Add ":alias" command.
-   Search patterns:
      \@	match word under cursor.
    but do:
      \@w	match the word under the cursor?
      \@W	match the WORD under the cursor?
8   ":window" command:
    :win +	next window (up)
    :win ++	idem, wrapping
    :win -	previous window (down)
    :win --	idem, wrapping
    :win nr	to window number "nr"
    :win name	to window editing buffer "name"
7   ":cc" compiles a single file (default: current one).  'ccprg'   option is
    program to use with ":cc".  Use ":compile" instead of ":cc"?


From xvi:
-   CTRL-_ : swap 8th bit of character.
-   Add egrep-like regex type, like xvi (Ned Konz) or Perl (Emmanuel Mogenet)


From vile:
-   When horizontal scrolling, use '>' for lines continuing right of a window.
-   Support putting .swp files in /tmp: Command in rc.local to move .swp files
    from /tmp to some directory before deleting files.


Far future and "big" extensions:
-   Instead of using a Makefile and autoconf, use a simple shell script to
    find the C compiler and do everything with C code.  Translate something
    like an Aap recipe and configure.in to C.  Avoids depending on Python,
    thus will work everywhere.  With batch file to find the C compiler it
    would also work on MS-Windows.
-   Make it easy to setup Vim for groups of users: novice vi users, novice
    Vim users, C programmers, xterm users, GUI users,...
-   Change layout of blocks in swap file: Text at the start, with '\n' in
    between lines (just load the file without changes, except for Mac).
    Indexes for lines are from the end of the block backwards.  It's the
    current layout mirrored.
-   Make it possible to edit a register, in a window, like a buffer.
-   Add stuff to syntax highlighting to change the text (upper-case keywords,
    set indent, define other highlighting, etc.).
-   Mode to keep C-code formatted all the time (sort of on-line indent).
-   Several top-level windows in one Vim session.  Be able to use a different
    font in each top-level window.
-   Allow editing above start and below end of buffer (flag in 'virtualedit').
-   Smart cut/paste: recognize words and adjust spaces before/after them.
-   Add open mode, use it when terminal has no cursor positioning.
-   Special "drawing mode": a line is drawn where the cursor is moved to.
    Backspace deletes along the line (from jvim).
-   Implement ":Bset", set option in all buffers.  Also ":Wset", set in all
    windows, ":Aset, set in all arguments and ":Tset", set in all files
    mentioned in the tags file.
    Add buffer/arg range, like in ":2,5B%s/..." (do we really need this???)
    Add search string: "B/*.c/%s/.."?  Or ":F/*.c/%s/.."?
-   Support for underlining (underscore-BS-char), bold (char-BS-char) and other
    standout modes switched on/off with , 'overstrike' option (Reiter).
-   Add vertical mode (Paul Jury, Demirel): "5vdw" deletes a word in five
    lines, "3vitextESC" will insert "text" in three lines, etc..
4   Recognize l, #, p as 'flags' to EX commands:
    :g/RE/#l shall print lines with line numbers and in list format.
    :g/RE/dp shall print lines that are deleted.
    POSIX: Commands where flags shall apply to all lines written: list,
    number, open, print, substitute, visual, &, z.  For other commands, flags
    shall apply to the current line after the command completes.  Examples:
    :7,10j #l Join the lines 7-10 and print the result in list
-   Allow two or more users to edit the same file at the same time.  Changes
    are reflected in each Vim immediately.  Could work with local files but
    also over the internet.  See http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/.

When using "do" or ":diffget" in a buffer with changes in every line an extra
empty line would appear.
