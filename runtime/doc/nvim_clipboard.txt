Clipboard integration for Nvim			       *nvim-clipboard*

Nvim has no direct connection to the system clipboard. Instead, it is
accessible through the |nvim-provider| infrastructure, which transparently
uses shell commands for communicating with the clipboard.

Clipboard access is implicitly enabled if any of the following clipboard tools
is found in your `$PATH`.

- xclip
- xsel (newer alternative to xclip)
- pbcopy/pbpaste (only for Mac OS X)

The presence of a suitable clipboard tool implicitly enables the '+' and '*'
registers.

If you want to ALWAYS use the clipboard for ALL operations (as opposed
to interacting with the '+' and/or '*' registers explicitly), set the
following option:
>
    set clipboard+=unnamedplus
<
See 'clipboard' for details and more options.
