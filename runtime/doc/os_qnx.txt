==============================================================================

1. General						*qnx-general*

Vim on QNX behaves much like other unix versions. |os_unix.txt|


2. Compiling Vim					*qnx-compiling*

Vim can be compiled using the standard configure/make approach.  If you want to
compile for X11, pass the --with-x option to configure.  Otherwise, running
./configure without any arguments or passing --enable-gui=photon, will compile
vim with the Photon gui support.  Run ./configure --help , to find out other
features you can enable/disable.


3. Terminal support					*qnx-terminal*

Vim has support for the mouse and clipboard in a pterm, if those options
are compiled in, which they are normally.

The options that affect mouse support are |'mouse'| and |'ttymouse'|.  When
using the mouse, only simple left and right mouse clicking/dragging is
supported.  If you hold down shift, ctrl, or alt while using the mouse, pterm
will handle the mouse itself.  It will make a selection, separate from what
vim's doing.

When the mouse is in use, you can press Alt-RightMouse to open the pterm menu.
To turn the mouse off in vim, set the mouse option to nothing, set mouse=


4. Photon GUI						*photon-gui*

To start the gui for vim, you need to run either gvim or vim -g, otherwise
the terminal version will run.  For more info - |gui-x11-start|

	:browse command					|:browse|
	:confirm command				|:confirm|
	Cursor blinking					|'guicursor'|

	different encodings, etc.

	This help file

Unsupported features:
	Find & Replace window				|:promptfind|
	Tearoff menus

	Other things which I can't think of so I can't list them


5. Fonts						*photon-fonts*

You set fonts in the gui with the guifont option >
	:set guifont=Lucida\ Terminal
<
The font must be a monospace font, and any spaces in the font name must be
escaped with a '\'.  The default font used is PC Terminal, size 8.  Using
'*' as the font name will open a standard Photon font selector where you can
select a font.

Following the name, you can include optional settings to control the size and
style of the font, each setting separated by a ':'.  Not all fonts support the
various styles.

The options are,
    s{size}	Set the size of the font to {size}
    b		Bold style
    a		Use antialiasing
    i		Italic style

Examples:

Set the font to monospace size 10 with antialiasing >
	:set guifont=monospace:s10:a
<
Set the font to Courier size 12, with bold and italics >
	:set guifont=Courier:s12:b:i
<
Select a font with the requester >
	:set guifont=*
<


6. Bugs & things To Do

Known problems:
	- Vim hangs sometimes when running an external program.  Workaround:
	  put this line in your |vimrc| file: >
		set noguipty

Bugs:
	- Still a slight problem with menu highlighting.
	- When using phditto/phinows/etc., if you are using a font that
	  doesn't support the bold attribute, when vim attempts to draw
	  bold text it will be all messed up.
	- The cursor can sometimes be hard to see.
	- A number of minor problems that can fixed. :)

Todo:
	- Improve multi-language support.
	- Options for setting the fonts used in the menu and toolbar.
	- Find & Replace dialog.
	- The clientserver features.
	- Maybe tearoff menus.

	- Replace usage of fork() with spawn() when launching external
	  programs.
