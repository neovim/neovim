Introduction                                                        *lua-plugin*

Writing a Lua plugin from scratch can be overwhelming. This tutorial is aimed
to provide basic guidance for it in the form of hands-on example. We will be
building a plugin called "no-trailing" with scope to provide functionality
to remove last (i.e. trailing) blank lines (i.e. containing only whitespace)
in the buffer.

An important disclaimer: Nvim allows flexible approaches to creating Lua
plugins and is constantly evolving. This tutorial intentionally omits
providing hard guidelines preferring instead to list some common approaches
with their pros and cons.

It is a good idea to understand at least basics of the following topics:

• Lua language. See |luaref| and |lua-concepts|.
• Lua in Nvim. See |lua-guide|.
• Reading and searching help. See |help.txt| and |:helpgrep|.
• File system operations, like creating file and directories.

==============================================================================
Lua code                                                        *lua-plugin-lua*

The core functionality of any Lua plugin is its code. It is located in `lua/`
subdirectory of the plugin.

First start by creating a directory `no-trailing/` inside your 'runtimepath'.
In this tutorial let's use the following path:
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site/pack/tutorial/start/no-trailing` (see |$XDG_DATA_HOME
for its value on your system). The reason to choose this complicated path is
because it utilizes built-in |packages| functionality to make this plugin
installed in your config.

The newly created `no-trailing/` directory will be treated as root for all
relative paths used here. In particular as a first commented line in code
blocks to describe where it should be placed.

Now let's create a `lua/no-trailing/init.lua` file. It will contain the Lua
code implementing core functionality. For plugin that removes trailing lines
it can be something like this:
>lua
    -- lua/no-trailing/init.lua

    -- Create a table to store and later return module's user facing functions
    -- Using `M` is a popular convention, but any name is possible
    local M = {}

    -- Create user facing function
    M.trim = function(buf_id, opts)
      -- Validate required arguments
      local ok, is_buf_valid = pcall(vim.api.nvim_buf_is_valid, buf_id)
      assert(ok and is_buf_valid, '`buf_id` is not a valid buffer identifier')

      -- Infer and validate optional arguments
      opts = vim.tbl_deep_extend('force', { empty = false }, opts or {})
      assert(type(opts.empty) == 'boolean', '`opts.empty` is not boolean')

      -- Compute number of the first line to be removed: iterate from the end
      -- backwards and stop when line is not target depending on `empty`
      local target_pattern = opts.empty and '^$' or '^%s*$'
      local lines = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(buf_id, 0, -1, false)
      local start_line
      for i = #lines, 1, -1 do
        if lines[i]:find(target_pattern) == nil then
          start_line = i
          break
        end
      end
      start_line = start_line or 0

      -- Remove trailing lines
      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf_id, start_line, -1, false, {})
    end

    -- Return the module. This must be the last of the file.
    return M
<
And this is it. You have create a Lua plugin. Users now can install it
(i.e. put the whole `no-trailing/` directory in their 'runtimepath' manually
or via plugin manager) and use it directly with `require()`:

• Any of `require('no-trailing').trim(0)`, `require('no-trailing').trim(0, {})`,
  or `require('no-trailing').trim(0, { empty = false })` removes all
  blank trailing lines.

• `require('no-trailing').trim(0, { empty = true })` removes only empty
  trailing lines.

• Any of `require('no-trailing').trim()`, `require('no-trailing').setup('a')`,
  `require('no-trailing').trim(0, { empty = 'a' })` will throw an error.

Notes:

• Choosing function scope (i.e. what it does) is up to you. Usually preferring
  the functionality just enough for it to be useful for target audience is
  a good approach. You can see what Nvim does in |dev-lua|.

• Choosing names for plugin/function/arguments/options is up to you. Usually
  choosing a short "to the point" yet descriptive name is a good approach.
  You can see what Nvim does in |dev-naming|.

• Choosing function signature (i.e its arguments) is up to you. Preferring
  first mandatory arguments followed by a single optional table `opts` with
  optional arguments is a common convention.
  You can see what Nvim uses in |dev-patterns| and |dev-api|.

• To interactively test latest plugin functionality, open separate fresh Nvim
  instance with plugin loaded and interact with it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Restructuring Lua code                                  *lua-plugin-restructure*

Using single Lua file in plugin is possible, yet may become not easy to manage
if it becomes too big. To overcome this, code can be split into separate
modules and used inside each other with |require()|.

In our 'no-trailing' plugin computation of the first trailing line can be
moved into a separate `lua/no-trailing/utils.lua` file:
>lua
    -- lua/no-trailing/utils.lua

    local M = {}

    M.get_last_trailing = function(buf_id, empty)
      local target_pattern = empty and '^$' or '^%s*$'
      local lines = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(buf_id, 0, -1, false)
      for i = #lines, 1, -1 do
        if lines[i]:find(target_pattern) == nil then
          -- Moving computation into a separate function allows using the
          -- "early return" pattern
          return i
        end
      end
      return 0
    end

    return M
<

Now there are two main approaches on how this can be used in main module:
eager loading and lazy loading.

Eager approach is about sourcing "helper" module during source "main" module:
>lua
    -- lua/no-trailing/init.lua

    local M = {}

    -- This will make initial source of 'no-trailing.utils' module
    -- during initial source of this module
    local utils = require('no-trailing.utils')

    M.trim = function(buf_id, opts)
      local ok, is_buf_valid = pcall(vim.api.nvim_buf_is_valid, buf_id)
      assert(ok and is_buf_valid, '`buf_id` is not a valid buffer identifier')

      opts = vim.tbl_deep_extend('force', { empty = false }, opts or {})
      assert(type(opts.empty) == 'boolean', '`opts.empty` is not boolean')

      local start_line = utils.get_last_trailing(buf_id, opts.empty)
      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf_id, start_line, -1, false, {})
    end

    return M
<
Lazy approach is about sourcing "helper" module during function execution:
>lua
    -- lua/no-trailing/init.lua

    local M = {}

    M.trim = function(buf_id, opts)
      local ok, is_buf_valid = pcall(vim.api.nvim_buf_is_valid, buf_id)
      assert(ok and is_buf_valid, '`buf_id` is not a valid buffer identifier')

      opts = vim.tbl_deep_extend('force', { empty = false }, opts or {})
      assert(type(opts.empty) == 'boolean', '`opts.empty` is not boolean')

      -- This will make initial source of 'no-trailing.utils' module
      -- during first function execution
      local utils = require('no-trailing.utils')
      local start_line = utils.get_last_trailing(buf_id, opts.empty)
      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf_id, start_line, -1, false, {})
    end

    return M
<
Both eager and lazy loading Lua modules have pros and cons:

• Eager loading leads to spending more time during initial source of main
  module, which is often during startup.
  Lazy loading spends that extra time only when it is needed.
  This rarely matters for small modules which only consists from function
  definitions, but can be significant for modules which do something time
  consuming during their initial source or in case of large amount of modules.

• Eager loading results in a more structured code with less lines.

• Lazy loading results in a constant calls of `require()` during each function
  execution. Although it caches its results, the time it spends to search the
  cache is not strictly zero, which leads to a very small overhead (usually
  order of fractions of a microsecond). This might matter for frequently
  called functions.

Usually both approaches are fine. Using eager loading and preferring lazy
loading for expensive to source modules is usually a good idea.

Miscellaneous                                                  *lua-plugin-misc*

All the basics of how to create a Lua plugin which nicely interacts with Nvim
is covered in previous sections.

However, there are still miscellaneous (completely optional!) recommendations
which can transform your plugin into a more stable project (if that is what
you want):

• Use version control system and releases. It enables more structured and
  streamlined updates. A popular choice is Git (https://git-scm.com/) with
  its tags following semantic versioning (https://semver.org/).

• Use public hosting. It enables easier installation and updates.
  A popular choice is GitHub (https://github.com/).

• Use automated formatter. It allows you and your future contributors to not
  think about formatting too much. A popular choice is StyLua
  (https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua).

• Use type annotations. It provides additional safety during writing code,
  relevant completion suggestions, and more. A popular choice is style from
  Lua language server (https://luals.github.io/).

• Use automated testing. It increases chances of new changes not breaking
  existing functionality. A popular choice is Busted Lua framework
  (https://github.com/lunarmodules/busted).

• Use continuous integration. This even more increases chances of not
  introducing unintentional breaking changes. A popular choice is Github
  Actions (https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
