==============================================================================
1. Filetypes					*filetypes* *file-types*

Vim can detect the type of file that is edited.  This is done by checking the
file name and sometimes by inspecting the contents of the file for specific
text.

							*:filetype* *:filet*
To enable file type detection, use this command in your vimrc: >
	:filetype on
Each time a new or existing file is edited, Vim will try to recognize the type
of the file and set the 'filetype' option.  This will trigger the FileType
event, which can be used to set the syntax highlighting, set options, etc.

Detail: The ":filetype on" command will load these files:
		$VIMRUNTIME/filetype.lua
		$VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
	filetype.lua creates an autocommand that fires for all BufNewFile and
	BufRead events. It tries to detect the filetype based off of the
	file's extension or name.

	filetype.vim is a Vim script that defines autocommands for the
	BufNewFile and BufRead events. In contrast to filetype.lua, this
	file creates separate BufNewFile and BufRead events for each filetype
	pattern.

	If the file type is not found by the name, the file
	$VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim is used to detect it from the contents of the
	file.
	When the GUI is running or will start soon, the |menu.vim| script is
	also sourced.

To add your own file types, see |new-filetype| below.  To search for help on a
filetype prepend "ft-" and optionally append "-syntax", "-indent" or
"-plugin".  For example: >
	:help ft-vim-indent
	:help ft-vim-syntax
	:help ft-man-plugin

If the file type is not detected automatically, or it finds the wrong type,
you can either set the 'filetype' option manually, or add a modeline to your
file.  Example, for an IDL file use the command: >
	:set filetype=idl

or add this |modeline| to the file: >
	/* vim: set filetype=idl : */
<
						*:filetype-plugin-on*
You can enable loading the plugin files for specific file types with: >
	:filetype plugin on
If filetype detection was not switched on yet, it will be as well.
This actually loads the file "ftplugin.vim" in 'runtimepath'.
The result is that when a file is edited its plugin file is loaded (if there
is one for the detected filetype). |filetype-plugin|

						*:filetype-plugin-off*
You can disable it again with: >
	:filetype plugin off
The filetype detection is not switched off then.  But if you do switch off
filetype detection, the plugins will not be loaded either.
This actually loads the file "ftplugof.vim" in 'runtimepath'.

						*:filetype-indent-on*
You can enable loading the indent file for specific file types with: >
	:filetype indent on
If filetype detection was not switched on yet, it will be as well.
This actually loads the file "indent.vim" in 'runtimepath'.
The result is that when a file is edited its indent file is loaded (if there
is one for the detected filetype). |indent-expression|

						*:filetype-indent-off*
You can disable it again with: >
	:filetype indent off
The filetype detection is not switched off then.  But if you do switch off
filetype detection, the indent files will not be loaded either.
This actually loads the file "indoff.vim" in 'runtimepath'.
This disables auto-indenting for files you will open.  It will keep working in
already opened files.  Reset 'autoindent', 'cindent', 'smartindent' and/or
'indentexpr' to disable indenting in an opened file.

						*:filetype-off*
To disable file type detection, use this command: >
	:filetype off
This will keep the flags for "plugin" and "indent", but since no file types
are being detected, they won't work until the next ":filetype on".


Overview:					*:filetype-overview*

command				detection	plugin		indent ~
:filetype on			on		unchanged	unchanged
:filetype off			off		unchanged	unchanged
:filetype plugin on		on		on		unchanged
:filetype plugin off		unchanged	off		unchanged
:filetype indent on		on		unchanged	on
:filetype indent off		unchanged	unchanged	off
:filetype plugin indent on	on		on		on
:filetype plugin indent off	unchanged	off		off

To see the current status, type: >
	:filetype
The output looks something like this: >
	filetype detection:ON  plugin:ON  indent:OFF

The file types are also used for syntax highlighting.  If the ":syntax on"
command is used, the file type detection is installed too.  There is no need
to do ":filetype on" after ":syntax on".

To disable one of the file types, add a line in your filetype file, see
|remove-filetype|.

							*filetype-detect*
To detect the file type again: >
	:filetype detect
Use this if you started with an empty file and typed text that makes it
possible to detect the file type.  For example, when you entered this in a
shell script: "#!/bin/csh".
   When filetype detection was off, it will be enabled first, like the "on"
argument was used.

							*filetype-overrule*
When the same extension is used for multiple filetypes, Vim tries to guess
what kind of file it is.  This doesn't always work.  A number of global
variables can be used to overrule the filetype used for certain extensions:

	file name	variable ~
	`*.asa`		g:filetype_asa		|ft-aspperl-syntax|
						|ft-aspvbs-syntax|
	`*.asm`		g:asmsyntax		|ft-asm-syntax|
	`*.asp`		g:filetype_asp		|ft-aspperl-syntax|
						|ft-aspvbs-syntax|
	`*.bas`		g:filetype_bas		|ft-basic-syntax|
	`*.cfg`		g:filetype_cfg
	`*.cls`		g:filetype_cls
	`*.csh`		g:filetype_csh		|ft-csh-syntax|
	`*.dat`		g:filetype_dat
	`*.def`		g:filetype_def
	`*.dsp`		g:filetype_dsp
	`*.f`		g:filetype_f		|ft-forth-syntax|
	`*.frm`		g:filetype_frm		|ft-form-syntax|
	`*.fs`		g:filetype_fs		|ft-forth-syntax|
	`*.h`		g:c_syntax_for_h	|ft-c-syntax|
	`*.i`		g:filetype_i		|ft-progress-syntax|
	`*.inc`		g:filetype_inc
	`*.lsl`		g:filetype_lsl
	`*.m`		g:filetype_m		|ft-mathematica-syntax|
	`*[mM]makefile,*.mk,*.mak,[mM]akefile*`
			g:make_flavor		|ft-make-syntax|
	`*.markdown,*.mdown,*.mkd,*.mkdn,*.mdwn,*.md`
			g:filetype_md		|ft-pandoc-syntax|
	`*.mod`		g:filetype_mod
	`*.p`		g:filetype_p		|ft-pascal-syntax|
	`*.pl`		g:filetype_pl
	`*.pp`		g:filetype_pp		|ft-pascal-syntax|
	`*.prg`		g:filetype_prg
	`*.r`		g:filetype_r
	`*.sig`		g:filetype_sig
	`*.sql`		g:filetype_sql		|ft-sql-syntax|
	`*.src`		g:filetype_src
	`*.sys`		g:filetype_sys
	`*.sh`		g:bash_is_sh		|ft-sh-syntax|
	`*.tex`		g:tex_flavor		|ft-tex-plugin|
	`*.typ`		g:filetype_typ
	`*.v`		g:filetype_v
	`*.w`		g:filetype_w		|ft-cweb-syntax|

For a few filetypes the global variable is used only when the filetype could
not be detected:
	`*.r`		g:filetype_r	|ft-rexx-syntax|

							*filetype-ignore*
To avoid that certain files are being inspected, the g:ft_ignore_pat variable
is used.  The default value is set like this: >
	:let g:ft_ignore_pat = '\.\(Z\|gz\|bz2\|zip\|tgz\)$'
This means that the contents of compressed files are not inspected.

							*new-filetype*
If a file type that you want to use is not detected yet, there are a few ways
to add it.  The recommended way is to use |vim.filetype.add()| to add it to
Nvim's builtin filetype detection mechanism.  If you want to handle the
detection manually, proceed as follows:

A. If you want to overrule all default file type checks.
   This works by writing one file for each filetype.  The disadvantage is that
   there can be many files.  The advantage is that you can simply drop this
   file in the right directory to make it work.
							*ftdetect*
   1. Create your user runtime directory.  You would normally use the first
      item of the 'runtimepath' option.  Then create the directory "ftdetect"
      inside it.  Example for Unix: >
	:!mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/ftdetect
<
   2. Create a file that contains an autocommand to detect the file type.
      Example: >
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.mine		set filetype=mine
<     Note that there is no "augroup" command, this has already been done
      when sourcing your file.  You could also use the pattern "*" and then
      check the contents of the file to recognize it.
      Write this file as "mine.vim" in the "ftdetect" directory in your user
      runtime directory.  For example, for Unix: >
	:w ~/.config/nvim/ftdetect/mine.vim

<  3. To use the new filetype detection you must restart Vim.

   The files in the "ftdetect" directory are used after all the default
   checks, thus they can overrule a previously detected file type.  But you
   can also use |:setfiletype| to keep a previously detected filetype.

B. If you want to detect your file after the default file type checks.

   This works like A above, but instead of setting 'filetype' unconditionally
   use ":setfiletype".  This will only set 'filetype' if no file type was
   detected yet.  Example: >
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt		setfiletype text
<
   You can also use the already detected file type in your command.  For
   example, to use the file type "mypascal" when "pascal" has been detected: >
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *		if &ft == 'pascal' | set ft=mypascal
								       | endif

C. If your file type can be detected by the file name or extension.
   1. Create your user runtime directory.  You would normally use the first
      item of the 'runtimepath' option.  Example for Unix: >
	:!mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
<
   2. Create a file that contains autocommands to detect the file type.
      Example: >
	" my filetype file
	if exists("did_load_filetypes")
	  finish
	endif
	augroup filetypedetect
	  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.mine		setfiletype mine
	  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.xyz		setfiletype drawing
	augroup END
<
      Write this file as "filetype.vim" in your user runtime directory.  For
      example, for Unix: >
	:w ~/.config/nvim/filetype.vim

<   3. To use the new filetype detection you must restart Vim.

   Your filetype.vim will be sourced before the default FileType autocommands
   have been installed.  Your autocommands will match first, and the
   ":setfiletype" command will make sure that no other autocommands will set
   'filetype' after this.
							*new-filetype-scripts*
D. If your filetype can only be detected by inspecting the contents of the
   file.

   1. Create your user runtime directory.  You would normally use the first
      item of the 'runtimepath' option.  Example for Unix: >
	:!mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
<
   2. Create a Vim script file for doing this.  Example: >
	if did_filetype()	" filetype already set..
	  finish		" ..don't do these checks
	endif
	if getline(1) =~ '^#!.*\<mine\>'
	  setfiletype mine
	elseif getline(1) =~? '\<drawing\>'
	  setfiletype drawing
	endif
<     See $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim for more examples.
      Write this file as "scripts.vim" in your user runtime directory.  For
      example, for Unix: >
	:w ~/.config/nvim/scripts.vim
<
   3. The detection will work right away, no need to restart Vim.

   Your scripts.vim is loaded before the default checks for file types, which
   means that your rules override the default rules in
   $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim.

							*remove-filetype*
If a file type is detected that is wrong for you, you can set 'filetype' to
a non-existing name such as `ignored` to avoid that it will be set later anyway.

						     *g:did_load_filetypes*
The builtin filetype detection provided by Nvim can be disabled by setting
the `did_load_filetypes` global variable. If this variable exists, the default
`$VIMRUNTIME/filetype.lua` will not run.

							*plugin-details*
The "plugin" directory can be in any of the directories in the 'runtimepath'
option.  All of these directories will be searched for plugins and they are
all loaded.  For example, if this command: >

	set runtimepath

produces this output:

	runtimepath=/etc/vim,~/.config/nvim,/usr/local/share/vim/vim82 ~

then Vim will load all plugins in these directories and below:

	/etc/vim/plugin/  ~
	~/.config/nvim/plugin/  ~
	/usr/local/share/vim/vim82/plugin/  ~

Note that the last one is the value of $VIMRUNTIME which has been expanded.

Note that when using a plugin manager or |packages| many directories will be
added to 'runtimepath'.  These plugins each require their own directory, don't
put them directly in ~/.config/nvim/plugin.

What if it looks like your plugin is not being loaded?  You can find out what
happens when Vim starts up by using the |-V| argument: >

	vim -V2

You will see a lot of messages, in between them is a remark about loading the
plugins.  It starts with:

	Searching for "plugin/**/*.vim" in ~

There you can see where Vim looks for your plugin scripts.

==============================================================================
2. Filetype plugin					*filetype-plugins*

When loading filetype plugins has been enabled |:filetype-plugin-on|, options
will be set and mappings defined.  These are all local to the buffer, they
will not be used for other files.

Defining mappings for a filetype may get in the way of the mappings you
define yourself.  There are a few ways to avoid this:
1. Set the "maplocalleader" variable to the key sequence you want the mappings
   to start with.  Example: >
	:let maplocalleader = ","
<  All mappings will then start with a comma instead of the default, which
   is a backslash.  Also see |<LocalLeader>|.

2. Define your own mapping.  Example: >
	:map ,p <Plug>MailQuote
<  You need to check the description of the plugin file below for the
   functionality it offers and the string to map to.
   You need to define your own mapping before the plugin is loaded (before
   editing a file of that type).  The plugin will then skip installing the
   default mapping.
					*no_mail_maps* *g:no_mail_maps*
3. Disable defining mappings for a specific filetype by setting a variable,
   which contains the name of the filetype.  For the "mail" filetype this
   would be: >
	:let no_mail_maps = 1
<					*no_plugin_maps* *g:no_plugin_maps*
4. Disable defining mappings for all filetypes by setting a variable: >
	:let no_plugin_maps = 1
<

							*ftplugin-overrule*
If a global filetype plugin does not do exactly what you want, there are three
ways to change this:

1. Add a few settings.
   You must create a new filetype plugin in a directory early in
   'runtimepath'.  For Unix, for example you could use this file: >
	vim ~/.config/nvim/ftplugin/fortran.vim
<   You can set those settings and mappings that you would like to add.  Note
   that the global plugin will be loaded after this, it may overrule the
   settings that you do here.  If this is the case, you need to use one of the
   following two methods.

2. Make a copy of the plugin and change it.
   You must put the copy in a directory early in 'runtimepath'.  For Unix, for
   example, you could do this: >
	cp $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/fortran.vim ~/.config/nvim/ftplugin/fortran.vim
<   Then you can edit the copied file to your liking.  Since the b:did_ftplugin
   variable will be set, the global plugin will not be loaded.
   A disadvantage of this method is that when the distributed plugin gets
   improved, you will have to copy and modify it again.

3. Overrule the settings after loading the global plugin.
   You must create a new filetype plugin in a directory from the end of
   'runtimepath'.  For Unix, for example, you could use this file: >
	vim ~/.config/nvim/after/ftplugin/fortran.vim
<   In this file you can change just those settings that you want to change.

==============================================================================
3.  Docs for the default filetype plugins.		*ftplugin-docs*


					*plugin_exec* *g:plugin_exec*
Enable executing of external commands.  This was done historically for e.g.
the perl filetype plugin (and a few others) to set the search path.
Disabled by default for security reasons: >
	:let g:plugin_exec = 1
It is also possible to enable this only for certain filetypes: >
	:let g:<filetype>_exec = 1
So to enable this only for ruby, set the following variable: >
	:let g:ruby_exec = 1

If both, the global `plugin_exec` and the `<filetype>_exec` specific variable
are set, the filetype specific variable should have precedent.


ASCIIDOC						*ft-asciidoc-plugin*

To enable |folding| use this: >
	let g:asciidoc_folding = 1

To disable nesting of folded headers use this: >
	let g:asciidoc_foldnested = 0

To disable folding everything under the title use this: >
	let asciidoc_fold_under_title = 0


ARDUINO							*ft-arduino-plugin*

By default the following options are set, in accordance with the default
settings of Arduino IDE: >

	setlocal expandtab tabstop=2 softtabstop=2 shiftwidth=2

To disable this behavior, set the following variable in your vimrc: >

	let g:arduino_recommended_style = 0


AWK							*ft-awk-plugin*

Support for features specific to GNU Awk, like @include, can be enabled by
setting: >
	:let g:awk_is_gawk = 1


CHANGELOG						*ft-changelog-plugin*

Allows for easy entrance of Changelog entries in Changelog files.  There are
some commands, mappings, and variables worth exploring:

Options:
'comments'		is made empty to not mess up formatting.
'textwidth'		is set to 78, which is standard.
'formatoptions'		the 't' flag is added to wrap when inserting text.

Commands:
NewChangelogEntry	Adds a new Changelog entry in an intelligent fashion
			(see below).

Local mappings:
<Leader>o		Starts a new Changelog entry in an equally intelligent
			fashion (see below).

Global mappings:
			NOTE: The global mappings are accessed by sourcing the
			ftplugin/changelog.vim file first, e.g. with >
				runtime ftplugin/changelog.vim
<			in your |init.vim|.
<Leader>o		Switches to the ChangeLog buffer opened for the
			current directory, or opens it in a new buffer if it
			exists in the current directory.  Then it does the
			same as the local <Leader>o described above.

Variables:
g:changelog_timeformat  Deprecated; use g:changelog_dateformat instead.
g:changelog_dateformat	The date (and time) format used in ChangeLog entries.
			The format accepted is the same as for the
			|strftime()| function.
			The default is "%Y-%m-%d" which is the standard format
			for many ChangeLog layouts.
g:changelog_username	The name and email address of the user.
			The default is deduced from environment variables and
			system files.  It searches /etc/passwd for the comment
			part of the current user, which informally contains
			the real name of the user up to the first separating
			comma.  then it checks the $NAME environment variable
			and finally runs `whoami` and `hostname` to build an
			email address.  The final form is >
				Full Name  <user@host>
<
g:changelog_new_date_format
			The format to use when creating a new date-entry.
			The following table describes special tokens in the
			string:
				%%	insert a single '%' character
				%d	insert the date from above
				%u	insert the user from above
				%p	insert result of b:changelog_entry_prefix
				%c	where to position cursor when done
			The default is "%d  %u\n\n\t* %p%c\n\n", which produces
			something like (| is where cursor will be, unless at
			the start of the line where it denotes the beginning
			of the line) >
				|2003-01-14  Full Name  <user@host>
				|
				|        * prefix|
<
g:changelog_new_entry_format
			The format used when creating a new entry.
			The following table describes special tokens in the
			string:
				%p	insert result of b:changelog_entry_prefix
				%c	where to position cursor when done
			The default is "\t*%c", which produces something
			similar to >
				|        * prefix|
<
g:changelog_date_entry_search
			The search pattern to use when searching for a
			date-entry.
			The same tokens that can be used for
			g:changelog_new_date_format can be used here as well.
			The default is '^\s*%d\_s*%u' which finds lines
			matching the form >
				|2003-01-14  Full Name  <user@host>
<			and some similar formats.

g:changelog_date_end_entry_search
			The search pattern to use when searching for the end
			of a date-entry.
			The same tokens that can be used for
			g:changelog_new_date_format can be used here as well.
			The default is '^\s*$' which finds lines that contain
			only whitespace or are completely empty.

b:changelog_name					*b:changelog_name*
			Name of the ChangeLog file to look for.
			The default is 'ChangeLog'.

b:changelog_path
			Path of the ChangeLog to use for the current buffer.
			The default is empty, thus looking for a file named
			|b:changelog_name| in the same directory as the
			current buffer.  If not found, the parent directory of
			the current buffer is searched.  This continues
			recursively until a file is found or there are no more
			parent directories to search.

b:changelog_entry_prefix
			Name of a function to call to generate a prefix to a
			new entry.  This function takes no arguments and
			should return a string containing the prefix.
			Returning an empty prefix is fine.
			The default generates the shortest path between the
			ChangeLog's pathname and the current buffers pathname.
			In the future, it will also be possible to use other
			variable contexts for this variable, for example, g:.

The Changelog entries are inserted where they add the least amount of text.
After figuring out the current date and user, the file is searched for an
entry beginning with the current date and user and if found adds another item
under it.  If not found, a new entry and item is prepended to the beginning of
the Changelog.


FORTRAN							*ft-fortran-plugin*

Options:
'expandtab'	is switched on to avoid tabs as required by the Fortran
		standards unless the user has set fortran_have_tabs in vimrc.
'textwidth'	is set to 80 for fixed source format whereas it is set to 132
		for free source format. Setting the fortran_extended_line_length
		variable increases the width to 132 for fixed source format.
'formatoptions' is set to break code and comment lines and to preserve long
		lines.  You can format comments with |gq|.
For further discussion of fortran_have_tabs and the method used for the
detection of source format see |ft-fortran-syntax|.


FREEBASIC						*ft-freebasic-plugin*

This plugin aims to treat the four FreeBASIC dialects, "fb", "qb", "fblite"
and "deprecated", as distinct languages.

The dialect will be set to the first name found in g:freebasic_forcelang, any
#lang directive or $lang metacommand in the file being edited, or finally
g:freebasic_lang.  These global variables conceptually map to the fbc options
-forcelang and -lang.  If no dialect is explicitly specified "fb" will be
used.

For example, to set the dialect to a default of "fblite" but still allow for
any #lang directive overrides, use the following command: >

	let g:freebasic_lang = "fblite"


GDSCRIPT						*ft-gdscript-plugin*

By default the following options are set, based on Godot official docs: >

	setlocal noexpandtab softtabstop=0 shiftwidth=0

To disable this behavior, set the following variable in your vimrc: >

	let g:gdscript_recommended_style = 0


GIT COMMIT						*ft-gitcommit-plugin*

One command, :DiffGitCached, is provided to show a diff of the current commit
in the preview window.  It is equivalent to calling "git diff --cached" plus
any arguments given to the command.

GIT REBASE						*ft-gitrebase-plugin*

The gitrebase filetype defines the following buffer-local commands, to help
with interactive `git rebase`: >

	:Drop   " to discard this commit
	:Edit   " to stop for editing this commit
	:Fixup  " to squash (but discard the message) into the previous one
	:Pick   " to pick this commit (the cursor is on)
	:Reword " to pick this commit, but change the commit message
	:Squash " to squash this commit into the previous one

In addition, the following command can be used to cycle between the different
possibilities: >

	:Cycle  " to cycle between the previous commands
<
The `:Cycle` command is also mapped to the CTRL-A and CTRL-X keys.
For details, see `git-rebase --help`.

GLEAM						*ft-gleam-plugin*

By default the following options are set for the recommended gleam style: >

	setlocal expandtab shiftwidth=2 softtabstop=2

To disable this behavior, set the following variable in your vimrc: >

	let g:gleam_recommended_style = 0

GO							*ft-go-plugin*

By default the following options are set, based on Golang official docs: >

	setlocal noexpandtab softtabstop=0 shiftwidth=0

To disable this behavior, set the following variable in your vimrc: >

	let g:go_recommended_style = 0


GPROF							*ft-gprof-plugin*

The gprof filetype plugin defines a mapping <C-]> to jump from a function
entry in the gprof flat profile or from a function entry in the call graph
to the details of that function in the call graph.

The mapping can be disabled with: >
	let g:no_gprof_maps = 1


HARE							*ft-hare*

Since the text for this plugin is rather long it has been put in a separate
file: |ft_hare.txt|.

HTML							*ft-html-plugin*

Tag folding poses a few difficulties.  Many elements, e.g. `blockquote`, are
always delimited by start and end tags; end tags for some elements, e.g. `p`,
can be omitted in certain contexts; void elements, e.g. `hr`, have no end tag.
Although the rules for supporting omissible end tags are ad-hoc and involved
[0], they apply to elements in scope.  Assuming syntactical wellformedness, an
end tag can be associated with its nearest matching start tag discoverable in
scope [1] and towards the beginning of a file, whereas all unbalanced tags and
inlined tags can be disregarded.  Having syntax highlighting in effect, tag
folding using the |fold-expr| method can be enabled with: >
	let g:html_expr_folding = 1
<
By default, tag folding will be redone from scratch after each occurrence of
a |TextChanged| or an |InsertLeave| event.  Such frequency may not be desired,
especially for large files, and this recomputation can be disabled with: >
	let g:html_expr_folding_without_recomputation = 1
        doautocmd FileType
<
To force another recomputation, do: >
	unlet! b:foldsmap

IDRIS2							*ft-idris2-plugin*

By default the following options are set: >

	setlocal shiftwidth=2 tabstop=2 expandtab
	setlocal comments=s1:{-,mb:-,ex:-},:\|\|\|,:--
	setlocal commentstring=--\ %s
	setlocal wildignore+=*.ibc

To use tabs instead of spaces for indentation, set the following variable
in your vimrc: >

	let g:idris2#allow_tabchar = 1

JAVA							*ft-java-plugin*

Whenever the variable "g:ftplugin_java_source_path" is defined and its value
is a filename whose extension is either ".jar" or ".zip", e.g.: >
	let g:ftplugin_java_source_path = '/path/to/src.jar'
	let g:ftplugin_java_source_path = '/path/to/src.zip'
<
and the |zip| plugin has already been sourced, the |gf| command can be used to
open the archive and the |n| command can be used to look for the selected type
and the <Return> key can be used to load a listed file.

Note that the effect of using the "gf" command WITHIN a buffer loaded with the
Zip plugin depends on the version of the Zip plugin.  For the Zip plugin
versions that do not support Jar type archives, consider creating symbolic
links with the ".zip" extension for each Jar archive of interest and assigning
any such file to the variable from now on.

Otherwise, for the defined variable "g:ftplugin_java_source_path", the local
value of the 'path' option will be further modified by prefixing the value of
the variable, e.g.: >
	let g:ftplugin_java_source_path = $JDK_SRC_PATH
	let &l:path = g:ftplugin_java_source_path . ',' . &l:path
<
and the "gf" command can be used on a fully-qualified type to look for a file
in the "path" and to try to load it.

Remember to manually trigger the |FileType| event from a buffer with a Java
file loaded in it each time after assigning a new value to the variable: >
	doautocmd FileType
<
Markdown documentation comments may contain common runs of vertical leading
whitespace following the comment marks (`///`) for aesthetic reasons; however,
some horizontal runs of leading whitespace are significant in Markdown because
they denote code blocks etc.  For convenience, a 'formatexpr' function is
provided for the |gq| operator.  As long as neither "g:java_ignore_javadoc"
nor "g:java_ignore_markdown" is defined, the reformatting of Markdown comments
can be enabled on demand with: >
	setlocal formatexpr=g:javaformat#RemoveCommonMarkdownWhitespace()
<
Or for Vim versions less than `7.4.265`, with: >
	setlocal formatexpr=javaformat#RemoveCommonMarkdownWhitespace()
<
This function accepts a range of lines, removes a common run of vertical
leading whitespace, and rewrites the lines of the range.  Depending on the
author's layout style and the comment contents, which lines to select for
reformatting can vary from the whole comment to only some portion of it.
To enable the recognition of Markdown comments each time after removing
"g:java_ignore_markdown" or "g:java_ignore_javadoc", remember to manually
re-source "javaformat.vim" for Vim versions greater than `8.2.1397`: >
	runtime autoload/javaformat.vim
<
LUA							*ft-lua-plugin*

					*g:lua_version* *g:lua_subversion*
Lua filetype's 'includeexpr' and |ft-lua-syntax| highlighting use the global
variables "g:lua_version" and "g:lua_subversion" to determine the version of
Lua to use (5.3 is the default)

For example, to use Lua 5.1, set the variables like this: >

	let g:lua_version = 5
	let g:lua_subversion = 1
<
MAIL							*ft-mail-plugin*

Options:
'modeline'	is switched off to avoid the danger of trojan horses, and to
		avoid that a Subject line with "Vim:" in it will cause an
		error message.
'textwidth'	is set to 72.  This is often recommended for e-mail.
'formatoptions'	is set to break text lines and to repeat the comment leader
		in new lines, so that a leading ">" for quotes is repeated.
		You can also format quoted text with |gq|.

Local mappings:
<LocalLeader>q   or   \MailQuote
	Quotes the text selected in Visual mode, or from the cursor position
	to the end of the file in Normal mode.  This means "> " is inserted in
	each line.

MAN					*ft-man-plugin* *:Man* *man.lua*

View manpages in Nvim. Supports highlighting, completion, locales, and
navigation. Also see |find-manpage|.

man.lua will always attempt to reuse the closest man window (above/left) but
otherwise create a split.

The case sensitivity of completion is controlled by 'fileignorecase'.

Commands:
Man {name}                Display the manpage for {name}.
Man {sect} {name}         Display the manpage for {name} and section {sect}.
Man {name}({sect})        Same as above.
Man {sect} {name}({sect}) Used during completion to show the real section of
                          when the provided section is a prefix, e.g. 1m vs 1.
Man {path}                Open the manpage at {path}. Prepend "./" if {path}
                          is relative to the current directory.
Man                       Open the manpage for the <cWORD> (man buffers)
                          or <cword> (non-man buffers) under the cursor.
Man!                      Display the current buffer contents as a manpage.

|:Man| accepts command modifiers. For example, to use a vertical split: >vim
    :vertical Man printf
To reuse the current window: >vim
    :hide Man printf

Local mappings:
K or CTRL-]               Jump to the manpage for the <cWORD> under the
                          cursor. Takes a count for the section.
CTRL-T                    Jump back to the location that the manpage was
                          opened from.
gO                        Show the manpage outline. |gO|
q                         :quit if invoked as $MANPAGER, otherwise :close.

Variables:
*g:no_man_maps*             Do not create mappings in manpage buffers.
*g:ft_man_folding_enable*   Fold manpages with foldmethod=indent foldnestmax=1.
*b:man_default_sects*       Comma-separated, ordered list of preferred sections.
                          For example in C one usually wants section 3 or 2: >
                               :let b:man_default_sections = '3,2'
*g:man_hardwrap*            Hard-wrap to $MANWIDTH or window width if $MANWIDTH is
                          empty or larger than the window width. Enabled by
                          default. Set |FALSE| to enable soft wrapping.

To use Nvim as a manpager: >bash
    export MANPAGER='nvim +Man!'

Note: when running `man` from the shell with Nvim as `$MANPAGER`, `man` will
pre-format the manpage using `groff`, and Nvim will display the manual page as
it was received from stdin (it can't "undo" the hard-wrap caused by
man/groff). To prevent man/groff from hard-wrapping the manpage, you can set
`$MANWIDTH=999` in your environment.

To disable bold highlighting: >vim
    :highlight link manBold Normal

Troubleshooting:

If you see an error like: >
    fuse: mount failed: Permission denied
this may be caused by AppArmor sandboxing. To fix this, add a local override
in e.g. `/etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.bin.man`: >bash
    mount fstype=fuse.nvim options=(ro, nosuid, nodev) -> /tmp/**,
    /usr/bin/fusermount Ux,

MARKDOWN						*ft-markdown-plugin*

To enable folding use this: >
	let g:markdown_folding = 1

'expandtab' will be set by default.  If you do not want that use this: >
	let g:markdown_recommended_style = 0


ORG							*ft-org-plugin*

To enable folding use this: >
	let g:org_folding = 1
<

PDF							*ft-pdf-plugin*

Two maps, <C-]> and <C-T>, are provided to simulate a tag stack for navigating
the PDF.  The following are treated as tags:

- The byte offset after "startxref" to the xref table
- The byte offset after the /Prev key in the trailer to an earlier xref table
- A line of the form "0123456789 00000 n" in the xref table
- An object reference like "1 0 R" anywhere in the PDF

These maps can be disabled with >
	:let g:no_pdf_maps = 1

PLSQL							*ft-plsql-plugin*

To enable syntax folding in PL/SQL filetypes, set the following variable: >

	:let g:plsql_fold = 1
<

PYTHON						*ft-python-plugin* *PEP8*

By default the following options are set, in accordance with PEP8: >

	setlocal expandtab shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4 tabstop=8

To disable this behavior, set the following variable in your vimrc: >

	let g:python_recommended_style = 0

QUERY					                *ft-query-plugin*


Linting of treesitter queries for installed parsers using
|vim.treesitter.query.lint()| is enabled by default on `BufEnter` and
`BufWrite`. To change the events that trigger linting, use >lua

	vim.g.query_lint_on = { 'InsertLeave', 'TextChanged' }
<
To disable linting completely, set >lua

	vim.g.query_lint_on = {}
<

QF QUICKFIX					    *qf.vim* *ft-qf-plugin*

The "qf" filetype is used for the quickfix window, see |quickfix-window|.

The quickfix filetype plugin includes configuration for displaying the command
that produced the quickfix list in the |status-line|. To disable this setting,
configure as follows: >
	:let g:qf_disable_statusline = 1


R MARKDOWN						*ft-rmd-plugin*

By default ftplugin/html.vim is not sourced. If you want it sourced, add to
your |vimrc|: >
	let rmd_include_html = 1

The 'formatexpr' option is set dynamically with different values for R code
and for Markdown code. If you prefer that 'formatexpr' is not set, add to your
|vimrc|: >
	let rmd_dynamic_comments = 0


R RESTRUCTURED TEXT					*ft-rrst-plugin*

The 'formatexpr' option is set dynamically with different values for R code
and for ReStructured text. If you prefer that 'formatexpr' is not set, add to
your |vimrc|: >
	let rrst_dynamic_comments = 0


RESTRUCTUREDTEXT					*ft-rst-plugin*

The following formatting setting are optionally available: >
	setlocal expandtab shiftwidth=3 softtabstop=3 tabstop=8

To enable this behavior, set the following variable in your vimrc: >
	let g:rst_style = 1


RNOWEB							*ft-rnoweb-plugin*

The 'formatexpr' option is set dynamically with different values for R code
and for LaTeX code. If you prefer that 'formatexpr' is not set, add to your
|vimrc|: >
	let rnw_dynamic_comments = 0


RPM SPEC						*ft-spec-plugin*

Since the text for this plugin is rather long it has been put in a separate
file: |pi_spec.txt|.


SHADA							*ft-shada*

Allows editing binary |shada-file|s in a nice way.  Opened binary files are
displayed in the following format: >

    Type with timestamp YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS:
      % Key__  Description___  Value
      + fooba  foo bar baz fo  {msgpack-value}
      + abcde  abc def ghi jk  {msgpack-value}
    Other type with timestamp YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS:
      @ Description__  Value
      - foo bar baz t  {msgpack-value}
      # Expected more elements in list
    Some other type with timestamp YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS:
      # Unexpected type: type instead of map
      = {msgpack-value}

Filetype plugin defines all |Cmd-event|s.  Defined |SourceCmd| event makes
"source file.shada" be equivalent to "|:rshada| file.shada".  |BufWriteCmd|,
|FileWriteCmd| and |FileAppendCmd| events are affected by the following
settings:

*g:shada#keep_old_header*	Boolean, if set to false all header entries
				are ignored when writing.  Defaults to 1.
*g:shada#add_own_header*	Boolean, if set to true first written entry
				will always be header entry with two values in
				a map with attached data: |v:version| attached
				to "version" key and "shada.vim" attached to
				"generator" key.  Defaults to 1.

Format description:

1. `#` starts a comment.  Lines starting with space characters and then `#`
   are ignored.  Plugin may only add comment lines to indicate some errors in
   ShaDa format.  Lines containing no non-whitespace characters are also
   ignored.
2. Each entry starts with line that has format "{type} with timestamp
   {timestamp}:". {timestamp} is |strftime()|-formatted string representing
   actual Unix timestamp value. First strftime() argument is equal to
   `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S`.  When writing this timestamp is parsed using
   |msgpack#strptime()|, with caching (it remembers which timestamp produced
   particular strftime() output and uses this value if you did not change
   timestamp). {type} is one of
    1 - Header
    2 - Search pattern
    3 - Replacement string
    4 - History entry
    5 - Register
    6 - Variable
    7 - Global mark
    8 - Jump
    9 - Buffer list
   10 - Local mark
   11 - Change
    * - Unknown (0x{type-hex})

   Each type may be represented using Unknown entry: "Jump with timestamp ..."
   is the same as "Unknown (0x8) with timestamp ....".
3. After header there is one of the following lines:
   1. "  % Key__  Description__  Value": map header.  After mapping header
      follows a table which may contain comments and lines consisting of
      "  +", key, description and |{msgpack-value}|.  Key is separated by at
      least two spaces with description, description is separated by at least
      two spaces with the value.  Each key in the map must be at most as wide
      as "Key__" header: "Key" allows at most 3-byte keys, "Key__" allows at
      most 5-byte keys.  If keys actually occupy less bytes then the rest is
      filled with spaces.  Keys cannot be empty, end with spaces, contain two
      consequent spaces inside of them or contain multibyte characters (use
      "=" format if you need this).  Descriptions have the same restrictions
      on width and contents, except that empty descriptions are allowed.
      Description column may be omitted.

      When writing description is ignored.  Keys with values |msgpack#equal|
      to default ones are ignored.  Order of keys is preserved.  All keys are
      treated as strings (not binary strings).

      Note: specifically for buffer list entries it is allowed to have more
      then one map header.  Each map header starts a new map entry inside
      buffer list because ShaDa buffer list entry is an array of maps.  I.e. >

        Buffer list with timestamp 1970-01-01T00:00:00:
          % Key  Description  Value
          + f    file name    "/foo"
          + l    line number  1
          + c    column       10
<
      is equivalent to >

        Buffer list with timestamp 1970-01-01T00:00:00:
          = [{="f": "/foo", ="c": 10}]
<
      and >

        Buffer list with timestamp 1970-01-01T00:00:00:
          % Key  Description  Value
          + f    file name    "/foo"

          % Key  Description  Value
          + f    file name    "/bar"
<
      is equivalent to >

        Buffer list with timestamp 1970-01-01T00:00:00:
          = [{="f": "/foo"}, {="f": "/bar"}]
<
      Note 2: specifically for register entries special syntax for arrays was
      designed: >

        Register with timestamp 1970-01-01T00:00:00:
          % Key  Description  Value
          + rc   contents     @
          | - "line1"
          | - "line2"
<
      This is equivalent to >

        Register with timestamp 1970-01-01T00:00:00:
          % Key  Description  Value
          + rc   contents     ["line1", "line2"]
<
      Such syntax is automatically used if array representation appears to be
      too lengthy.
   2. "  @  Description__  Value": array header.  Same as map, but key is
      omitted and description cannot be omitted.  Array entries start with
      "  -". Example: >

        History entry with timestamp 1970-01-01T00:00:00:
          @ Description_  Value
          - history type  SEARCH
          - contents      "foo"
          - separator     '/'
<
      is equivalent to >

        History entry with timestamp 1970-01-01T00:00:00:
          = [SEARCH, "foo", '/']
<
      Note: special array syntax for register entries is not recognized here.
   3. "  = {msgpack-value}": raw values.  |{msgpack-value}| in this case may
      have absolutely any type.  Special array syntax for register entries is
      not recognized here as well.


RUST							*ft-rust*

Since the text for this plugin is rather long it has been put in a separate
file: |ft_rust.txt|.


SQL							*ft-sql*

Since the text for this plugin is rather long it has been put in a separate
file: |ft_sql.txt|.


TEX						*ft-tex-plugin* *g:tex_flavor*

If the first line of a `*.tex` file has the form >
	%&<format>
then this determined the file type:  plaintex (for plain TeX), context (for
ConTeXt), or tex (for LaTeX).  Otherwise, the file is searched for keywords to
choose context or tex.  If no keywords are found, it defaults to plaintex.
You can change the default by defining the variable g:tex_flavor to the format
(not the file type) you use most.  Use one of these: >
	let g:tex_flavor = "plain"
	let g:tex_flavor = "context"
	let g:tex_flavor = "latex"
Currently no other formats are recognized.

TYPST							*ft-typst-plugin*

							*g:typst_conceal*
When |TRUE| the Typst filetype plugin will set the 'conceallevel' option to 2.

							*g:typst_folding*
When |TRUE| the Typst filetype plugin will fold headings. (default: |FALSE|)

To enable: >
	let g:typst_folding = 1
<
							*g:typst_foldnested*
When |TRUE| the Typst filetype plugin will fold nested heading under their
parents. (default: |TRUE|)

To disable: >
	let g:typst_foldnested = 0
<
VIM							*ft-vim-plugin*

The Vim filetype plugin defines mappings to move to the start and end of
functions with [[ and ]].  Move around comments with ]" and [".

The mappings can be disabled with: >
	let g:no_vim_maps = 1

YAML							*ft-yaml-plugin*
By default, the YAML filetype plugin enables the following options: >
	setlocal shiftwidth=2 softtabstop=2

To disable this, set the following variable: >
	let g:yaml_recommended_style = 0


ZIG							*ft-zig-plugin*

						*g:zig_recommended_style*
By default the following indentation options are set, in accordance with Zig's
recommended style (https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/): >

	setlocal expandtab shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4 tabstop=8
<
To disable this behavior, set |g:zig_recommended_style| to 0: >

	let g:zig_recommended_style = 0
<
							*g:zig_std_dir*
The path to the Zig standard library. The Zig |ftplugin| reads |g:zig_std_dir|
and appends it to the 'path' for Zig files. Where the Zig standard library
is located is system and installation method dependent.

One can automatically set |g:zig_std_dir| using `zig env`: >

	let g:zig_std_dir = json_decode(system('zig env'))['std_dir']
<
This can, for example, be put in a FileType |:autocmd| or user |ftplugin| to
only load when a Zig file is opened.


ZIMBU							*ft-zimbu-plugin*

The Zimbu filetype plugin defines mappings to move to the start and end of
functions with [[ and ]].

The mappings can be disabled with: >
	let g:no_zimbu_maps = 1
<
