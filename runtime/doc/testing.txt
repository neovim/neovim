Testing Vim and Vim script			*testing-support*

Expression evaluation is explained in |eval.txt|.  This file goes into details
about writing tests in Vim script.  This can be used for testing Vim itself
and for testing plugins.

1. Testing Vim				|testing|
2. Test functions			|test-functions-details|
3. Assert functions			|assert-functions-details|

==============================================================================
1. Testing Vim						*testing*

Vim can be tested after building it, usually with "make test".
The tests are located in the directory "src/testdir".

There are several types of tests added over time:
	test33.in		oldest, don't add any of these
	test_something.in	old style tests
	test_something.vim	new style tests

						*new-style-testing*
New tests should be added as new style tests.  These use functions such as
|assert_equal()| to keep the test commands and the expected result in one
place.
						*old-style-testing*
In some cases an old style test needs to be used.

Find more information in the file src/testdir/README.txt.

==============================================================================
2. Test functions				*test-functions-details*

test_garbagecollect_now()			 *test_garbagecollect_now()*
		Like garbagecollect(), but executed right away.  This must
		only be called directly to avoid any structure to exist
		internally, and |v:testing| must have been set before calling
		any function.

==============================================================================
3. Assert functions				*assert-functions-details*


assert_beeps({cmd})					*assert_beeps()*
		Run {cmd} and add an error message to |v:errors| if it does
		NOT produce a beep or visual bell.
		Also see |assert_fails()|, |assert_nobeep()| and
		|assert-return|.

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			GetCmd()->assert_beeps()
<
							*assert_equal()*
assert_equal({expected}, {actual} [, {msg}])
		When {expected} and {actual} are not equal an error message is
		added to |v:errors| and 1 is returned.  Otherwise zero is
		returned |assert-return|.
		There is no automatic conversion, the String "4" is different
		from the Number 4.  And the number 4 is different from the
		Float 4.0.  The value of 'ignorecase' is not used here, case
		always matters.
		When {msg} is omitted an error in the form "Expected
		{expected} but got {actual}" is produced.
		Example: >
	assert_equal('foo', 'bar')
<		Will result in a string to be added to |v:errors|:
	test.vim line 12: Expected 'foo' but got 'bar' ~

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			mylist->assert_equal([1, 2, 3])

<							*assert_equalfile()*
assert_equalfile({fname-one}, {fname-two})
		When the files {fname-one} and {fname-two} do not contain
		exactly the same text an error message is added to |v:errors|.
		Also see |assert-return|.
		When {fname-one} or {fname-two} does not exist the error will
		mention that.

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			GetLog()->assert_equalfile('expected.log')

assert_exception({error} [, {msg}])			*assert_exception()*
		When v:exception does not contain the string {error} an error
		message is added to |v:errors|.  Also see |assert-return|.
		This can be used to assert that a command throws an exception.
		Using the error number, followed by a colon, avoids problems
		with translations: >
			try
			  commandthatfails
			  call assert_false(1, 'command should have failed')
			catch
			  call assert_exception('E492:')
			endtry

assert_fails({cmd} [, {error} [, {msg}]])			*assert_fails()*
		Run {cmd} and add an error message to |v:errors| if it does
		NOT produce an error.  Also see |assert-return|.
		When {error} is given it must match in |v:errmsg|.
		Note that beeping is not considered an error, and some failing
		commands only beep.  Use |assert_beeps()| for those.

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			GetCmd()->assert_fails('E99:')

assert_false({actual} [, {msg}])				*assert_false()*
		When {actual} is not false an error message is added to
		|v:errors|, like with |assert_equal()|.
		Also see |assert-return|.
		A value is false when it is zero. When {actual} is not a
		number the assert fails.
		When {msg} is omitted an error in the form
		"Expected False but got {actual}" is produced.

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			GetResult()->assert_false()

assert_inrange({lower}, {upper}, {actual} [, {msg}])	 *assert_inrange()*
		This asserts number and |Float| values.  When {actual}  is lower
		than {lower} or higher than {upper} an error message is added
		to |v:errors|.  Also see |assert-return|.
		When {msg} is omitted an error in the form
		"Expected range {lower} - {upper}, but got {actual}" is
		produced.

								*assert_match()*
assert_match({pattern}, {actual} [, {msg}])
		When {pattern} does not match {actual} an error message is
		added to |v:errors|.  Also see |assert-return|.

		{pattern} is used as with |=~|: The matching is always done
		like 'magic' was set and 'cpoptions' is empty, no matter what
		the actual value of 'magic' or 'cpoptions' is.

		{actual} is used as a string, automatic conversion applies.
		Use "^" and "$" to match with the start and end of the text.
		Use both to match the whole text.

		When {msg} is omitted an error in the form
		"Pattern {pattern} does not match {actual}" is produced.
		Example: >
	assert_match('^f.*o$', 'foobar')
<		Will result in a string to be added to |v:errors|:
	test.vim line 12: Pattern '^f.*o$' does not match 'foobar' ~

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			getFile()->assert_match('foo.*')
<
assert_nobeep({cmd})					*assert_nobeep()*
		Run {cmd} and add an error message to |v:errors| if it
		produces a beep or visual bell.
		Also see |assert_beeps()|.

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			GetCmd()->assert_nobeep()
<
							*assert_notequal()*
assert_notequal({expected}, {actual} [, {msg}])
		The opposite of `assert_equal()`: add an error message to
		|v:errors| when {expected} and {actual} are equal.
		Also see |assert-return|.

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			mylist->assert_notequal([1, 2, 3])

<							*assert_notmatch()*
assert_notmatch({pattern}, {actual} [, {msg}])
		The opposite of `assert_match()`: add an error message to
		|v:errors| when {pattern} matches {actual}.
		Also see |assert-return|.

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			getFile()->assert_notmatch('bar.*')


assert_report({msg})					*assert_report()*
		Report a test failure directly, using String {msg}.
		Always returns one.

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			GetMessage()->assert_report()


assert_true({actual} [, {msg}])				*assert_true()*
		When {actual} is not true an error message is added to
		|v:errors|, like with |assert_equal()|.
		Also see |assert-return|.
		A value is |TRUE| when it is a non-zero number or |v:true|.
		When {actual} is not a number or |v:true| the assert fails.
		When {msg} is omitted an error in the form "Expected True but
		got {actual}" is produced.

		Can also be used as a |method|: >
			GetResult()->assert_true()
