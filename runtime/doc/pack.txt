Using Vim packages                                      *packages*

A Vim "package" is a directory that contains |plugin|s.  Compared to normal
plugins, a package can...
- be downloaded as an archive and unpacked in its own directory, so the files
  are not mixed with files of other plugins.
- be a git, mercurial, etc. repository, thus easy to update.
- contain multiple plugins that depend on each other.
- contain plugins that are automatically loaded on startup ("start" packages,
  located in "pack/*/start/*") and ones that are only loaded when needed with
  |:packadd| ("opt" packages, located in "pack/*/opt/*").

                                                        *runtime-search-path*
Nvim searches for |:runtime| files in:
- 1. all paths in 'runtimepath'
- 2. all "pack/*/start/*" dirs

Note that the "pack/*/start/*" paths are not explicitly included in
'runtimepath', so they will not be reported by ":set rtp" or "echo &rtp".
Scripts can use |nvim_list_runtime_paths()| to list all used directories, and
|nvim_get_runtime_file()| to query for specific files or sub-folders within
the runtime path. Example: >
    " List all runtime dirs and packages with Lua paths.
    :echo nvim_get_runtime_file("lua/", v:true)

Using a package and loading automatically ~

Let's assume your Nvim files are in "~/.local/share/nvim/site" and you want to
add a package from a zip archive "/tmp/foopack.zip": >
    % mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo
    % cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo
    % unzip /tmp/foopack.zip

The directory name "foo" is arbitrary, you can pick anything you like.

You would now have these files under ~/.local/share/nvim/site: >
    pack/foo/README.txt
    pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim
    pack/foo/start/foobar/syntax/some.vim
    pack/foo/opt/foodebug/plugin/debugger.vim

On startup after processing your |config|, Nvim scans all directories in
'packpath' for plugins in "pack/*/start/*", then loads the plugins.

To allow for calling into package functionality while parsing your |vimrc|,
|:colorscheme| and |autoload| will both automatically search under 'packpath'
as well in addition to 'runtimepath'.  See the documentation for each for
details.

In the example Nvim will find "pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim" and load
it.

If the "foobar" plugin kicks in and sets the 'filetype' to "some", Nvim will
find the syntax/some.vim file, because its directory is in the runtime search
path.

Nvim will also load ftdetect files, if there are any.

Note that the files under "pack/foo/opt" are not loaded automatically, only the
ones under "pack/foo/start".  See |pack-add| below for how the "opt" directory
is used.

Loading packages automatically will not happen if loading plugins is disabled,
see |load-plugins|.

To load packages earlier, so that plugin/ files are sourced:
    :packloadall
This also works when loading plugins is disabled.  The automatic loading will
only happen once.

If the package has an "after" directory, that directory is added to the end of
'runtimepath', so that anything there will be loaded later.


Using a single plugin and loading it automatically ~

If you don't have a package but a single plugin, you need to create the extra
directory level: >
    % mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/start/foobar
    % cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/start/foobar
    % unzip /tmp/someplugin.zip

You would now have these files: >
    pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim
    pack/foo/start/foobar/syntax/some.vim

From here it works like above.


Optional plugins ~
                                                        *pack-add*
To load an optional plugin from a pack use the `:packadd` command: >
    :packadd foodebug
This searches for "pack/*/opt/foodebug" in 'packpath' and will find
~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/opt/foodebug/plugin/debugger.vim and source
it.

This could be done if some conditions are met.  For example, depending on
whether Nvim supports a feature or a dependency is missing.

You can also load an optional plugin at startup, by putting this command in
your |config|: >
    :packadd! foodebug
The extra "!" is so that the plugin isn't loaded if Nvim was started with
|--noplugin|.

It is perfectly normal for a package to only have files in the "opt"
directory.  You then need to load each plugin when you want to use it.


Where to put what ~

Since color schemes, loaded with `:colorscheme`, are found below
"pack/*/start" and "pack/*/opt", you could put them anywhere.  We recommend
you put them below "pack/*/opt", for example
"~/.config/nvim/pack/mycolors/opt/dark/colors/very_dark.vim".

Filetype plugins should go under "pack/*/start", so that they are always
found.  Unless you have more than one plugin for a file type and want to
select which one to load with `:packadd`.  E.g. depending on the compiler
version: >
    if foo_compiler_version > 34
      packadd foo_new
    else
      packadd foo_old
    endif

The "after" directory is most likely not useful in a package.  It's not
disallowed though.

==============================================================================
Creating Vim packages                                   *package-create*

This assumes you write one or more plugins that you distribute as a package.

If you have two unrelated plugins you would use two packages, so that Vim
users can choose what they include or not.  Or you can decide to use one
package with optional plugins, and tell the user to add the preferred ones with
`:packadd`.

Decide how you want to distribute the package.  You can create an archive or
you could use a repository.  An archive can be used by more users, but is a
bit harder to update to a new version.  A repository can usually be kept
up-to-date easily, but it requires a program like "git" to be available.
You can do both, github can automatically create an archive for a release.

Your directory layout would be like this: >
   start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim          " always loaded, defines commands
   start/foobar/plugin/bar.vim          " always loaded, defines commands
   start/foobar/autoload/foo.vim        " loaded when foo command used
   start/foobar/doc/foo.txt             " help for foo.vim
   start/foobar/doc/tags                " help tags
   opt/fooextra/plugin/extra.vim        " optional plugin, defines commands
   opt/fooextra/autoload/extra.vim      " loaded when extra command used
   opt/fooextra/doc/extra.txt           " help for extra.vim
   opt/fooextra/doc/tags                " help tags
<
This allows for the user to do: >
    mkdir ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack
    cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack
    git clone https://github.com/you/foobar.git myfoobar

Here "myfoobar" is a name that the user can choose, the only condition is that
it differs from other packages.

In your documentation you explain what the plugins do, and tell the user how
to load the optional plugin: >
    :packadd! fooextra

You could add this packadd command in one of your plugins, to be executed when
the optional plugin is needed.

Run the `:helptags` command to generate the doc/tags file.  Including this
generated file in the package means that the user can drop the package in the
pack directory and the help command works right away.  Don't forget to re-run
the command after changing the plugin help: >
    :helptags path/start/foobar/doc
    :helptags path/opt/fooextra/doc


Dependencies between plugins ~
                                                        *packload-two-steps*
Suppose you have two plugins that depend on the same functionality. You can
put the common functionality in an autoload directory, so that it will be
found automatically.  Your package would have these files:

pack/foo/start/one/plugin/one.vim  >
    call foolib#getit()
pack/foo/start/two/plugin/two.vim >
    call foolib#getit()
pack/foo/start/lib/autoload/foolib.vim >
    func foolib#getit()

This works, because start packages will be searched for autoload files, when
sourcing the plugins.

Plugin manager                                                      *vim.pack*

WORK IN PROGRESS built-in plugin manager! Early testing of existing features
is appreciated, but expect breaking changes without notice.

Manages plugins only in a dedicated *vim.pack-directory* (see |packages|):
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site/pack/core/opt`. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site` needs to
be part of 'packpath'. It usually is, but might not be in cases like |--clean|
or setting |$XDG_DATA_HOME| during startup. Plugin's subdirectory name matches
plugin's name in specification. It is assumed that all plugins in the
directory are managed exclusively by `vim.pack`.

Uses Git to manage plugins and requires present `git` executable of at least
version 2.36. Target plugins should be Git repositories with versions as named
tags following semver convention `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.

The latest state of all managed plugins is stored inside a *vim.pack-lockfile*
located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/nvim-pack-lock.json`. It is a JSON file that
is used to persistently track data about plugins. For a more robust config
treat lockfile like its part: put under version control, etc. Should not be
edited by hand or deleted.

Example workflows ~

Basic install and management:
• Add |vim.pack.add()| call(s) to 'init.lua': >lua

    vim.pack.add({
      -- Install "plugin1" and use default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
      'https://github.com/user/plugin1',

      -- Same as above, but using a table (allows setting other options)
      { src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin1' },

      -- Specify plugin's name (here the plugin will be called "plugin2"
      -- instead of "generic-name")
      { src = 'https://github.com/user/generic-name', name = 'plugin2' },

      -- Specify version to follow during install and update
      {
        src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin3',
        -- Version constraint, see |vim.version.range()|
        version = vim.version.range('1.0'),
      },
      {
        src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin4',
        -- Git branch, tag, or commit hash
        version = 'main',
      },
    })

    -- Plugin's code can be used directly after `add()`
    plugin1 = require('plugin1')
<
• Restart Nvim (for example, with |:restart|). Plugins that were not yet
  installed will be available on disk in target state after `add()` call.
• To update all plugins with new changes:
  • Execute |vim.pack.update()|. This will download updates from source and
    show confirmation buffer in a separate tabpage.
  • Review changes. To confirm all updates execute |:write|. To discard
    updates execute |:quit|.
  • (Optionally) |:restart| to start using code from updated plugins.

Switch plugin's version:
• Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have desired `version`. Let's say, plugin
  named 'plugin1' has changed to `vim.version.range('*')`.
• |:restart|. The plugin's actual state on disk is not yet changed. Only
  plugin's `version` in |vim.pack-lockfile| is updated.
• Execute `vim.pack.update({ 'plugin1' })`.
• Review changes and either confirm or discard them. If discarded, revert any
  changes in 'init.lua' as well or you will be prompted again next time you
  run |vim.pack.update()|.

Freeze plugin from being updated:
• Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have `version` set to current revision. Get
  it from |vim.pack-lockfile| (plugin's field `rev`; looks like `abc12345`).
• |:restart|.

Unfreeze plugin to start receiving updates:
• Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have `version` set to whichever version you
  want it to be updated.
• |:restart|.

Remove plugins from disk:
• Use |vim.pack.del()| with a list of plugin names to remove. Make sure their
  specs are not included in |vim.pack.add()| call in 'init.lua' or they will
  be reinstalled.

Available events to hook into ~
• *PackChangedPre* - before trying to change plugin's state.
• *PackChanged* - after plugin's state has changed.

Each event populates the following |event-data| fields:
• `kind` - one of "install" (install on disk), "update" (update existing
  plugin), "delete" (delete from disk).
• `spec` - plugin's specification with defaults made explicit.
• `path` - full path to plugin's directory.


*vim.pack.Spec*

    Fields: ~
      • {src}       (`string`) URI from which to install and pull updates. Any
                    format supported by `git clone` is allowed.
      • {name}?     (`string`) Name of plugin. Will be used as directory name.
                    Default: `src` repository name.
      • {version}?  (`string|vim.VersionRange`) Version to use for install and
                    updates. Can be:
                    • `nil` (no value, default) to use repository's default
                      branch (usually `main` or `master`).
                    • String to use specific branch, tag, or commit hash.
                    • Output of |vim.version.range()| to install the
                      greatest/last semver tag inside the version constraint.
      • {data}?     (`any`) Arbitrary data associated with a plugin.


add({specs}, {opts})                                          *vim.pack.add()*
    Add plugin to current session
    • For each specification check that plugin exists on disk in
      |vim.pack-directory|:
      • If exists, do nothing in this step.
      • If doesn't exist, install it by downloading from `src` into `name`
        subdirectory (via `git clone`) and update state to match `version`
        (via `git checkout`).
    • For each plugin execute |:packadd| (or customizable `load` function)
      making it reachable by Nvim.

    Notes:
    • Installation is done in parallel, but waits for all to finish before
      continuing next code execution.
    • If plugin is already present on disk, there are no checks about its
      present state. The specified `version` can be not the one actually
      present on disk. Execute |vim.pack.update()| to synchronize.
    • Adding plugin second and more times during single session does nothing:
      only the data from the first adding is registered.

    Parameters: ~
      • {specs}  (`(string|vim.pack.Spec)[]`) List of plugin specifications.
                 String item is treated as `src`.
      • {opts}   (`table?`) A table with the following fields:
                 • {load}?
                   (`boolean|fun(plug_data: {spec: vim.pack.Spec, path: string})`)
                   Load `plugin/` files and `ftdetect/` scripts. If `false`,
                   works like `:packadd!`. If function, called with plugin
                   data and is fully responsible for loading plugin. Default
                   `false` during startup and `true` afterwards.
                 • {confirm}? (`boolean`) Whether to ask user to confirm
                   initial install. Default `true`.

del({names})                                                  *vim.pack.del()*
    Remove plugins from disk

    Parameters: ~

get({names}, {opts})                                          *vim.pack.get()*
    Gets |vim.pack| plugin info, optionally filtered by `names`.

    Parameters: ~
      • {names}  (`string[]?`) List of plugin names. Default: all plugins

                   Default `true`.

    Return: ~
        (`table[]`) A list of objects with the following fields:
        • {active} (`boolean`) Whether plugin was added via |vim.pack.add()|
          to current session.
        • {branches}? (`string[]`) Available Git branches (first is default).
          Missing if `info=false`.
        • {path} (`string`) Plugin's path on disk.
        • {rev} (`string`) Current Git revision.
        • {spec} (`vim.pack.SpecResolved`) A |vim.pack.Spec| with resolved

    • Depending on `force`:
      • If `false`, show confirmation buffer. It lists data about all set to
        update plugins. Pending changes starting with `>` will be applied
        while the ones starting with `<` will be reverted. It has special
        in-process LSP server attached to provide more interactive features.
        Currently supported methods:
        • 'textDocument/documentSymbol' (`gO` via |lsp-defaults| or
          |vim.lsp.buf.document_symbol()|) - show structure of the buffer.
        • 'textDocument/hover' (`K` via |lsp-defaults| or
          |vim.lsp.buf.hover()|) - show more information at cursor. Like
          details of particular pending change or newer tag.
        Execute |:write| to confirm update, execute |:quit| to discard the
        update.
      • If `true`, make updates right away.

    Notes:
    • Every actual update is logged in "nvim-pack.log" file inside "log"
      |stdpath()|.
