==============================================================================
BREAKING CHANGES

These changes may require adaptations in your config or plugins.

• API:
  • |nvim_open_win()| now blocks all autocommands when `noautocmd` is set,
    rather than just those from setting the `buffer` to display in the window.

• Defaults:
  • Default color scheme has been updated to be "Nvim branded" and accessible.
    Use `:colorscheme vim` to revert to the old legacy color scheme.
    • These Nvim specific highlight groups are now defined in a meaningfully
      different way and might need an update:
      • |hl-FloatBorder| is linked to |hl-NormalFloat| instead of |hl-WinSeparator|.
      • |hl-NormalFloat| is not linked to |hl-Pmenu|.
      • |hl-WinBar| has different background.
      • |hl-WinBarNC| is similar to |hl-WinBar| but not bold.
      • |hl-WinSeparator| is linked to |hl-Normal| instead of |hl-VertSplit|.
    • This also might result into some color schemes looking differently due
      to them relying on implicit assumptions about how highlight groups are
      defined by default. To account for this, define all attributes of
      highlight groups explicitly. Alternatively, use `:colorscheme vim` or
      `:source $VIMRUNTIME/colors/vim.lua` to restore previous definitions.
  • 'termguicolors' is enabled by default when Nvim is able to determine that
    the host terminal emulator supports 24-bit color.

• Editor:
  • When switching windows, |CursorMoved| autocommands trigger when Nvim is
    back on the main loop rather than immediately. This is more compatible
    with Vim.
  • "#" followed by a digit no longer stands for a function key at the start
    of the lhs of a mapping.
  • |shm-q| now fully hides macro recording message instead of only shortening it.
  • Signs placed through the legacy |sign-commands| are now stored and
    displayed as |extmarks| internally. Along with the following changes:
    • A sign placed twice in the same group with the same identifier will be
      moved.
    • Legacy signs are always deleted along with the line it is placed on.
    • Legacy and extmark signs will show up in both |:sign-place-list| and
      |nvim_buf_get_extmarks()|.
    • Legacy and extmark signs are displayed and listed with the same priority:
        line number -> priority -> sign id -> recently placed
  • `:behave` was removed.
    • If you used `:behave xterm`, the following is equivalent: >vim

      set mousemodel=extend
<
    • If you used `:behave mswin`, the following is equivalent: >vim

      set selection=exclusive
      set selectmode=mouse,key
      set mousemodel=popup
      set keymodel=startsel,stopsel
<
• Events:
  • Returning any truthy value from a callback passed to
    |nvim_create_autocmd()| (rather than just `true`) will delete the
    autocommand.

• LSP:
  • |LanguageTree:parse()| will no longer parse injections by default and now
    requires an explicit range argument to be passed. If injections are
    required, provide an explicit range via `parser:parse({ start_row, end_row })`.
  • |vim.lsp.util.parse_snippet()| will now strictly follow the snippet
    grammar defined by LSP, and hence previously parsed snippets might now be
    considered invalid input.
  • |vim.lsp.codelens.refresh()| now takes an `opts` argument. With this
    change, the default behavior of just refreshing the current buffer has
    been replaced by refreshing all buffers.
  • |vim.lsp.util.extract_completion_items()| will no longer return reliable
    results, since it does not apply `itemDefaults` when its input is
    a `CompletionList`. Moreover, since support for LSP
    `completionList.itemDefaults` was added, some third party plugins might be
    negatively impacted in case the language servers support the feature but
    the plugin does not. If necessary, the respective capability can be
    removed when calling |vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()|.
  • |LspRequest| and LspProgressUpdate (renamed to |LspProgress|) autocmds
    were promoted from |User| autocmds to first class citizens.

• Lua:
  • |-l| ensures output ends with a newline if the script prints messages and
    doesn't cause Nvim to exit.
  • Removed functions from the |vim.json| module:
    • Unnecessary, undocumented functions which caused global side-effects.
    • `vim.json.null` is redundant with `vim.NIL`.
    • `vim.json.array_mt` (and related) is redundant with `vim.empty_dict()`.
  • |vim.islist()| now checks whether a table is actually list-like (i.e., has
    integer keys without gaps and starting from 1). For the previous behavior
    (only check for integer keys, allow gaps or not starting with 1), use
    |vim.isarray()|.
  • Renamed `vim.treesitter.playground` to `vim.treesitter.dev`.

• Options:
  • Removed some Vim 5.0<= option compatibilities:
    • 'backspace' no longer supports number values. Instead:
      • for `backspace=0` set `backspace=` (empty)
      • for `backspace=1` set `backspace=indent,eol`
      • for `backspace=2` set `backspace=indent,eol,start` (default behavior in Nvim)
      • for `backspace=3` set `backspace=indent,eol,nostop`
    • 'backupdir' and 'directory' will no longer remove a `>` at the start of
      the option.
  • |OptionSet| autocommand args |v:option_new|, |v:option_old|,
    |v:option_oldlocal|, |v:option_oldglobal| now have the type of the option
    instead of always being strings. |v:option_old| is now the old global
    value for all global-local options, instead of just string global-local
    options.
  • Local value for a global-local number/boolean option is now unset when the
    option is set (e.g. using |:set| or |nvim_set_option_value()|) without
    a scope, which means they now behave the same way as string options.

• Plugins:
  • |:TOhtml| has been rewritten in Lua to support Nvim-specific decorations,
    and many options have been removed.

• Treesitter:
  • Treesitter highlight groups have been renamed to be more in line with
    upstream tree-sitter and Helix to make it easier to share queries. The
    full list is documented in |treesitter-highlight-groups|.

• TUI:
  • In some cases, the cursor in the Nvim |TUI| used to blink even without
    configuring 'guicursor' as mentioned in |cursor-blinking|. This was a bug
    that has now been fixed. If your cursor has stopped blinking, add the
    following (or similar, adapted to user preference) to your |config| file: >vim
      set guicursor+=n-v-c:blinkon500-blinkoff500
<

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES

The following new features were added.

• API:
  • Passing 0 to |nvim_get_chan_info()| gets info about the current channel.
  • |nvim_buf_set_extmark()| supports inline virtual text.
  • |nvim_win_text_height()| computes the number of screen lines occupied
    by a range of text in a given window.
  • New RPC client type `msgpack-rpc` is added for |nvim_set_client_info()| to
    support fully MessagePack-RPC compliant clients.
  • Floating windows can now be hidden by setting `hide` in |nvim_open_win()| or
    |nvim_win_set_config()|.
  • |nvim_input_mouse()| supports mouse buttons "x1" and "x2".
  • Added "force_crlf" option field in |nvim_open_term()|.
  • Added |nvim_tabpage_set_win()| to set the current window of a tabpage.
  • Mapping APIs now support abbreviations when mode short-name has suffix "a".
  • Floating windows can now show footer with new `footer` and `footer_pos`
    config fields. Uses |hl-FloatFooter| by default.
  • |extmarks| can set a "url" highlight attribute, so the text region can
    become a clickable hyperlink (assuming UI support). The TUI renders URLs
    using the OSC 8 control sequence, enabling clickable text in supporting
    terminals.
  • |nvim_open_win()| and |nvim_win_set_config()| now support opening normal
    (split) windows, moving floating windows into split windows, and opening
    windows in non-current tabpages.
  • Flags added to |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|:
    • "undo_restore": opt-out extmarks of precise undo tracking.
    • "invalidate": automatically hide or delete extmarks.
    • "virt_text_repeat_linebreak": repeat virtual text on wrapped lines.
  • Extmarks now fully support multi-line ranges, and a single extmark can be
    used to highlight a range of arbitrary length. The |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|
    API function already allowed you to define such ranges, but highlight
    regions were not rendered consistently for a range that covers more than
    one line break. This has now been fixed. Signs defined as part of
    a multi-line extmark also apply to every line in the range, not just the
    first. In addition, |nvim_buf_get_extmarks()| has gained an "overlap"
    option to return such ranges even if they started before the specified
    position.

• Defaults:
  • The `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` LSP client capability is now enabled
    by default on Mac and Windows. Disabled on Linux since there currently
    isn't a viable backend for watching files that scales well for large
    directories.
  • On Windows 'isfname' does not include ":". Drive letters are handled
    correctly without it. (Use |gF| for filepaths suffixed with ":line:col").
  • 'comments' includes "fb:•".
  • 'shortmess' includes the "C" flag.
  • 'grepprg' uses the -H and -I flags for grep by default,
    and defaults to using ripgrep if available.
  • "]d" and "[d" in Normal mode map to |vim.diagnostic.goto_next()| and
    |vim.diagnostic.goto_prev()|, respectively. |]d-default| |[d-default|
  • <C-W>d (and <C-W><C-D>) map to |vim.diagnostic.open_float()|
    |CTRL-W_d-default|
  • |vim.lsp.start()| sets the following default keymaps (assuming server
    support):
    • |K| in Normal mode maps to |vim.lsp.buf.hover()|, unless 'keywordprg'
      was customized before calling |vim.lsp.start()|.
  • Automatic linting of treesitter query files (see |ft-query-plugin|).
    Can be disabled via: >lua
      vim.g.query_lint_on = {}
<
  • Enabled treesitter highlighting for:
    • Treesitter query files
    • Vim help files
    • Lua files

• Editor:
  • Better cmdline completion for string option value. |complete-set-option|
    • Try it with `:set listchars=<Tab>`
  • By default, the swapfile "ATTENTION" |E325| dialog is skipped if the
    swapfile is owned by a running Nvim process, instead of prompting. If you
    always want the swapfile dialog, delete the default SwapExists handler:
    `autocmd! nvim_swapfile`. |default-autocmds|
  • Navigating the |jumplist| with CTRL+O, CTRL+I behaves more intuitively
    when deleting buffers, and avoids "invalid buffer" cases. #25461
  • |:fclose| command.
  • |v_Q-default| and |v_@-default| repeat a register for each line of a linewise
    visual selection.
  • Clicking on a tabpage in the tabline with the middle mouse button closes it.
  • |:checkhealth| buffer can be opened in a split window using modifiers like
    |:vertical|, |:horizontal| and |:botright|.

• Events:
  • |vim.on_key()| callbacks receive a second argument for keys typed before
    mappings are applied.

• LSP:
  • LSP method names are available in |vim.lsp.protocol.Methods|.
  • Implemented LSP inlay hints: |lsp-inlay_hint|
    https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_inlayHint
  • Implemented pull diagnostic textDocument/diagnostic: |vim.lsp.diagnostic.on_diagnostic()|
    https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_diagnostic
  • Implemented LSP type hierarchy: |vim.lsp.buf.typehierarchy()|
    https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_prepareTypeHierarchy
  • |vim.lsp.status()| consumes the last progress messages as a string.
  • LSP client now always saves and restores named buffer marks when applying
    text edits.
  • LSP client now supports the `positionEncoding` server capability. If a server
    responds with the `positionEncoding` capability in its initialization
    response, Nvim automatically sets the client's `offset_encoding` field.
  • Dynamic registration of LSP capabilities. An implication of this change is
    that checking a client's `server_capabilities` is no longer a sufficient
    indicator to see if a server supports a feature. Instead use
    `client.supports_method(<method>)`. It considers both the dynamic
    capabilities and static `server_capabilities`.
  • `anchor_bias` option to |lsp-handlers| aids in positioning of floating
    windows.
  • |vim.lsp.util.locations_to_items()| sets the `user_data` of each item to
    the original LSP `Location` or `LocationLink`.
  • Added support for connecting to servers using named pipes (Windows) or
    Unix domain sockets (Unix) via |vim.lsp.rpc.connect()|.
  • Added support for `completionList.itemDefaults`, reducing overhead when
    computing completion items where properties often share the same value
    (e.g. `commitCharacters`). Note that this might affect plugins and
    language servers that don't support the feature, and in such cases the
    respective capability can be unset.
  • |vim.lsp.start()| accepts a "silent" option for suppressing messages
    if an LSP server failed to start.
  • |vim.lsp.buf.definition()|, |vim.lsp.buf.declaration()|,
    |vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()|, and |vim.lsp.buf.implementation()| now
    support the `loclist` field of |vim.lsp.ListOpts|.

• Lua:
  • |:lua| with a |[range]| executes that range as Lua code, in any buffer.
  • |:source| without arguments treats a buffer with 'filetype' of "lua" as
    Lua code regardless of its extension.
  • Vimscript function |exists()| supports checking |v:lua| functions.
  • |vim.iter()| is a generic interface for all |iterable| objects (tables,
    |iterator|s).
  • |vim.snippet| provides a mode for expanding and navigating snippets.
  • |vim.ringbuf()| is a generic ring buffer (data structure).
  • |vim.deepcopy()| gained a `noref` argument to avoid hashing table values.
  • |vim.keycode()| translates keycodes in a string.
  • |vim.system()| runs commands / starts processes.
  • |vim.lpeg| and |vim.re| expose the bundled Lpeg expression grammar parser
    and its regex interface.
  • |vim.base64.encode()| and |vim.base64.decode()| encode and decode strings
    using Base64 encoding.
  • |vim.text.hexencode()| and |vim.text.hexdecode()| convert strings to and
    from byte representations.
  • |vim.ui.open()| opens URIs using the system default handler (macOS `open`,
    Windows `explorer`, Linux `xdg-open`, etc.)
  • |vim.wo| can now be double indexed for |:setlocal| behaviour. Currently
    only `0` for the buffer index is supported.
  • Improved messages for type errors in `vim.api.*` calls (including `opts` params).
  • Lua type annotations for:
    • `vim.*`
    • `vim.fn.*`
    • `vim.api.*`
    • `vim.v.*`
  • Functions that take a severity as an optional parameter (e.g.
    |vim.diagnostic.get()|) now also accept a list of severities |vim.diagnostic.severity|
  • |vim.diagnostic.count()| returns the number of diagnostics for a given
    buffer and/or namespace, by severity. This is a faster alternative to
    |vim.diagnostic.get()| when only the number of diagnostics is needed, but
    not the diagnostics themselves.
  • |vim.diagnostic.is_enabled()|
  • |vim.version.le()|, |vim.version.ge()|
  • |vim.fs.root()| finds project root directories from a list of "root
    markers".
  • |vim.tbl_contains()| now works for general tables and allows specifying
    a predicate function that is checked for each value. (Use
    |vim.list_contains()| for checking list-like tables (integer keys without
    gaps) for literal values.)
  • vim.region() can use a string accepted by |getpos()| as position.

• Options:
  • 'winfixbuf' keeps a window focused onto a specific buffer
  • 'smoothscroll' option to scroll by screen line rather than by text line
    when 'wrap' is set.
  • 'foldtext' now supports virtual text format. |fold-foldtext|
  • 'foldtext' can be set to an empty string to disable and render the line:
    as normal with regular highlighting and no line wrapping.
  • 'complete' option supports "f" flag for completing buffer names.
  • 'completeopt' option supports "popup" flag to show extra information in
    a floating window.
  • 'errorfile' (|-q|) accepts `-` as an alias for stdin.

• Performance:
  • 'diffopt' "linematch" scoring algorithm now favours larger and less groups
    https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/23611
  • Treesitter highlighting now parses injections incrementally during
    screen redraws only for the line range being rendered. This significantly
    improves performance in large files with many injections.
  • 'breakindent' performance is significantly improved for wrapped lines.
  • Cursor movement, insertion with [count] and |screenpos()| are now faster.

• Plugins:
  • Nvim now includes |commenting| support.
  • |:Man| supports the `:hide` modifier to open page in the current window.
  • |:Man| respects 'wrapmargin'

• Startup:
  • |$NVIM_APPNAME| can be set to a relative path instead of only a name.
  • |--startuptime| reports startup times for both processes (TUI + server) as
    separate sections.

• Terminal:
  • |:terminal| accepts some |:command-modifiers| (specifically |:horizontal|
    and those that affect splitting a window).
  • Terminal buffers emit a |TermRequest| autocommand event when the child
    process emits an OSC or DCS control sequence.
  • Terminal buffers respond to OSC background and foreground requests.
    |default-autocmds|

• Treesitter:
  • Bundled parsers and queries (highlight, folds) for Markdown, Python, and
    Bash.
  • |:InspectTree| shows root nodes.
  • |:InspectTree| now supports |folding|.
  • |:InspectTree| shows node ranges in 0-based instead of 1-based indexing.
  • |vim.treesitter.foldexpr()| now recognizes folds captured using a
    quantified query pattern.
  • |vim.treesitter.query.omnifunc()| provides completion in treesitter query
    files (set by default).
  • |vim.treesitter.query.edit()| provides live editing of treesitter queries.
  • |Query:iter_matches()| now has the ability to set the maximum start depth
    for matches.
  • `@injection.language` now has smarter resolution and will fall back to
    language aliases (e.g., filetype or custom shorthands) registered via
    |vim.treesitter.language.register()| and/or attempt lower case variants of
    the text.
  • `@injection.filename` will try to match the node text via
    |vim.filetype.match()| and treat the result as a language name in the same
    way as `@injection.language`.
  • The `#set!` directive supports `injection.self` and `injection.parent` for
    injecting either the current node's language or the parent
    |LanguageTree|'s language, respectively.
  • The `#set!` directive can set the "url" property of a node to have the
    node emit a hyperlink. Hyperlinks are UI specific: in the TUI, the OSC 8
    control sequence is used.
  • Improved error messages for query parsing.

• TUI:
  • Builtin TUI can now recognize "super" (|<D-|) and "meta" (|<T-|) modifiers
    in a terminal emulator that supports |tui-csiu|.
  • The |TermResponse| event can be used with |v:termresponse| to read escape
    sequence responses from the host terminal.
  • A clipboard provider which uses OSC 52 to copy the selection to the system
    clipboard is now bundled by default and will be automatically enabled under
    certain conditions. |clipboard-osc52|
  • 'termsync' option asks the host terminal to buffer screen updates until
    the redraw cycle is complete. Requires support from the host terminal.

• UI:
  • Enhanced support for rendering multibyte characters using composing
    characters: the maximum limit was increased from 1+6 codepoints to
    31 bytes, which is guaranteed to fit all chars from before but often more.
    • NOTE: the regexp engine still has a hard-coded limit of considering
      6 composing chars only.


==============================================================================
CHANGED FEATURES

These existing features changed their behavior.

• API:
  • |nvim_buf_call()| and |nvim_win_call()| now preserve any return value (NB:
    not multiple return values)

• Editor:
  • |gx| now uses |vim.ui.open()| and not netrw. To customize, you can redefine
    `vim.ui.open` or remap `gx`. To continue using netrw (deprecated): >vim
    :call netrw#BrowseX(expand(exists("g:netrw_gx") ? g:netrw_gx : '<cfile>'), netrw#CheckIfRemote())<CR>

• LSP:
  • LSP hover and signature help now use Treesitter for highlighting of
    Markdown content. Note that highlighting of code examples requires
    a matching parser and may be affected by custom queries.
  • |LspRequest| autocmd callbacks contain more information about the LSP
    request status update that occurred.

• Lua:
  • |vim.wait()| cannot be called in |api-fast|.
  • |vim.diagnostic.config()| now accepts virtual text relevant options to
    |nvim_buf_set_extmark()| (e.g. "virt_text_pos" and "hl_mode") in its
    "virtual_text" table, which gives users more control over how diagnostic
    virtual text is displayed.
  • |vim.diagnostic.get()| and |vim.diagnostic.count()| accept multiple
    namespaces rather than just a single namespace.
  • |vim.diagnostic.enable()| gained new parameters, and the old signature is
    deprecated.
  • |vim.diagnostic.config()| now accepts a function for the virtual_text.prefix
    option, which allows for rendering e.g., diagnostic severities differently.

• Options:
  • Attempting to set an invalid keycode option (e.g. `set t_foo=123`) no
    longer gives an error.

• Terminal:
  • Terminal buffers started with no arguments (and use 'shell') close
    automatically if the job exited without error, eliminating the (often
    unwanted) "[Process exited 0]" message. |default-autocmds|

• Treesitter:
  • |Query:iter_matches()|, |vim.treesitter.query.add_predicate()|, and
    |vim.treesitter.query.add_directive()| accept a new `all` option which
    ensures that all matching nodes are returned as a table. The default option
    `all=false` returns only a single node, breaking captures with quantifiers
    like `(comment)+ @comment`; it is only provided for backward compatibility
    and will be removed after Nvim 0.10.
  • |vim.treesitter.query.add_predicate()| and
    |vim.treesitter.query.add_directive()| now accept an options table rather
    than a boolean "force" argument. To force a predicate or directive to
    override an existing predicate or directive, use `{ force = true }`.

==============================================================================
REMOVED FEATURES

These deprecated features were removed.

• Vimball support, including `:Vimuntar` command

• Support for legacy treesitter injection queries

• 'shortmess' flags:
  • |shm-f|. Always use "(3 of 5)", never "(file 3 of 5)".
  • |shm-i|. Always use "[noeol]".
  • |shm-x|. Always use "[dos]", "[unix]" and "[mac]".
  • |shm-n|. Always use "[New]".
