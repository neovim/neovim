Differences between Nvim and Vim			       *vim-differences*

Throughout the help files, differences between Nvim and Vim are indicated via
the "{Nvim}" tag.  This document is a complete and centralized list of all
these differences.

1. Configuration		|nvim-configuration|
2. Option defaults		|nvim-option-defaults|
3. Changed features		|nvim-features-changed|
4. New features			|nvim-features-new|
5. Missing legacy features	|nvim-features-missing|
6. Removed features		|nvim-features-removed|


==============================================================================
1. Configuration					    *nvim-configuration*

- Use ".nvimrc" instead of ".vimrc" for storing configuration.
- Use ".nvim" instead of ".vim" to store configuration files.
- Use ".nviminfo" instead of ".viminfo" for persistent session information.

==============================================================================
2. Option defaults					  *nvim-option-defaults*

- 'nocompatible' is always set
- 'encoding' defaults to "utf-8"

==============================================================================
3. Changed features					 *nvim-features-changed*

Nvim always builds with all features, in contrast to Vim which may have
certain features removed/added at compile-time.  This is like if Vim's "HUGE"
build was the only Vim release type (except Nvim is smaller than Vim's "HUGE"
build).

If a Python interpreter is available on your `$PATH`, |:python| and |:python3|
are always available and may be used simultaneously in separate plugins.  The
`neovim` pip package must be installed to use Python plugins in Nvim (see
|nvim-python|).

==============================================================================
4. New Features						     *nvim-features-new*

See |nvim-intro| for a list of Nvim's largest new features.

Nvim has a built-in terminal emulator, which can be accessed using
`:term[inal]`.  By default, <C-\><C-n> exits terminal mode, but `:tmap` and
`:tnoremap` can be used to change this and create other terminal mode
mappings.

Meta key chords are recognized (even in the terminal).
- <M-1>, <M-2>, ...
- <M-BS>, <M-Del>, <M-Ins>, ...
- <M-/>, <M-\>, ...
- <M-Space>, <M-Enter>, <M-=>, <M-->, <M-?>, <M-$>, ...

CTRL-SHIFT-... key chords are distinguished from CTRL-... variants (even in
the terminal).
- <C-Tab>, <C-S-Tab>
- <C-BS>, <C-S-BS>
- <C-Enter>, <C-S-Enter>

Events:
- |TabNew|
- |TabNewEntered|
- |TabClosed|

Highlight groups:
- |hl-EndOfBuffer|

==============================================================================
5. Missing legacy features				 *nvim-features-missing*

These legacy Vim features may be implemented in the future, but they are not
planned for the current milestone.

- vim.bindeval() (new feature in Vim 7.4 Python interface)
- if_ruby
- if_lua
- if_perl
- if_mzscheme
- if_tcl

==============================================================================
6. Removed features					 *nvim-features-removed*

These features are in Vim, but have been intentionally removed from Nvim.

Vi-compatible mode
- ":set nocompatible" is ignored
- ":set compatible" is an error

Ed-compatible mode
- ":set noedcompatible" is ignored
- ":set edcompatible" is an error

'ttyfast'
- ":set ttyfast" is ignored
- ":set nottyfast" is an error

EBCDIC support

8.3 filesystem support
- 'shortname'

Encryption support
- 'cryptmethod'
- 'key'

MS-DOS support
- 'bioskey'
- 'conskey'

'shelltype'
":shell"
":mode", no longer accepts an argument
'textauto'
'textmode'

"Easy mode" (eview, evim, nvim -y)
"(g)vimdiff" (solely an alias for (g)nvim -d, i.e. |diff-mode|)
"Vi mode" (nvim -v)

The ability to start nvim via the following aliases has been removed in favor
of just using their command line arguments:

  ex        nvim -e
  exim      nvim -E
  view      nvim -R
  gvim      nvim -g
  gex       nvim -eg
  gview     nvim -Rg
  rvim      nvim -Z
  rview     nvim -RZ
  rgvim     nvim -gZ
  rgview    nvim -RgZ
