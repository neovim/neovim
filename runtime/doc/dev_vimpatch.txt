Merging patches from Vim                                    *dev-vimpatch*


Nvim was forked from Vim 7.4.160; it is kept up-to-date with relevant Vim
patches in order to avoid duplicate work. Run `vim-patch.sh`
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/scripts/vim-patch.sh to see the
status of Vim patches:
>bash
    ./scripts/vim-patch.sh -l
<
Everyone is welcome to |dev-vimpatch-pull-requests| for relevant Vim
patches, but some types of patches are |dev-vimpatch-not-applicable|.
See |dev-vimpatch-quickstart| to get started immediately.


                                         Type |gO| to see the table of contents.

==============================================================================
QUICKSTART                                        *dev-vimpatch-quickstart*

1. Pull the Nvim source:
>bash
    git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git
<
2. Run `./scripts/vim-patch.sh -l` to see the list of missing Vim patches.

3. Choose a patch from the list (usually the oldest one), e.g. `8.0.0123`.

   - Check for open vim-patch PRs
     https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Avim-patch.

4. Run `./scripts/vim-patch.sh -p 8.0.0123`

5. Follow the instructions given by the script.

NOTES ~

- It's strongly recommended to work on the oldest missing patch, because
  later patches might depend on the changes.
- Use `git log --grep` or `git log -G` to search the Nvim/Vim source history
  (even deleted code). E.g. to find `reset_option_was_set`: >bash

    git log -p -G reset_option_was_set
<
- Pass `git log` options like `--grep` and `-G` to `./scripts/vim-patch.sh -L`
  to filter unmerged Vim patches E.g. to find `+quickfix` patches: >bash

    ./scripts/vim-patch.sh -L --grep quickfix -- src

PULL REQUESTS                                  *dev-vimpatch-pull-requests*

Note: vim-patch.sh automates these steps for you. Use it!

- Install `gh` (https://cli.github.com/) if you want to use `vim-patch.sh` to
  create PRs automatically
- The pull request title should include `vim-patch:8.x.xxxx` (no whitespace)
- The commit message
  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/4ccf1125ff569eccfc34abc4ad794044c5ab7455
  should include:
    - A token indicating the Vim patch number, formatted as follows:
      `vim-patch:8.0.0123` (no whitespace)
    - A URL pointing to the Vim commit:
      https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/c8020ee825b9d9196b1329c0e097424576fc9b3a
    - The original Vim commit message, including author

Reviewers: hint for reviewing `runtime/` patches

==============================================================================
NA (NOT APPLICABLE) PATCHES                    *dev-vimpatch-not-applicable*

Many Vim patches are not applicable to Nvim. If you find NA patches, visit an
open "version.c: update" pull request
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aapp%2Fgithub-actions+version.c+is%3Aopen
and mention the NA patches in a comment (please edit/update one comment,
rather than adding a new comment for each patch).

If there are no open `version.c: update` pull requests, include NA patches in
a commit message in the following format:
>
    vim-patch:<version-or-commit>
    vim-patch:<version-or-commit>
    ...
<
where `<version-or-commit>` is a valid Vim version (like `8.0.0123`) or
commit-id (SHA). Each patch is on a separate line.

It is preferred to include NA patches by squashing it in applicable Vim
patches, especially if the Vim patches are related. First line of the commit
message should be from the applicable Vim patch.
>
    ./scripts/vim-patch -p <na-patch>
    ./scripts/vim-patch -p <na-patch>
    ...
    ./scripts/vim-patch -P <patch>
    git rebase -i master
<
Example:

TYPES OF "NOT APPLICABLE" VIM PATCHES ~

- Vim9script features, and anything related to `:scriptversion`. (Nvim
  supports Vimscript version 1 only.) Be aware that patches labelled `Vim9:`
  may still contain applicable fixes to other parts of the codebase, so these
  patch need to be checked individually.
- Updates to `testdir/Makefile` are usually NA because the Makefile implicitly
  finds
  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/8a677f8a4bff6005fa39f090c14e970c3dfdbe6e#diff-b3c6ad6680a25a1b42095879e3a87104R52
  all `test_*.vim` files.
- Compiler warning fixes: Nvim strives to have no warnings at all, and has a
  very different build system from Vim.
    - Note: Coverity fixes in Vim are relevant to Nvim.
- `*.proto` changes: Nvim autogenerates function prototypes
- `#ifdef` tweaking: For example, Vim decided to enable `FEAT_VISUAL` for all
  platforms - but Nvim already does that. Adding new `FEAT_` guards also isn't
  relevant to Nvim.
- Legacy system support: Fixes for legacy systems such as Amiga, OS/2 Xenix,
  Mac OS 9, Windows older than XP SP2, are not needed because they are not
  supported by Nvim.
    - NA files: `src/Make_*`, `src/testdir/Make__*`
- `if_*.c` changes: `if_python.c` et. al. were removed.
- `term.c` changes: the Nvim TUI uses `libtermkey` to read terminal sequences;
  Vim's `term.c` was removed.
- `job` patches: incompatible API and implementation
    - NA files: `src/channel_*`, `src/job_*`, `src/testdir/test_channel_*`,
      `src/testdir/test_job_*`
- `:terminal` patches that modify NA files: incompatible API and
  implementation
    - NA files: `src/terminal_*`, `src/testdir/test_terminal_*`
- `defaults.vim` patches
- Most GUI-related changes: Nvim GUIs are implemented external to the core C
  codebase.
    - NA files: `src/gui_*`, `src/gvim_*`, `src/GvimExt/*`, `src/testdir/test_gui*`
- `balloon` changes: Nvim does not support balloon feature
    - NA files: `src/beval_*`, `src/testdir/test_balloon_*`
- libvterm changes: Nvim does not vendor libvterm in `src/`.
- Screendump tests from `test_popupwin.vim`, `test_popupwin_textprop.vim`:
  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12741#issuecomment-704677141
- json changes: incompatible API https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/4131
    - NA files: `src/json*`, `src/testdir/test_json.vim`
- `test_restricted.vim` restricted mode is removed in
  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11996
- Many tests in `test_prompt_buffer.vim` require incompatible Vim features
  such as `channel`; they should still be included, but skipped
- non-runtime documentation: Moved to https://neovim.io/doc/,
    - NA files: `Filelist`, `README`, `INSTALL`,
- Anything else might be relevant; err on the side of caution, and post an
  issue if you aren't sure.

==============================================================================
VERSION.C                                          *dev-vimpatch-version.c*

The list of Vim patches in `src/nvim/version.c` is automatically updated
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7780 based on the presence of
`vim-patch:xxx` tokens in the Nvim git log.

- Don't update `src/nvim/version.c` yourself.
    - `scripts/vim-patch.sh -p` intentionally omits `version.c` to avoid merge
      conflicts and save time when porting a patch.
- The automation script (`scripts/vimpatch.lua`) only recognizes tokens like
  `vim-patch:8.0.1206`, not `vim-patch:<hash>`.

Make sure to note the difference between `utf_` and `utfc_` when replacing
`mb_` functions. Also indirect call syntax `(*mb_ptr2len)(...)` should be
replaced with an ordinary function call `utfc_ptr2len(...)`.

- Vim's `ga_init2` was renamed to `ga_init` and the original `ga_init` is
  gone.
- "Old style" Vim tests (`src/testdir/*.in`) should be converted to Lua tests
  (see #1286 https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1286 and #1328
  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1328). See Checklist for migrating
  legacy tests
  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/test/README.md#checklist-for-migrating-legacy-tests.
    - However, please do not convert "new style" Vim tests
      (`src/testdir/*.vim`) to Lua. The "new style" Vim tests are faster than
      the old ones, and converting them takes time and effort better spent
      elsewhere. Just copy them to `test/old/testdir/*.vim`.
- Conditions that check `enc_utf8` or `has_mbyte` are obsolete (only the
  "true" case is applicable).
    - `enc_utf8` and `has_mbyte` macros were removed in
      https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/13293
- Check for `CSI` in typeahead buffer is only necessary in Vim with
  `FEAT_GUI`. `CSI` does not have a special meaning in typeahead buffer in
  Nvim. (also see https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16936)

LIST MANAGEMENT                              *dev-vimpatch-list-management*

Management of lists (types `list_T` and `listitem_T` from vim) was changed in
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7708/. There is a lint against the "old"
usage, but here are the most important changes.

Declarations for the table

- `list_T list`: a list
- `listitem_T li`: an item of `list`
- `int val` a value for `lv_copyID`

  li->li_next                     TV_LIST_ITEM_NEXT(list, li)          To be avoided if possible, must use list which li belongs to.
  li->li_prev                     TV_LIST_ITEM_PREV(list, li)          To be avoided if possible, must use list which li belongs to.
                                  Suggestion by @ZyX-l:                Use TV_LIST_ITER or indexing instead of the previous two calls.

  for (li = list->lv_first;       TV_LIST_ITER_CONST(list, li,         Use TV_LIST_ITER(...) if you need to
  li != NULL && another_cond;     { if (another_cond) {break;} code})  modify list items (note: assigning copyID is also modification and this happens
  li = li->li_next) code                                               always when recursively traversing a list).

DOCUMENTATION DIFFERENCES          *dev-vimpatch-documentation*

The following should be removed from all imported documentation, and not be
used in new documentation:

- `{Only when compiled with ...}`: the vast majority of features have been
  made non-optional (see https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Introduction)

==============================================================================
FILETYPE DETECTION                 *dev-vimpatch-filetype*

Nvim's filetype detection behavior matches Vim, but is implemented as part of
|vim.filetype| (see $VIMRUNTIME/lua/vim/filetype.lua).

Pattern matching has several differences:
- It is done using explicit Lua patterns (without implicit anchoring) instead
  of Vim regexes: >
    "*/debian/changelog" -> "/debian/changelog$"
    "*/bind/db.*" -> "/bind/db%."
<
- Filetype patterns are grouped by their parent pattern to improve matching
  performance. For this to work properly, parent pattern should:
    - Match at least the same set of strings as filetype patterns inside it.
      But not too much more.
    - Be fast to match.

  When adding a new filetype with pattern matching, consider the following:
  - If there is already a group with appropriate parent pattern, use it.
  - If there can be a fast and specific enough pattern to group at least
    3 filetype patterns, add it as a separate grouped entry.

    Good new parent pattern should be:
      - Fast. Good rule of thumb is that it should be a short explicit string
        (i.e. no quantifiers or character sets).
      - Specific. Good rules of thumb (from best to worst):
          - Full directory name (like "/etc/", "/log/").
          - Part of a rare enough directory name (like "/conf", "git/").
          - String reasonably rarely used in real full paths (like "nginx").

  Example:
  - Filetype pattern: ".*/etc/a2ps/.*%.cfg"
  - Good parent: "/etc/"; "%.cfg$"
  - Bad parent: "%." - fast, not specific; "/a2ps/.*%." - slow, specific
