Terminal emulator				*terminal* *terminal-emulator*

Nvim embeds a VT220/xterm terminal emulator based on libvterm. The terminal is
presented as a special buffer type, asynchronously updated from the virtual
terminal as data is received from the program connected to it.

Terminal buffers behave like normal buffers, except:
- With 'modifiable', lines can be edited but not deleted.
- 'scrollback' controls how many lines are kept.
- Output is followed if the cursor is on the last line.
- 'modified' is the default. You can set 'nomodified' to avoid a warning when
  closing the terminal buffer.
- 'bufhidden' defaults to "hide".

				      Type |gO| to see the table of contents.

==============================================================================
Start						*terminal-start*

There are 3 ways to create a terminal buffer:

- By invoking the |:terminal| ex command.
- By calling the |termopen()| function.
- By editing a file with a name matching `term://(.{-}//(\d+:)?)?\zs.*`.
  For example:
>
    :edit term://bash
    :vsplit term://top
<
    Note: The "term://" pattern is handled by a BufReadCmd handler, so the
    |autocmd-nested| modifier is required to use it in an autocmd. >
        autocmd VimEnter * ++nested split term://sh
<    This is only mentioned for reference; use |:terminal| instead.

When the terminal starts, the buffer contents are updated and the buffer is
named in the form of `term://{cwd}//{pid}:{cmd}`. This naming scheme is used
by |:mksession| to restore a terminal buffer (by restarting the {cmd}).

==============================================================================
Input						*terminal-input*

To send input, enter |Terminal-mode| using any command that would enter "insert
mode" in a normal buffer, such as |i| or |:startinsert|. In this mode all keys
except <C-\><C-N> are sent to the underlying program. Use <C-\><C-N> to return
to normal-mode. |CTRL-\_CTRL-N|

Terminal-mode has its own |:tnoremap| namespace for mappings, this can be used
to automate any terminal interaction.

To map <Esc> to exit terminal-mode: >
    :tnoremap <Esc> <C-\><C-n>

To simulate |i_CTRL-R| in terminal-mode: >
    :tnoremap <expr> <C-R> '<C-\><C-N>"'.nr2char(getchar()).'pi'

To use `ALT+{h,j,k,l}` to navigate windows from any mode: >
    :tnoremap <A-h> <C-\><C-N><C-w>h
    :tnoremap <A-j> <C-\><C-N><C-w>j
    :tnoremap <A-k> <C-\><C-N><C-w>k
    :tnoremap <A-l> <C-\><C-N><C-w>l
    :inoremap <A-h> <C-\><C-N><C-w>h
    :inoremap <A-j> <C-\><C-N><C-w>j
    :inoremap <A-k> <C-\><C-N><C-w>k
    :inoremap <A-l> <C-\><C-N><C-w>l
    :nnoremap <A-h> <C-w>h
    :nnoremap <A-j> <C-w>j
    :nnoremap <A-k> <C-w>k
    :nnoremap <A-l> <C-w>l

Mouse input has the following behavior:

- If the program has enabled mouse events, the corresponding events will be
  forwarded to the program.
- If mouse events are disabled (the default), terminal focus will be lost and
  the event will be processed as in a normal buffer.
- If another window is clicked, terminal focus will be lost and nvim will jump
  to the clicked window
- If the mouse wheel is used while the mouse is positioned in another window,
  the terminal wont lose focus and the hovered window will be scrolled.

==============================================================================
Configuration					*terminal-configuration*

Options:		'modified', 'scrollback'
Events:			|TermOpen|, |TermClose|
Highlight groups:	|hl-TermCursor|, |hl-TermCursorNC|

Terminal sets local defaults for some options, which may differ from your
global configuration.

- 'list' is disabled
- 'wrap' is disabled

You can change the defaults with a TermOpen autocommand: >
	au TermOpen * setlocal list

TERMINAL COLORS ~

The `{g,b}:terminal_color_$NUM` variables control the terminal color palette,
where `$NUM` is the color index between 0 and 255 inclusive. This setting only
affects UIs with RGB capabilities; for normal terminals the color index is
just forwarded. The variables are read only during |TermOpen|.

==============================================================================
Status Variables				*terminal-status*

Terminal buffers maintain some information about the terminal in buffer-local
variables:

- *b:term_title* The settable title of the terminal, typically displayed in
  the window title or tab title of a graphical terminal emulator. Programs
  running in the terminal can set this title via an escape sequence.
- |'channel'| The nvim channel ID for the underlying PTY.
  |chansend()| can be used to send input to the terminal.

These variables are initialized before TermOpen, so you can use them in
a local 'statusline'. Example: >
    :autocmd TermOpen * setlocal statusline=%{b:term_title}
<
