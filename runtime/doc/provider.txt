Providers	 				*provider*

Nvim delegates some features to dynamic "providers". This document describes
the providers and how to install them.
						*E319*
Use of a feature requiring a missing provider is an error: >

    E319: No "foo" provider found. Run ":checkhealth provider"

Run the |:checkhealth| command, and review the sections below.

==============================================================================
Python integration				*provider-python*

Nvim supports Python |remote-plugin|s and the Vim legacy |python2| and
|python3| interfaces (which are implemented as remote-plugins).

Note: Only the Vim 7.3 legacy interface is supported, not later features such
as |python-bindeval| (Vim 7.4); use the Nvim API instead.


PYTHON QUICKSTART ~

To use Python plugins, you need the "pynvim" module. Run |:checkhealth| to see
if you already have it (some package managers install the module with Nvim
itself).

For Python 3 plugins:
1. Make sure Python 3.4+ is available in your $PATH.
2. Install the module (try "python" if "python3" is missing): >
   python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim

For Python 2 plugins:
1. Make sure Python 2.7 is available in your $PATH.
2. Install the module (try "python" if "python2" is missing): >
   python2 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim

The pip `--upgrade` flag ensures that you get the latest version even if
a previous version was already installed.

See also |python-virtualenv|.

Note: The old "neovim" module was renamed to "pynvim".
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Following-HEAD#20181118
If you run into problems, uninstall _both_ then install "pynvim" again: >
  python -m pip uninstall neovim pynvim
  python -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim


PYTHON PROVIDER CONFIGURATION ~
						*g:python_host_prog*
Command to start Python 2 (executable, not directory). Setting this makes
startup faster. Useful for working with virtualenvs.  >
    let g:python_host_prog  = '/path/to/python'
<
						*g:python3_host_prog*
Command to start Python 3 (executable, not directory). Setting this makes
startup faster. Useful for working with virtualenvs.  >
    let g:python3_host_prog = '/path/to/python3'
<
						*g:loaded_python_provider*
To disable Python 2 support: >
    let g:loaded_python_provider = 1
<
						*g:loaded_python3_provider*
To disable Python 3 support: >
    let g:loaded_python3_provider = 1


PYTHON VIRTUALENVS ~
						*python-virtualenv*
If you plan to use per-project virtualenvs often, you should assign one
virtualenv for Neovim and hard-code the interpreter path via
|g:python3_host_prog| (or |g:python_host_prog|) so that the "pynvim" package
is not required for each virtualenv.

Example using pyenv: >
    pyenv install 3.4.4
    pyenv virtualenv 3.4.4 py3nvim
    pyenv activate py3nvim
    pip install pynvim
    pyenv which python  # Note the path
The last command reports the interpreter path, add it to your init.vim: >
    let g:python3_host_prog = '/path/to/py3nvim/bin/python'

==============================================================================
Ruby integration		    	      *provider-ruby*

Nvim supports Ruby |remote-plugin|s and the Vim legacy |ruby-vim| interface
(which is itself implemented as a Nvim remote-plugin).


RUBY QUICKSTART ~

To use Ruby plugins with Nvim, install the latest "neovim" RubyGem: >
    gem install neovim

Run |:checkhealth| to see if your system is up-to-date.


RUBY PROVIDER CONFIGURATION ~
						*g:loaded_ruby_provider*
To disable Ruby support: >
    let g:loaded_ruby_provider = 1
<
						*g:ruby_host_prog*
Command to start the Ruby host. By default this is "neovim-ruby-host". With
project-local Ruby versions (via tools like RVM or rbenv) setting this can
avoid the need to install the "neovim" gem in every project.

To use an absolute path (e.g. to an rbenv installation): >
    let g:ruby_host_prog = '~/.rbenv/versions/2.4.1/bin/neovim-ruby-host'

To use the RVM "system" Ruby installation: >
    let g:ruby_host_prog = 'rvm system do neovim-ruby-host'

==============================================================================
Node.js integration				*provider-nodejs*

Nvim supports Node.js |remote-plugin|s.
https://github.com/neovim/node-client/


NODEJS QUICKSTART~

To use javascript remote-plugins with Nvim, install the "neovim" npm package: >
    npm install -g neovim

Run |:checkhealth| to see if your system is up-to-date.


NODEJS PROVIDER CONFIGURATION~
						*g:loaded_node_provider*
To disable Node.js support: >
    :let g:loaded_node_provider = 1
<
						*g:node_host_prog*
Command to start the Node.js host. Setting this makes startup faster.

By default, Nvim searches for "neovim-node-host" using "npm root -g", which
can be slow. To avoid this, set g:node_host_prog to the host path: >
    let g:node_host_prog = '/usr/local/bin/neovim-node-host'
<
==============================================================================
Clipboard integration 			      *provider-clipboard* *clipboard*

Nvim has no direct connection to the system clipboard. Instead it depends on
a |provider| which transparently uses shell commands to communicate with the
system clipboard or any other clipboard "backend".

To ALWAYS use the clipboard for ALL operations (instead of interacting with
the '+' and/or '*' registers explicitly): >
    set clipboard+=unnamedplus

See 'clipboard' for details and options.

							      *clipboard-tool*
The presence of a working clipboard tool implicitly enables the '+' and '*'
registers. Nvim looks for these clipboard tools, in order of priority:

  - |g:clipboard|
  - pbcopy, pbpaste (macOS)
  - wl-copy, wl-paste (if $WAYLAND_DISPLAY is set)
  - xclip (if $DISPLAY is set)
  - xsel (if $DISPLAY is set)
  - lemonade (for SSH) https://github.com/pocke/lemonade
  - doitclient (for SSH) http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/doit/
  - win32yank (Windows)
  - tmux (if $TMUX is set)

								 *g:clipboard*
To configure a custom clipboard tool, set g:clipboard to a dictionary.
For example this configuration integrates the tmux clipboard: >

    let g:clipboard = {
          \   'name': 'myClipboard',
          \   'copy': {
          \      '+': 'tmux load-buffer -',
          \      '*': 'tmux load-buffer -',
          \    },
          \   'paste': {
          \      '+': 'tmux save-buffer -',
          \      '*': 'tmux save-buffer -',
          \   },
          \   'cache_enabled': 1,
          \ }

If "cache_enabled" is |TRUE| then when a selection is copied Nvim will cache
the selection until the copy command process dies. When pasting, if the copy
process has not died the cached selection is applied.

g:clipboard can also use functions (see |lambda|) instead of strings.
For example this configuration uses the g:foo variable as a fake clipboard: >

    let g:clipboard = {
          \   'name': 'myClipboard',
          \   'copy': {
          \      '+': {lines, regtype -> extend(g:, {'foo': [lines, regtype]}) },
          \      '*': {lines, regtype -> extend(g:, {'foo': [lines, regtype]}) },
          \    },
          \   'paste': {
          \      '+': {-> get(g:, 'foo', [])},
          \      '*': {-> get(g:, 'foo', [])},
          \   },
          \ }

The "copy" function stores a list of lines and the register type. The "paste"
function returns the clipboard as a `[lines, regtype]` list, where `lines` is
a list of lines and `regtype` is a register type conforming to |setreg()|.

==============================================================================
X11 selection mechanism			      *clipboard-x11* *x11-selection*

X11 clipboard providers store text in "selections". Selections are owned by an
application, so when the application gets closed, the selection text is lost.
The contents of selections are held by the originating application (e.g., upon
a copy), and only passed to another application when that other application
requests them (e.g., upon a paste).

				*primary-selection* *quotestar* *quoteplus* *quote+*

There are three documented X11 selections: PRIMARY, SECONDARY, and CLIPBOARD.
CLIPBOARD is typically used in X11 applications for copy/paste operations
(CTRL-c/CTRL-v), while PRIMARY is used for the last selected text, which is
generally inserted with the middle mouse button.

Nvim's X11 clipboard providers only use the PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections,
for the "*" and "+" registers, respectively.
