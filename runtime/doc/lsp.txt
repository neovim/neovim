Neovim Language Server Protocol (LSP) API

Neovim exposes a powerful API that conforms to Microsoft's published Language
Server Protocol specification. The documentation can be found here:

  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/


================================================================================
                                                                       *lsp-api*

Neovim exposes a API for the language server protocol. To get the real benefits
of this API, a language server must be installed.
Many examples can be found here:

  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/servers/

After installing a language server to your machine, you must let Neovim know
how to start and interact with that language server.

To do so, you can either:
- Use https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp and one of the existing servers there
  or set up a new one using the `nvim_lsp/skeleton` interface (and contribute
  it if you find it useful). This uses |vim.lsp.start_client()| under the
  hood.
- Or |vim.lsp.start_client()| and |vim.lsp.buf_attach_client()|. These are the
  backbone of the LSP API. These are easy to use enough for basic or more
  complex configurations such as in |lsp-advanced-js-example|.

================================================================================
                                                           *lsp-core-api*
These are the core api functions for working with clients. You will mainly be
using |vim.lsp.start_client()| and |vim.lsp.buf_attach_client()| for operations
and |vim.lsp.get_client_by_id()| to retrieve a client by its id after it has
initialized (or {config.on_init}. see below)

                                                        *vim.lsp.start_client()*

vim.lsp.start_client({config})

  The main function used for starting clients.
  Start a client and initialize it.

  Its arguments are passed via a configuration object {config}.
 
  Mandatory parameters:~
 
  `root_dir`
    {string} specifying the directory where the LSP server will base
    as its rootUri on initialization.
 
  `cmd`
    {string} or {list} which is the base command to execute for the LSP. A
    string will be run using |'shell'| and a list will be interpreted as a
    bare command with arguments passed. This is the same as |jobstart()|.
 
  Optional parameters:~
 
  `cmd_cwd`
    {string} specifying the directory to launch the `cmd` process. This is not
    related to `root_dir`.
    By default, |getcwd()| is used.
 
  `cmd_env`
    {table} specifying the environment flags to pass to the LSP on spawn.
    This can be specified using keys like a map or as a list with `k=v` pairs
    or both. Non-string values are coerced to a string.
    For example:
      `{ "PRODUCTION=true"; "TEST=123"; PORT = 8080; HOST = "0.0.0.0"; }`
 
  `capabilities`
    A {table} which will be used instead of
    `vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()` which contains neovim's
    default capabilities and passed to the language server on initialization.
    You'll probably want to use make_client_capabilities() and modify the
    result.
    NOTE:
      To send an empty dictionary, you should use
      `{[vim.type_idx]=vim.types.dictionary}` Otherwise, it will be encoded as
      an array.
 
  `callbacks`
    A {table} of whose keys are language server method names and the values
    are `function(err, method, params, client_id)` See |lsp-callbacks| for
    more. This will be combined with |lsp-default-callbacks| to resolve
    the callbacks for a client as a fallback.
 
  `init_options`
    A {table} of values to pass in the initialization request as
    `initializationOptions`. See the `initialize` in the LSP spec.
 
  `name`
    A {string} used in log messages. Defaults to {client_id}
 
  `offset_encoding`
    One of "utf-8", "utf-16", or "utf-32" which is the encoding that the LSP
    server expects.
    The default encoding for Language Server Protocol is UTF-16, but there are
    language servers which may use other encodings.
    By default, it is "utf-16" as specified in the LSP specification. The
    client does not verify this is correct.
 
  `on_error(code, ...)`
    A function for handling errors thrown by client operation.  {code} is a
    number describing the error. Other arguments may be passed depending on
    the error kind. See |vim.lsp.client_errors| for possible errors.
    `vim.lsp.client_errors[code]` can be used to retrieve a human
    understandable string.
 
  `before_init(initialize_params, config)`
    A function which is called *before* the request `initialize` is completed.
    `initialize_params` contains the parameters we are sending to the server
    and `config` is the config that was passed to `start_client()` for
    convenience. You can use this to modify parameters before they are sent.
 
  `on_init(client, initialize_result)`
    A function which is called after the request `initialize` is completed.
    `initialize_result` contains `capabilities` and anything else the server
    may send. For example, `clangd` sends `initialize_result.offsetEncoding`
    if `capabilities.offsetEncoding` was sent to it. You can *only* modify the
    `client.offset_encoding` here before any notifications are sent.
 
  `on_attach(client, bufnr)`
    A function which is called after the client is attached to a buffer.
 
  `on_exit(code, signal, client_id)`
    A function which is called after the client has exited. code is the exit
    code of the process, and signal is a number describing the signal used to
    terminate (if any).
 
  `trace`
     "off" | "messages" | "verbose" | nil passed directly to the language
     server in the initialize request.
     Invalid/empty values will default to "off"
 
  Returns:~
    {client_id}
    You can use |vim.lsp.get_client_by_id()| to get the actual client object.
    See |lsp-client| for what the client structure will be.
 
  NOTE: The client is only available *after* it has been initialized, which
  may happen after a small delay (or never if there is an error).  For this
  reason, you may want to use `on_init` to do any actions once the client has
  been initialized.

                                                                    *lsp-client*

The client object has some methods and members related to using the client.

  Methods:~

    `request(method, params, [callback])`
      Send a request to the server. If callback is not specified, it will use
      {client.callbacks} to try to find a callback. If one is not found there,
      then an error will occur.
      This is a thin wrapper around {client.rpc.request} with some additional
      checking.
      Returns a boolean to indicate if the notification was successful. If it
      is false, then it will always be false (the client has shutdown).
      If it was successful, then it will return the request id as the second
      result. You can use this with `notify("$/cancel", { id = request_id })`
      to cancel the request. This helper is made automatically with
      |vim.lsp.buf_request()|
      Returns: status, [client_id]

    `notify(method, params)`
      This is just {client.rpc.notify}()
      Returns a boolean to indicate if the notification was successful. If it
      is false, then it will always be false (the client has shutdown).
      Returns: status

    `cancel_request(id)`
      This is just {client.rpc.notify}("$/cancelRequest", { id = id })
      Returns the same as `notify()`.

    `stop([force])`
      Stop a client, optionally with force.
      By default, it will just ask the server to shutdown without force.
      If you request to stop a client which has previously been requested to
      shutdown, it will automatically escalate and force shutdown.

    `is_stopped()`
      Returns true if the client is fully stopped.

  Members: ~
    `id` (number)
      The id allocated to the client.

    `name` (string)
      If a name is specified on creation, that will be used. Otherwise it is
      just the client id. This is used for logs and messages.

    `offset_encoding` (string)
      The encoding used for communicating with the server. You can modify this
      in the `on_init` method before text is sent to the server.

    `callbacks` (table)
      The callbacks used by the client as described in |lsp-callbacks|.

    `config` (table)
      A copy of the table that was passed by the user to
      |vim.lsp.start_client()|.

    `server_capabilities` (table)
      The response from the server sent on `initialize` describing the
      server's capabilities.

    `resolved_capabilities` (table)
      A normalized table of capabilities that we have detected based on the
      initialize response from the server in `server_capabilities`.


                                                   *vim.lsp.buf_attach_client()*
vim.lsp.buf_attach_client({bufnr}, {client_id})

  Implements the `textDocument/did*` notifications required to track a buffer
  for any language server.

  Without calling this, the server won't be notified of changes to a buffer.

                                                    *vim.lsp.get_client_by_id()*
vim.lsp.get_client_by_id({client_id})

  Look up an active client by its id, returns nil if it is not yet initialized
  or is not a valid id. Returns |lsp-client|

                                                         *vim.lsp.stop_client()*
vim.lsp.stop_client({client_id}, [{force}])

  Stop a client, optionally with force.
  By default, it will just ask the server to shutdown without force.
  If you request to stop a client which has previously been requested to
  shutdown, it will automatically escalate and force shutdown.

  You can also use `client.stop()` if you have access to the client.

                                                    *vim.lsp.stop_all_clients()*
vim.lsp.stop_all_clients([{force}])

  |vim.lsp.stop_client()|, but for all active clients.

                                                  *vim.lsp.get_active_clients()*
vim.lsp.get_active_clients()

  Return a list of all of the active clients. See |lsp-client| for a
  description of what a client looks like.

                                                    *vim.lsp.rpc_response_error()*
vim.lsp.rpc_response_error({code}, [{message}], [{data}])

  Helper function to create an RPC response object/table. This is an alias for
  |vim.lsp.rpc.rpc_response_error|. Code must be an RPC error code as
  described in `vim.lsp.protocol.ErrorCodes`.

  You can describe an optional {message} string or arbitrary {data} to send to
  the server.

================================================================================
                                                     *vim.lsp.default_callbacks*

The |vim.lsp.default_callbacks| table contains the default |lsp-callbacks|
that are used when creating a new client. The keys are the LSP method names.

The following requests and notifications have built-in callbacks defined to
handle the response in an idiomatic way.

  textDocument/publishDiagnostics
  window/logMessage
  window/showMessage

You can check these via `vim.tbl_keys(vim.lsp.default_callbacks)`.

These will be used preferrentially in `vim.lsp.buf` methods when handling
requests. They will also be used when responding to server requests and
notifications.

Use cases:
- Users can modify this to customize to their preferences.
- UI plugins can modify this by assigning to
  `vim.lsp.default_callbacks[method]` so as to provide more specialized
  handling, allowing you to leverage the UI capabilities available. UIs should
  try to be conscientious of any existing changes the user may have set
  already by checking for existing values.

Any callbacks passed directly to `request` methods on a server client will
have the highest precedence, followed by the `default_callbacks`.

More information about callbacks can be found in |lsp-callbacks|.

================================================================================
                                                                 *lsp-callbacks*

Callbacks are functions which are called in a variety of situations by the
client. Their signature is `function(err, method, params, client_id)` They can
be set by the {callbacks} parameter for |vim.lsp.start_client| or via the
|vim.lsp.default_callbacks|.

This will be called for:
- notifications from the server, where `err` will always be `nil`
- requests initiated by the server. The parameter `err` will be `nil` here as
  well.
  For these, you can respond by returning two values: `result, err` The
  err must be in the format of an RPC error, which is
    `{ code, message, data?  }` 
  You can use |vim.lsp.rpc_response_error()| to help with creating this object.
- as a callback for requests initiated by the client if the request doesn't
  explicitly specify a callback (such as in |vim.lsp.buf_request|).

================================================================================
                                                              *vim.lsp.protocol*
vim.lsp.protocol

  Contains constants as described in the Language Server Protocol
  specification and helper functions for creating protocol related objects.

  https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/raw/gh-pages/_specifications/specification-3-14.md

  Useful examples are `vim.lsp.protocol.ErrorCodes`. These objects allow
  reverse lookup by either the number or string name.

  e.g. vim.lsp.protocol.TextDocumentSyncKind.Full == 1
       vim.lsp.protocol.TextDocumentSyncKind[1] == "Full"

  Utility functions used internally are:
    `vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()`
          Make a ClientCapabilities object. These are the builtin
          capabilities.
    `vim.lsp.protocol.resolve_capabilities(server_capabilites)`
          Creates a normalized object describing capabilities from the server
          capabilities.

================================================================================
                                                                  *vim.lsp.util*

TODO: Describe the utils here for handling/applying things from LSP.

================================================================================
                                                               *lsp-buf-methods*
There are methods which operate on the buffer level for all of the active
clients attached to the buffer.

                                                         *vim.lsp.buf_request()*
vim.lsp.buf_request({bufnr}, {method}, {params}, [{callback}])
  Send a async request for all the clients active and attached to the buffer.

  Parameters: ~
    {bufnr}: The buffer handle or 0 for the current buffer.

    {method}: The LSP method name.

    {params}: The parameters to send.

    {callback}: An optional `function(err, method, params, client_id)` which
    will be called for this request. If you do not specify it, then it will
    use the client's callback in {client.callbacks}. See |lsp-callbacks| for
    more information.

  Returns:~

    A table from client id to the request id for all of the successful
    requests.

    The second result is a function which can be used to cancel all the
    requests. You can do this individually with `client.cancel_request()`

                                                    *vim.lsp.buf_request_sync()*
vim.lsp.buf_request_sync({bufnr}, {method}, {params}, [{timeout_ms}])
  Calls |vim.lsp.buf_request()|, but it will wait for the result and block Vim
  in the process.
  The parameters are the same as |vim.lsp.buf_request()|, but the return
  result is different.
  It will wait maximum of {timeout_ms} which defaults to 100ms.

  Returns:~

    If the timeout is exceeded or a cancel is sent or an error, it will cancel
    the request and return `nil, err` where `err` is a string that describes
    the reason why it failed.

    If it is successful, it will return a table from client id to result id.

                                                          *vim.lsp.buf_notify()*
vim.lsp.buf_notify({bufnr}, {method}, {params})
  Send a notification to all servers on the buffer.

  Parameters: ~
    {bufnr}: The buffer handle or 0 for the current buffer.

    {method}: The LSP method name.

    {params}: The parameters to send.

================================================================================
                                                                   *lsp-logging*

                                                       *vim.lsp.set_log_level()*
vim.lsp.set_log_level({level})
  You can set the log level for language server client logging.
  Possible values: "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error"

  Default: "warn"

  Example: `lua vim.lsp.set_log_level("debug")`

                                                        *vim.lsp.get_log_path()*
vim.lsp.get_log_path()
  Returns the path that LSP logs are written.

                                                            *vim.lsp.log_levels*
vim.lsp.log_levels
  Log level dictionary with reverse lookup as well.
 
  Can be used to lookup the number from the name or the name from the number.
  Levels by name: 'trace', 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error'
  Level numbers begin with 'trace' at 0

================================================================================
                                                                  *lsp-omnifunc*
                                                            *vim.lsp.omnifunc()*
vim.lsp.omnifunc({findstart}, {base})

To configure omnifunc, add the following in your init.vim:
>
  " Configure for python
  autocmd Filetype python setl omnifunc=v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc
  
  " Or with on_attach
  start_client {
    ...
    on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option(bufnr, 'omnifunc', 'v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc')
    end;
  }
  
  " This is optional, but you may find it useful
  autocmd CompleteDone * pclose

                                                             *lsp-vim-functions*

To use the functions from vim, it is recommended to use |v:lua| to interface
with the Lua functions. No direct vim functions are provided, but the
interface is still easy to use from mappings.

These methods can be used in mappings and are the equivalent of using the
request from lua as follows:

>
  " Example config
  autocmd Filetype rust,python,go,c,cpp setl omnifunc=v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc
  nnoremap <silent> ;dc <cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.declaration()<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> ;df <cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> ;h  <cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> ;i  <cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.implementation()<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> ;s  <cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> ;td <cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()<CR>
<
================================================================================
                                                       *lsp-advanced-js-example*

For more advanced configurations where just filtering by filetype isn't
sufficient, you can use the `vim.lsp.start_client()` and
`vim.lsp.buf_attach_client()` commands to easily customize the configuration
however you please. For example, if you want to do your own filtering, or
start a new LSP client based on the root directory for if you plan to work
with multiple projects in a single session. Below is a fully working Lua
example which can do exactly that.

The example will:
1. Check for each new buffer whether or not we want to start an LSP client.
2. Try to find a root directory by ascending from the buffer's path.
3. Create a new LSP for that root directory if one doesn't exist.
4. Attach the buffer to the client for that root directory.
