==============================================================================
1. Indenting C style programs				*C-indenting*

The basics for C style indenting are explained in section |30.2| of the user
manual.

Vim has options for automatically indenting C style program files. Many
programming languages including Java and C++ follow very closely the
formatting conventions established with C.  These options affect only the
indent and do not perform other formatting.  There are additional options that
affect other kinds of formatting as well as indenting, see |format-comments|,
|fo-table|, |gq| and |formatting| for the main ones.

There are in fact four main methods available for indentation, each one
overrides the previous if it is enabled, or non-empty for 'indentexpr':
'autoindent'	uses the indent from the previous line.
'smartindent'	is like 'autoindent' but also recognizes some C syntax to
		increase/reduce the indent where appropriate.
'cindent'	Works more cleverly than the other two and is configurable to
		different indenting styles.
'indentexpr'	The most flexible of all: Evaluates an expression to compute
		the indent of a line.  When non-empty this method overrides
		the other ones.  See |indent-expression|.
The rest of this section describes the 'cindent' option.

Note that 'cindent' indenting does not work for every code scenario.  Vim
is not a C compiler: it does not recognize all syntax.  One requirement is
that toplevel functions have a "{" in the first column.  Otherwise they are
easily confused with declarations.

These five options control C program indenting:
'cindent'	Enables Vim to perform C program indenting automatically.
'cinkeys'	Specifies which keys trigger reindenting in insert mode.
'cinoptions'	Sets your preferred indent style.
'cinwords'	Defines keywords that start an extra indent in the next line.
'cinscopedecls'	Defines strings that are recognized as a C++ scope declaration.

If 'lisp' is not on and 'equalprg' is empty, the "=" operator indents using
Vim's built-in algorithm rather than calling an external program.

See |autocommand| for how to set the 'cindent' option automatically for C code
files and reset it for others.

					*cinkeys-format* *indentkeys-format*
The 'cinkeys' option is a string that controls Vim's indenting in response to
typing certain characters or commands in certain contexts.  Note that this not
only triggers C-indenting.  When 'indentexpr' is not empty 'indentkeys' is
used instead.  The format of 'cinkeys' and 'indentkeys' is equal.

The default is "0{,0},0),0],:,0#,!^F,o,O,e" which specifies that indenting
occurs as follows:

	"0{"	if you type "{" as the first character in a line
	"0}"	if you type "}" as the first character in a line
	"0)"	if you type ")" as the first character in a line
	"0]"	if you type "]" as the first character in a line
	":"	if you type ":" after a label or case statement
	"0#"	if you type "#" as the first character in a line
	"!^F"	if you type CTRL-F (which is not inserted)
	"o"	if you type a <CR> anywhere or use the "o" command (not in
		insert mode!)
	"O"	if you use the "O" command (not in insert mode!)
	"e"	if you type the second 'e' for an "else" at the start of a
		line

Characters that can precede each key:				*i_CTRL-F*
!	When a "!" precedes the key, Vim will not insert the key but will
	instead reindent the current line.  This allows you to define a
	command key for reindenting the current line.  CTRL-F is the default
	key for this.  Be careful if you define CTRL-I for this because CTRL-I
	is the ASCII code for <Tab>.
*	When a "*" precedes the key, Vim will reindent the line before
	inserting the key.  If 'cinkeys' contains "*<Return>", Vim reindents
	the current line before opening a new line.
0	When a zero precedes the key (but appears after "!" or "*") Vim will
	reindent the line only if the key is the first character you type in
	the line.  When used before "=" Vim will only reindent the line if
	there is only white space before the word.

When neither "!" nor "*" precedes the key, Vim reindents the line after you
type the key.  So ";" sets the indentation of a line which includes the ";".

Special key names:
<>	Angle brackets mean spelled-out names of keys.  For example: "<Up>",
	"<Ins>" (see |key-notation|).
^	Letters preceded by a caret (^) are control characters.  For example:
	"^F" is CTRL-F.
o	Reindent a line when you use the "o" command or when Vim opens a new
	line below the current one (e.g., when you type <Enter> in insert
	mode).
O	Reindent a line when you use the "O" command.
e	Reindent a line that starts with "else" when you type the second 'e'.
:	Reindent a line when a ':' is typed which is after a label or case
	statement.  Don't reindent for a ":" in "class::method" for C++.  To
	Reindent for any ":", use "<:>".
=word	Reindent when typing the last character of "word".  "word" may
	actually be part of another word.  Thus "=end" would cause reindenting
	when typing the "d" in "endif" or "endwhile".  But not when typing
	"bend".  Also reindent when completion produces a word that starts
	with "word".  "0=word" reindents when there is only white space before
	the word.
=~word	Like =word, but ignore case.

If you really want to reindent when you type 'o', 'O', 'e', '0', '<', '>',
'*', ':' or '!', use "<o>", "<O>", "<e>", "<0>", "<<>", "<>>", "<*>", "<:>" or
"<!>", respectively, for those keys.

For an emacs-style indent mode where lines aren't indented every time you
press <Enter> but only if you press <Tab>, I suggest:
	:set cinkeys=0{,0},:,0#,!<Tab>,!^F
You might also want to switch off 'autoindent' then.

Note: If you change the current line's indentation manually, Vim ignores the
cindent settings for that line.  This prevents vim from reindenting after you
have changed the indent by typing <BS>, <Tab>, or <Space> in the indent or
used CTRL-T or CTRL-D.

						*cinoptions-values*
The 'cinoptions' option sets how Vim performs indentation.  The value after
the option character can be one of these (N is any number):
	N	indent N spaces
	-N	indent N spaces to the left
	Ns	N times 'shiftwidth' spaces
	-Ns	N times 'shiftwidth' spaces to the left

In the list below,
"N" represents a number of your choice (the number can be negative).  When
there is an 's' after the number, Vim multiplies the number by 'shiftwidth':
"1s" is 'shiftwidth', "2s" is two times 'shiftwidth', etc.  You can use a
decimal point, too: "-0.5s" is minus half a 'shiftwidth'.
The examples below assume a 'shiftwidth' of 4.
							*cino->*
	>N    Amount added for "normal" indent.  Used after a line that should
	      increase the indent (lines starting with "if", an opening brace,
	      etc.).  (default 'shiftwidth').

	eN    Add N to the prevailing indent inside a set of braces if the
	      opening brace at the End of the line (more precise: is not the
	      first character in a line).  This is useful if you want a
	      different indent when the "{" is at the start of the line from
	      when "{" is at the end of the line.  (default 0).

							*cino-n*
	nN    Add N to the prevailing indent for a statement after an "if",
	      "while", etc., if it is NOT inside a set of braces.  This is
	      useful if you want a different indent when there is no "{"
	      before the statement from when there is a "{" before it.
	      (default 0).

							*cino-f*
	fN    Place the first opening brace of a function or other block in
	      column N.  This applies only for an opening brace that is not
	      inside other braces and is at the start of the line.  What comes
	      after the brace is put relative to this brace.  (default 0).

<
							*cino-^*
	^N    Add N to the prevailing indent inside a set of braces if the
	      opening brace is in column 0.  This can specify a different
	      indent for whole of a function (some may like to set it to a
	      negative number).  (default 0).

		      }			}		  }
		  }		      }			  }
<
							*cino-L*
	LN    Controls placement of jump labels. If N is negative, the label
	      will be placed at column 1. If N is non-negative, the indent of
	      the label will be the prevailing indent minus N.  (default -1).

<
							*cino-g*
	gN    Place C++ scope declarations N characters from the indent of the

				*java-cinoptions* *java-indenting* *cino-j*
	jN    Indent Java anonymous classes correctly.  Also works well for

The defaults, spelled out in full, are:
	cinoptions=>s,e0,n0,f0,{0,}0,^0,L-1,:s,=s,l0,b0,gs,hs,N0,E0,ps,ts,is,+s,
			c3,C0,/0,(2s,us,U0,w0,W0,k0,m0,j0,J0,)20,*70,#0,P0

Vim puts a line in column 1 if:
- It starts with '#' (preprocessor directives), if 'cinkeys' contains '#0'.
- It starts with a label (a keyword followed by ':', other than "case" and
  "default") and 'cinoptions' does not contain an 'L' entry with a positive
  value.
- Any combination of indentations causes the line to have less than 0
  indentation.

==============================================================================
2. Indenting by expression				*indent-expression*

The basics for using flexible indenting are explained in section |30.3| of the
user manual.

If you want to write your own indent file, it must set the 'indentexpr'
option.  Setting the 'indentkeys' option is often useful.
See the $VIMRUNTIME/indent/README.txt file for hints.
See the $VIMRUNTIME/indent directory for examples.


REMARKS ABOUT SPECIFIC INDENT FILES ~


CLOJURE					*ft-clojure-indent* *clojure-indent*

Clojure indentation differs somewhat from traditional Lisps, due in part to
the use of square and curly brackets, and otherwise by community convention.
These conventions are not universally followed, so the Clojure indent script
offers a few configuration options.


							*g:clojure_maxlines*

Sets maximum scan distance of `searchpairpos()`.  Larger values trade
performance for correctness when dealing with very long forms.  A value of
0 will scan without limits.  The default is 300.


						*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent*
					*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns*
					*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist*

The 'lispwords' option is a list of comma-separated words that mark special
forms whose subforms should be indented with two spaces.

For example:
>
	(defn bad []
	      "Incorrect indentation")

	(defn good []
	  "Correct indentation")
<
If you would like to specify 'lispwords' with a |pattern| instead, you can use
the fuzzy indent feature:
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent = 1
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns = ['^with', '^def', '^let']
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist =
		\ ['-fn$', '\v^with-%(meta|out-str|loading-context)$']
<
|g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns| and |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist| are
lists of patterns that will be matched against the unqualified symbol at the
head of a list.  This means that a pattern like `"^foo"` will match all these
candidates: `foobar`, `my.ns/foobar`, and `#'foobar`.

Each candidate word is tested for special treatment in this order:

	1. Return true if word is literally in 'lispwords'
	2. Return false if word matches a pattern in
	   |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist|
	3. Return true if word matches a pattern in
	   |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns|
	4. Return false and indent normally otherwise


					*g:clojure_special_indent_words*

Some forms in Clojure are indented such that every subform is indented by only
two spaces, regardless of 'lispwords'.  If you have a custom construct that
should be indented in this idiosyncratic fashion, you can add your symbols to
the default list below.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_special_indent_words =
	   \ 'deftype,defrecord,reify,proxy,extend-type,extend-protocol,letfn'
<

					*g:clojure_align_multiline_strings*

Align subsequent lines in multi-line strings to the column after the opening
quote, instead of the same column.

For example:
>
	(def default
	  "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
	  eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
	  enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
	  nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.")

	(def aligned
	  "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
	   eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
	   enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
	   nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.")
<

						*g:clojure_align_subforms*

By default, parenthesized compound forms that look like function calls and
whose head subform is on its own line have subsequent subforms indented by
two spaces relative to the opening paren:
>
	(foo
	  bar
	  baz)
<
Setting this option to `1` changes this behaviour so that all subforms are
aligned to the same column, emulating the default behaviour of
clojure-mode.el:
>
	(foo
	 bar
	 baz)
<

FORTRAN							*ft-fortran-indent*

Block if, select case, where, and forall constructs are indented.  So are
type, interface, associate, block, and enum constructs.  The indenting of
subroutines, functions, modules, and program blocks is optional.  Comments,
labelled statements and continuation lines are indented if the Fortran is in
free source form, whereas they are not indented if the Fortran is in fixed
source form because of the left margin requirements.  Hence manual indent
corrections will be necessary for labelled statements and continuation lines
when fixed source form is being used.  For further discussion of the method
used for the detection of source format see |ft-fortran-syntax|.

Do loops ~
All do loops are left unindented by default.  Do loops can be unstructured in
Fortran with (possibly multiple) loops ending on a labelled executable
statement of almost arbitrary type.  Correct indentation requires
compiler-quality parsing.  Old code with do loops ending on labelled statements
of arbitrary type can be indented with elaborate programs such as Tidy
(https://www.unb.ca/chem/ajit/f_tidy.htm).  Structured do/continue loops are
also left unindented because continue statements are also used for purposes
other than ending a do loop.  Programs such as Tidy can convert structured
do/continue loops to the do/enddo form.  Do loops of the do/enddo variety can
be indented.  If you use only structured loops of the do/enddo form, you should
declare this by setting the fortran_do_enddo variable in your vimrc as
follows >

   let fortran_do_enddo=1

in which case do loops will be indented.  If all your loops are of do/enddo
type only in, say, .f90 files, then you should set a buffer flag with an
autocommand such as >

  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.f90 let b:fortran_do_enddo=1

to get do loops indented in .f90 files and left alone in Fortran files with
other extensions such as .for.

Program units ~
The indenting of program units (subroutines, functions, modules, and program
blocks) is enabled by default but can be suppressed if a lighter, screen-width
preserving indent style is desired.  To suppress the indenting of program
units for all fortran files set the global fortran_indent_less variable in
your vimrc as follows >

  let fortran_indent_less=1

A finer level of suppression can be achieved by setting the corresponding
buffer-local variable as follows >

  let b:fortran_indent_less=1


HTML				*ft-html-indent* *html-indent* *html-indenting*

This is about variables you can set in your vimrc to customize HTML indenting.

You can set the indent for the first line after <script> and <style>
"blocktags" (default "zero"): >

      :let g:html_indent_script1 = "inc"
      :let g:html_indent_style1 = "inc"
<
      VALUE	MEANING ~
      "zero"	zero indent
      "auto"	auto indent (same indent as the blocktag)
      "inc"	auto indent + one indent step

You can set the indent for attributes after an open <tag line: >

      :let g:html_indent_attribute = 1
<
      VALUE	MEANING ~
      1		auto indent, one indent step more than <tag
      2		auto indent, two indent steps (default)
      > 2	auto indent, more indent steps

Many tags increase the indent for what follows per default (see "Add Indent
Tags" in the script).  You can add further tags with: >

      :let g:html_indent_inctags = "html,body,head,tbody"

You can also remove such tags with: >

      :let g:html_indent_autotags = "th,td,tr,tfoot,thead"

Default value is empty for both variables.  Note: the initial "inctags" are
only defined once per Vim session.

User variables are only read when the script is sourced.  To enable your
changes during a session, without reloading the HTML file, you can manually
do: >

      :call HtmlIndent_CheckUserSettings()

Detail:
  Calculation of indent inside "blocktags" with "alien" content:
      BLOCKTAG   INDENT EXPR	    WHEN APPLICABLE ~
      <script> : {customizable}	    if first line of block
	       : cindent(v:lnum)    if attributes empty or contain "java"
	       : -1		    else (vbscript, tcl, ...)
      <style>  : {customizable}	    if first line of block
	       : GetCSSIndent()	    else
      <!-- --> : -1


MATLAB			*ft-matlab-indent* *matlab-indent* *matlab-indenting*

The setting Function indenting format in MATLAB Editor/Debugger Language
Preferences corresponds to: >
    :let g:MATLAB_function_indent = {0, 1 or 2 (default)}

Where 0 is for Classic, 1 for Indent nested functions and 2 for Indent all
functions.


PHP				*ft-php-indent* *php-indent* *php-indenting*

NOTE:	PHP files will be indented correctly only if PHP |syntax| is active.

If you are editing a file in Unix 'fileformat' and '\r' characters are present
before new lines, indentation won't proceed correctly ; you have to remove
those useless characters first with a command like: >

    :%s /\r$//g

Or, you can simply |:let| the variable PHP_removeCRwhenUnix to 1 and the
script will silently remove them when Vim loads a PHP file (at each |BufRead|).

OPTIONS: ~

PHP indenting can be altered in several ways by modifying the values of some
global variables:

					*php-comment* *PHP_autoformatcomment*
To not enable auto-formatting of comments by default (if you want to use your
own 'formatoptions'): >
    :let g:PHP_autoformatcomment = 0

Else, 't' will be removed from the 'formatoptions' string and "qrowcb" will be
added, see |fo-table| for more information.


							*PHP_outdentSLComments*
To add extra indentation to single-line comments: >
    :let g:PHP_outdentSLComments = N

With N being the number of 'shiftwidth' to add.

Only single-line comments will be affected such as: >
    # Comment
    // Comment
    /* Comment */
<

							*PHP_default_indenting*
To add extra indentation to every PHP lines with N being the number of
'shiftwidth' to add: >
    :let g:PHP_default_indenting = N

For example, with N = 1, this will give:
>
    <?php
	if (!isset($History_lst_sel))
	    if (!isset($History_lst_sel))
		if (!isset($History_lst_sel)) {
		    $History_lst_sel=0;
		} else
		    $foo="bar";

	$command_hist = TRUE;
    ?>
(Notice the extra indentation between the PHP container markers and the code)

							*PHP_outdentphpescape*
To indent PHP escape tags as the surrounding non-PHP code (only affects the
PHP escape tags): >
    :let g:PHP_outdentphpescape = 0
<

							*PHP_removeCRwhenUnix*
To automatically remove '\r' characters when the 'fileformat' is set to Unix: >
    :let g:PHP_removeCRwhenUnix = 1
<

							*PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel*
To indent braces at the same level than the code they contain: >
    :let g:PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel = 1

This will give the following result: >
    if ($foo)
	{
	foo();
	}
Instead of: >
    if ($foo)
    {
	foo();
    }

NOTE:	Indenting will be a bit slower if this option is used because some
	optimizations won't be available.

					*PHP_vintage_case_default_indent*
To indent 'case:' and 'default:' statements in switch() blocks: >
    :let g:PHP_vintage_case_default_indent = 1

In PHP braces are not required inside 'case/default' blocks therefore 'case:'
and 'default:' are indented at the same level than the 'switch()' to avoid
meaningless indentation. You can use the above option to return to the
traditional way.

							*PHP_noArrowMatching*
By default the indent script will indent multi-line chained calls by matching
the position of the '->': >

    $user_name_very_long->name()
                        ->age()
                        ->info();
<
You can revert to the classic way of indenting by setting this option to 1: >
    :let g:PHP_noArrowMatching = 1
<
You will obtain the following result: >

    $user_name_very_long->name()
        ->age()
        ->info();
<

					*PHP_IndentFunctionCallParameters*
Extra indentation levels to add to parameters in multi-line function calls. >
    let g:PHP_IndentFunctionCallParameters = 1

Function call arguments will indent 1 extra level. For two-space indentation: >

    function call_the_thing(
      $with_this,
      $and_that
    ) {
      $this->do_the_thing(
          $with_this,
          $and_that
      );
    }
<

				*PHP_IndentFunctionDeclarationParameters*
Extra indentation levels to add to arguments in multi-line function
definitions. >
    let g:PHP_IndentFunctionDeclarationParameters = 1
<
Function arguments in declarations will indent 1 extra level. For two-space
indentation: >

    function call_the_thing(
        $with_this,
        $and_that
    ) {
      $this->do_the_thing(
        $with_this,
        $and_that
      );
    }
<

PYTHON							*ft-python-indent*

The amount of indent can be set with the `g:python_indent` |Dictionary|, which
needs to be created before adding the items: >
	let g:python_indent = {}
The examples given are the defaults.  Note that the dictionary values are set
to an expression, so that you can change the value of 'shiftwidth' later
without having to update these values.

Indent after an open paren: >
	let g:python_indent.open_paren = 'shiftwidth() * 2'
Indent after a nested paren: >
	let g:python_indent.nested_paren = 'shiftwidth()'
Indent for a continuation line: >
	let g:python_indent.continue = 'shiftwidth() * 2'

By default, the closing paren on a multiline construct lines up under the first
non-whitespace character of the previous line.
If you prefer that it's lined up under the first character of the line that
starts the multiline construct, reset this key: >
	let g:python_indent.closed_paren_align_last_line = v:false

The method uses |searchpair()| to look back for unclosed parentheses.  This
can sometimes be slow, thus it timeouts after 150 msec.  If you notice the
indenting isn't correct, you can set a larger timeout in msec: >
	let g:python_indent.searchpair_timeout = 500

If looking back for unclosed parenthesis is still too slow, especially during
a copy-paste operation, or if you don't need indenting inside multi-line
parentheses, you can completely disable this feature: >
	let g:python_indent.disable_parentheses_indenting = 1

For backward compatibility, these variables are also supported: >
	g:pyindent_open_paren
	g:pyindent_nested_paren
	g:pyindent_continue
	g:pyindent_searchpair_timeout
	g:pyindent_disable_parentheses_indenting


R								*ft-r-indent*

Function arguments are aligned if they span for multiple lines. If you prefer
do not have the arguments of functions aligned, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_align_args = 0
<
All lines beginning with a comment character, #, get the same indentation
level of the normal R code. Users of Emacs/ESS may be used to have lines
beginning with a single # indented in the 40th column, ## indented as R code,
and ### not indented. If you prefer that lines beginning with comment
characters are aligned as they are by Emacs/ESS, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_comments = 1
<
If you prefer that lines beginning with a single # are aligned at a column
different from the 40th one, you should set a new value to the variable
r_indent_comment_column, as in the example below:
>
   let r_indent_comment_column = 30
<
Any code after a line that ends with "<-" is indented. Emacs/ESS does not
indent the code if it is a top level function. If you prefer that the
Vim-R-plugin behaves like Emacs/ESS in this regard, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_compatible = 1
<
Below is an example of indentation with and without this option enabled:
>
   ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 1           ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 0
   foo <-                                    foo <-
       function(x)                               function(x)
   {                                             {
       paste(x)                                      paste(x)
   }                                             }
<
The code will be indented after lines that match the pattern
`'\(&\||\|+\|-\|\*\|/\|=\|\~\|%\|->\)\s*$'`. If you want indentation after
lines that match a different pattern, you should set the appropriate value of
`r_indent_op_pattern` in your |vimrc|.


SHELL							*ft-sh-indent*

The amount of indent applied under various circumstances in a shell file can
be configured by setting the following keys in the |Dictionary|
b:sh_indent_defaults to a specific amount or to a |Funcref| that references a
function that will return the amount desired:

b:sh_indent_options['default']	Default amount of indent.

b:sh_indent_options['continuation-line']
				Amount of indent to add to a continued line.

b:sh_indent_options['case-labels']
				Amount of indent to add for case labels.
				(not actually implemented)

b:sh_indent_options['case-statements']
				Amount of indent to add for case statements.

b:sh_indent_options['case-breaks']
				Amount of indent to add (or more likely
				remove) for case breaks.

VERILOG							*ft-verilog-indent*

General block statements such as if, for, case, always, initial, function,
specify and begin, etc., are indented.  The module block statements (first
level blocks) are not indented by default.  you can turn on the indent with
setting a variable in the vimrc as follows: >

  let b:verilog_indent_modules = 1

then the module blocks will be indented.  To stop this, remove the variable: >

  :unlet b:verilog_indent_modules

To set the variable only for Verilog file.  The following statements can be
used: >

  au BufReadPost * if exists("b:current_syntax")
  au BufReadPost *   if b:current_syntax == "verilog"
  au BufReadPost *     let b:verilog_indent_modules = 1
  au BufReadPost *   endif
  au BufReadPost * endif

Furthermore, setting the variable b:verilog_indent_width to change the
indenting width (default is 'shiftwidth'): >

  let b:verilog_indent_width = 4
  let b:verilog_indent_width = shiftwidth() * 2

In addition, you can turn the verbose mode for debug issue: >

  let b:verilog_indent_verbose = 1

Make sure to do ":set cmdheight=2" first to allow the display of the message.


VHDL							*ft-vhdl-indent*

Alignment of generic/port mapping statements are performed by default. This
causes the following alignment example: >

  ENTITY sync IS
  PORT (
         clk        : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         reset_n    : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         data_input : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         data_out   : OUT STD_LOGIC
       );
  END ENTITY sync;

To turn this off, add >

  let g:vhdl_indent_genportmap = 0

to the vimrc file, which causes the previous alignment example to change: >

  ENTITY sync IS
  PORT (
    clk        : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    reset_n    : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    data_input : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    data_out   : OUT STD_LOGIC
  );
  END ENTITY sync;


Alignment of right-hand side assignment "<=" statements are performed by
default. This causes the following alignment example: >

  sig_out <= (bus_a(1) AND
             (sig_b OR sig_c)) OR
             (bus_a(0) AND sig_d);

To turn this off, add >

  let g:vhdl_indent_rhsassign = 0

to the vimrc file, which causes the previous alignment example to change: >

  sig_out <= (bus_a(1) AND
    (sig_b OR sig_c)) OR
    (bus_a(0) AND sig_d);


Full-line comments (lines that begin with "--") are indented to be aligned with
the very previous line's comment, PROVIDED that a whitespace follows after
"--".

For example: >

  sig_a <= sig_b; -- start of a comment
                  -- continuation of the comment
                  -- more of the same comment

While in Insert mode, after typing "-- " (note the space " "), hitting CTRL-F
will align the current "-- " with the previous line's "--".

If the very previous line does not contain "--", THEN the full-line comment
will be aligned with the start of the next non-blank line that is NOT a
full-line comment.

Indenting the following code: >

  sig_c <= sig_d; -- comment 0
         -- comment 1
               -- comment 2
    --debug_code:
    --PROCESS(debug_in)
         --BEGIN
            --  FOR i IN 15 DOWNTO 0 LOOP
             --    debug_out(8*i+7 DOWNTO 8*i) <= debug_in(15-i);
            --  END LOOP;
     --END PROCESS debug_code;

      -- comment 3
  sig_e <= sig_f; -- comment 4
           -- comment 5

results in: >

  sig_c <= sig_d; -- comment 0
                  -- comment 1
                  -- comment 2
  --debug_code:
  --PROCESS(debug_in)
  --BEGIN
  --  FOR i IN 15 DOWNTO 0 LOOP
  --    debug_out(8*i+7 DOWNTO 8*i) <= debug_in(15-i);
  --  END LOOP;
  --END PROCESS debug_code;

  -- comment 3
  sig_e <= sig_f; -- comment 4
                  -- comment 5

Notice that "--debug_code:" does not align with "-- comment 2"
because there is no whitespace that follows after "--" in "--debug_code:".

Given the dynamic nature of indenting comments, indenting should be done TWICE.
On the first pass, code will be indented. On the second pass, full-line
comments will be indented according to the correctly indented code.


VIM							*ft-vim-indent*
							*g:vim_indent_cont*
For indenting Vim scripts there is one variable that specifies the amount of
indent for a continuation line, a line that starts with a backslash: >

	:let g:vim_indent_cont = shiftwidth() * 3

Three times shiftwidth is the default value.


 vim:tw=78:ts=8:noet:ft=help:norl:
