==============================================================================
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES				*incompatible-6*

These changes are incompatible with previous releases.  Check this list if you
run into a problem when upgrading from Vim 5.x to 6.0


Cursor position in Visual mode			*curpos-visual*
------------------------------

When going from one window to another window on the same buffer while in
Visual mode, the cursor position of the other window is adjusted to keep the
same Visual area.  This can be used to set the start of the Visual area in one
window and the end in another.  In vim 5.x the cursor position of the other
window would be used, which could be anywhere and was not very useful.


Substitute command Vi compatible		*substitute-CR*
--------------------------------

The substitute string (the "to" part of the substitute command) has been made
Vi compatible.  Previously a CTRL-V had a special meaning and could be used to
prevent a <CR> to insert a line break.  This made it impossible to insert a
CTRL-V before a line break.  Now a backslash is used to prevent a <CR> to
cause a line break.  Since the number of backslashes is halved, it is still
possible to insert a line break at the end of the line.  This now works just
like Vi, but it's not compatible with Vim versions before 6.0.

When a ":s" command doesn't make any substitutions, it no longer sets the '[
and '] marks.  This is not related to Vi, since it doesn't have these marks.


Global option values introduced			*new-global-values*
-------------------------------

There are now global values for options which are local to a buffer or window.
Previously the local options were copied from one buffer to another.  When
editing another file this could cause option values from a modeline to be used
for the wrong file.  Now the global values are used when entering a buffer
that has not been used before.  Also, when editing another buffer in a window,
the local window options are reset to their global values.  The ":set" command
sets both the local and global values, this is still compatible.  But a
modeline only sets the local value, this is not backwards compatible.

":let &opt = val" now sets the local and global values, like ":set".  New
commands have been added to set the global or local value:
	:let &opt = val		like ":set"
	:let &g:opt = val	like ":setglobal"
	:let &l:opt = val	like ":setlocal"


'fileencoding' changed				*fileencoding-changed*
----------------------

'fileencoding' was used in Vim 5.x to set the encoding used inside all of Vim.
This was a bit strange, because it was local to a buffer and worked for all
buffers.  It could never be different between buffers, because it changed the
way text in all buffers was interpreted.
It is now used for the encoding of the file related to the buffer.  If you
still set 'fileencoding' it is likely to be overwritten by the detected
encoding from 'fileencodings', thus it is "mostly harmless".
The old FileEncoding autocommand now does the same as the new EncodingChanged
event.


Digraphs changed				*digraphs-changed*
----------------

The default digraphs now correspond to RFC1345.  This is very different from
what was used in Vim 5.x. |digraphs|


Filetype detection changed			*filetypedetect-changed*
--------------------------

The filetype detection previously was using the "filetype" autocommand group.
This caused confusion with the FileType event name (case is ignored).  The
group is now called "filetypedetect".  It still works, but if the "filetype"
group is used the autocommands will not be removed by ":filetype off".
   The support for 'runtimepath' has made the "myfiletypefile" and
"mysyntaxfile" mechanism obsolete.  They are still used for backwards
compatibility.

The connection between the FileType event and setting the 'syntax' option was
previously in the "syntax" autocommand group.  That caused confusion with the
Syntax event name.  The group is now called "syntaxset".

The distributed syntax files no longer contain "syntax clear".  That makes it
possible to include one in the other without tricks.  The syntax is now
cleared when the 'syntax' option is set (by an autocommand added from
synload.vim).  This makes the syntax cleared when the value of 'syntax' does
not correspond to a syntax file.  Previously the existing highlighting was
kept.


Unlisted buffers introduced			*new-unlisted-buffers*
---------------------------

There is now a difference between buffers which don't appear in the buffer
list and buffers which are really not in the buffer list.  Commands like
":ls", ":bnext", ":blast" and the Buffers menu will skip buffers not in the
buffer list. |unlisted-buffer|
The 'buflisted' option can be used to make a buffer appear in the buffer list
or not.

Several commands that previously added a buffer to the buffer list now create
an unlisted buffer.  This means that a ":bnext" and ":ball" will not find these
files until they have actually been edited.  For example, buffers used for the
alternative file by ":write file" and ":read file".
   Other commands previously completely deleted a buffer and now only remove
the buffer from the buffer list.  Commands relying on a buffer not to be
present might fail.  For example, a ":bdelete" command in an autocommand that
relied on something following to fail (was used in the automatic tests).
|:bwipeout| can be used for the old meaning of ":bdelete".

The BufDelete autocommand event is now triggered when a buffer is removed from
the buffer list.  The BufCreate event is only triggered when a buffer is
created that is added to the buffer list, or when an existing buffer is added
to the buffer list.  BufAdd is a new name for BufCreate.
The new BufNew event is for creating any buffer and BufWipeout for really
deleting a buffer.

When doing Insert mode completion, only buffers in the buffer list are
scanned.  Added the 'U' flag to 'complete' to do completion from unlisted
buffers.

Unlisted buffers are not stored in a viminfo file.


CTRL-U in Command-line mode changed		*CTRL-U-changed*
-----------------------------------

Using CTRL-U when editing the command line cleared the whole line.  Most
shells only delete the characters before the cursor.  Made it work like that.
(Steve Wall)

You can get the old behavior with CTRL-E CTRL-U: >
	:cnoremap <C-U> <C-E><C-U>


Ctags gone					*ctags-gone*
----------

Ctags is no longer part of the Vim distribution.  It's now a grown-up program
by itself, it deserves to be distributed separately.
Ctags can be found here: http://ctags.sf.net/.


Documentation reorganized			*documentation-6*
-------------------------

The documentation has been reorganized, an item may not be where you found it
in Vim 5.x.
- The user manual was added, some items have been moved to it from the
  reference manual.
- The quick reference is now in a separate file (so that it can be printed).

The examples in the documentation were previously marked with a ">" in the
first column.  This made it difficult to copy/paste them.  There is now a
single ">" before the example and it ends at a "<" or a non-blank in the first
column.  This also looks better without highlighting.

'helpfile' is no longer used to find the help tags file.  This allows a user
to add its own help files (e.g., for plugins).


Modeless selection and clipboard		*modeless-and-clipboard*
--------------------------------

The modeless selection is used to select text when Visual mode can't be used,
for example when editing the command line or at the more prompt.
In Vim 5.x the modeless selection was always used.  On MS-Windows this caused
the clipboard to be overwritten, with no way to avoid that.  The modeless
selection now obeys the 'a' and 'A' flags in 'guioptions' and "autoselect" and
"autoselectml" in 'clipboard'.  By default there is no automatic copy on
MS-Windows.  Use the |c_CTRL-Y| command to manually copy the selection.

To get the old behavior back, do this: >

	:set clipboard^=autoselectml guioptions+=A


Small incompatibilities				*incomp-small-6*
-----------------------

'backupdir', 'cdpath', 'directory', 'equalprg', 'errorfile', 'formatprg',
'grepprg', 'helpfile', 'makeef', 'makeprg', 'keywordprg', 'cscopeprg',
'viminfo' and 'runtimepath' can no longer be set from a modeline, for better
security.

Removed '_' from the 'breakat' default: It's commonly used in keywords.

The default for 'mousehide' is on, because this works well for most people.

The Amiga binary is now always compiled with "big" features.  The "big" binary
archive no longer exists.

The items "[RO]", "[+]", "[help]", "[Preview]" and "[filetype]" in
'statusline' no longer have a leading space.

Non-Unix systems: When expanding wildcards for the Vim arguments, don't use
'suffixes'.  It now works as if the shell had expanded the arguments.

The 'lisp', 'smartindent' and 'cindent' options are not switched off when
'paste' is set.  The auto-indenting is disabled when 'paste' is set, but
manual indenting with "=" still works.

When formatting with "=" uses 'cindent' or 'indentexpr' indenting, and there
is no change in indent, this is not counted as a change ('modified' isn't set
and there is nothing to undo).

Report 'modified' as changed when 'fileencoding' or 'fileformat' was set.
Thus it reflects the possibility to abandon the buffer without losing changes.

The "Save As" menu entry now edits the saved file.  Most people expect it to
work like this.

A buffer for a directory is no longer added to the Buffers menu.

Renamed <Return> to <Enter>, since that's what it's called on most keyboards.
Thus it's now the hit-enter prompt instead of the hit-return prompt.
Can map <Enter> just like <CR> or <Return>.

The default for the 'viminfo' option is now '20,"50,h when 'compatible' isn't
set.  Most people will want to use it, including beginners, but it required
setting the option, which isn't that easy.

After using ":colder" the newer error lists are overwritten.  This makes it
possible to use ":grep" to browse in a tree-like way.  Must use ":cnewer 99"
to get the old behavior.

The patterns in 'errorformat' would sometimes ignore case (MS-Windows) and
sometimes not (Unix).  Now case is always ignored.  Add "\C" to the pattern to
match case.

The 16 bit MS-DOS version is now compiled without the +listcmds feature
(buffer list manipulation commands).  They are not often needed and this
executable needs to be smaller.

'sessionoptions' now includes "curdir" by default.  This means that restoring
a session will result in the current directory being restored, instead of
going to the directory where the session file is located.

A session deleted all buffers, deleting all marks.  Now keep the buffer list,
it shouldn't hurt for some existing buffers to remain present.
When the argument list is empty ":argdel *" caused an error message.

No longer put the search pattern from a tag jump in the history.

Use "SpecialKey" highlighting for unprintable characters instead of "NonText".
The idea is that unprintable text or any text that's displayed differently
from the characters in the file is using "SpecialKey", and "NonText" is used
for text that doesn't really exist in the file.

Motif now uses the system default colors for the menu and scrollbar.  Used to
be grey.  It's still possible to set the colors with ":highlight" commands and
resources.

Formatting text with "gq" breaks a paragraph at a non-empty blank line.
Previously the line would be removed, which wasn't very useful.

":normal" does no longer hang when the argument ends in half a command.
Previously Vim would wait for more characters to be typed, without updating
the screen.  Now it pretends an <Esc> was typed.

Bitmaps for the toolbar are no longer searched for in "$VIM/bitmaps" but in
the "bitmaps" directories in 'runtimepath'.

Now use the Cmdline-mode menus for the hit-enter prompt instead of the Normal
mode menus.  This generally works better and allows using the "Copy" menu to
produce CTRL-Y to copy the modeless selection.

Moved the font selection from the Window to the Edit menu, together with the
other settings.

The default values for 'isfname' include more characters to make "gf" work
better.

Changed the license for the documentation to the Open Publication License.
This seemed fair, considering the inclusion of parts of the Vim book, which is
also published under the OPL.  The downside is that we can't force someone who
would sell copies of the manual to contribute to Uganda.

After  "ayy  don't let  ""yy  or  :let @" = val  overwrite the "a register.
Use the unnamed register instead.

MSDOS: A pattern "*.*" previously also matched a file name without a dot.
This was inconsistent with other versions.

In Insert mode, CTRL-O CTRL-\ CTRL-N {cmd} remains in Normal mode.  Previously
it would go back to Insert mode, thus confusing the meaning of CTRL-\ CTRL-N,
which is supposed to take us to Normal mode (especially in ":amenu").

Allow using ":" commands after an operator.  Could be used to implement a new
movement command.  Thus it no longer aborts a pending operator.

For the Amiga the "-d {device}" argument was possible.  When compiled with the
diff feature, this no longer works.  Use "-dev {device}" instead. |-dev|

Made the default mappings for <S-Insert> in Insert mode insert the text
literally, avoids that special characters like BS cause side effects.

Using ":confirm" applied to the rest of the line.  Now it applies only to the
command right after it.  Thus ":confirm if x | edit | endif" no longer works,
use ":if x | confirm edit | endif".  This was the original intention, that it
worked differently was a bug.

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES						*new-6*

Folding							*new-folding*
-------

Vim can now display a buffer with text folded.  This allows overviewing the
structure of a file quickly.  It is also possible to yank, delete and put
folded text, for example to move a function to another position.

There is a whole bunch of new commands and options related to folding.
See |folding|.


Vertically split windows				*new-vertsplit*
------------------------

Windows can also be split vertically.  This makes it possible to have windows
side by side.  One nice use for this is to compare two similar files (see
|new-diff-mode|).  The 'scrollbind' option can be used to synchronize
scrolling.

A vertical split can be created with the commands:
	:vsplit	  or  CTRL-W v  or CTRL-W CTRL-V	|:vsplit|
	:vnew						|:vnew|
	:vertical {cmd}					|:vertical|
The last one is a modifier, which has a meaning for any command that splits a
window.  For example: >
	:vertical stag main
Will vertically split the window and jump to the tag "main" in the new window.

Moving from window to window horizontally can be done with the |CTRL-W_h| and
|CTRL-W_l| commands.  The |CTRL-W_k| and |CTRL-W_j| commands have been changed
to jump to the window above or below the cursor position.

The vertical and horizontal splits can be mixed as you like.  Resizing windows
is easy when using the mouse, just position the pointer on a status line or
vertical separator and drag it.  In the GUI a special mouse pointer shape
indicates where you can drag a status or separator line.

To resize vertically split windows use the |CTRL-W_<| and |CTRL-W_>| commands.
To make a window the maximum width use the CTRL-W | command |CTRL-W_bar|.

To force a new window to use the full width or height of the Vim window,
these two modifiers are available:
	:topleft {cmd}		New window appears at the top with full
				width or at the left with full height.
	:botright {cmd}		New window appears at the bottom with full
				width or at the right with full height.
This can be combined with ":vertical" to force a vertical split: >
	:vert bot dsplit DEBUG
This will open a window at the far right, occupying the full height of the Vim
window, with the cursor on the first definition of "DEBUG".
The help window is opened at the top, like ":topleft" was used, if the current
window is fewer than 80 characters wide.

A few options can be used to set the preferences for vertically split windows.
They work similar to their existing horizontal equivalents:
	horizontal	vertical ~
	'splitbelow'	'splitright'
	'winheight'	'winwidth'
	'winminheight'	'winminwidth'
It's possible to set 'winminwidth' to zero, so that temporarily unused windows
hardly take up space without closing them.

The new 'eadirection' option tells where 'equalalways' applies:
	:set eadirection=both		both directions
	:set eadirection=ver		equalize window heights
	:set eadirection=hor		equalize windows widths
This can be used to avoid changing window sizes when you want to keep them.

Since windows can become quite narrow with vertical splits, text lines will
often not fit.  The 'sidescrolloff' has been added to keep some context left
and right of the cursor.  The 'listchars' option has been extended with the
"precedes" item, to show a "<" for example, when there is text left off the
screen. (Utz-Uwe Haus)

"-O" command line argument: Like "-o" but split windows vertically. (Scott
Urban)

Added commands to move the current window to the very top (CTRL-W K), bottom
(CTRL-W J), left (CTRL-W H) and right (CTRL-W L).  In the new position the
window uses the full width/height of the screen.

When there is not enough room in the status line for both the file name and
the ruler, use up to half the width for the ruler.  Useful for narrow windows.


Diff mode						*new-diff-mode*
---------

In diff mode Vim shows the differences between two, three or four files.
Folding is used to hide the parts of the file that are equal.
Highlighting is used to show deleted and changed lines.
See |diff-mode|.

An easy way to start in diff mode is to start Vim as "vimdiff file1 file2".
Added the vimdiff manpage.

In a running Vim the |:diffsplit| command starts diff mode for the current
file and another file.  The |:diffpatch| command starts diff mode using the
current file and a patch file.  The |:diffthis| command starts diff mode for
the current window.

Differences can be removed with the |:diffget| and |:diffput| commands.

- The 'diff' option switches diff mode on in a window.
- The |:diffupdate| command refreshes the diffs.
- The 'diffopt' option changes how diffs are displayed.
- The 'diffexpr' option can be set how a diff is to be created.
- The 'patchexpr' option can be set how patch is applied to a file.
- Added the "diff" folding method.  When opening a window for diff-mode, set
  'foldlevel' to zero and 'foldenable' on, to close the folds.
- Added the DiffAdd, DiffChange, DiffDelete and DiffText highlight groups to
  specify the highlighting for differences.  The defaults are ugly...
- Unix: make a vimdiff symbolic link for "make install".
- Removed the now obsolete "vimdiff.vim" script from the distribution.
- Added the "[c" and "]c" commands to move to the next/previous change in diff
  mode.


Easy Vim: click-and-type				*new-evim*
------------------------

eVim stands for "Easy Vim".  This is a separate program, but can also be
started as "vim -y".

This starts Vim with 'insertmode' set to allow click-and-type editing.  The
$VIMRUNTIME/evim.vim script is used to add mappings and set options to be able
to do most things like Notepad.  This is only for people who can't stand two
modes.

eView does the same but in readonly mode.

In the GUI a CTRL-C now only interrupts when busy with something, not when
waiting for a character.  Allows using CTRL-C to copy text to the clipboard.


User manual						*new-user-manual*
-----------

The user manual has been added.  It is organised around editing tasks.  It
reads like a book, from start to end.  It should allow beginners to start
learning Vim.  It helps everybody to learn using the most useful Vim features.
It is much easier to read than the reference manual, but omits details.  See
|user-manual|.

The user manual includes parts of the Vim book by Steve Oualline |frombook|.
It is published under the OPL |manual-copyright|.

When syntax highlighting is not enabled, the characters in the help file which
mark examples ('>' and '<') and header lines ('~') are replaced with a space.

When closing the help window, the window layout is restored from before
opening it, if the window layout didn't change since then.
When opening the help window, put it at the top of the Vim window if the
current window is fewer than 80 characters and not full width.


Flexible indenting					*new-indent-flex*
------------------

Automatic indenting is now possible for any language.  It works with a Vim
script, which makes it very flexible to compute the indent.

The ":filetype indent on" command enables using the provided indent scripts.
This is explained in the user manual: |30.3|.

The 'indentexpr' option is evaluated to get the indent for a line.  The
'indentkeys' option tells when to trigger re-indenting.  Normally these
options are set from an indent script.  Like Syntax files, indent scripts will
be created and maintained by many people.


Extended search patterns				*new-searchpat*
------------------------

Added the possibility to match more than one line with a pattern. (partly by
Loic Grenie)
New items in a search pattern for multi-line matches:
\n		match end-of-line, also in []
\_[]		match characters in range and end-of-line
\_x		match character class and end-of-line
\_.		match any character or end-of-line
\_^		match start-of-line, can be used anywhere in the regexp
\_$		match end-of-line, can be used anywhere in the regexp

Various other new items in search patterns:
\c		ignore case for the whole pattern
\C		match case for the whole pattern
\m		magic on for the following
\M		magic off for the following
\v		make following characters "very magic"
\V		make following characters "very nomagic"

\@!		don't match atom before this.
		Example: "foo\(bar\)\@!" matches "foo " but not "foobar".
\@=		match atom, resulting in  zero-width match
		Example: "foo\(bar\)\@=" matches "foo" in "foobar".
\@<!		don't match preceding atom before the current position
\@<=		match preceding atom before the current position
\@>		match preceding atom as a subexpression

\&		match only when branch before and after it match

\%[]		optionally match a list of atoms; "end\%[if]" matches "end",
		"endi" and "endif"
\%(\)		like \(\), but without creating a back-reference; there can be
		any number of these, overcomes the limit of nine \( \) pairs
\%^		match start-of-file (Chase Tingley)
\%$		match end-of-file (Chase Tingley)
\%#		Match with the cursor position. (Chase Tingley)
\?		Just like "\=" but can't be used in a "?" command.

\%23l		match in line 23
\%<23l		match before line 23
\%>23l		match after line 23
\%23c, \%<23c, \%>23c   match in/before/after column 23
\%23v, \%<23v, \%>23v	match in/before/after virtual column 23


For syntax items:
\z(...\)	external reference match set (in region start pattern)
\z1 - \z9	external reference match use (in region skip or end pattern)
	(Scott Bigham)

\zs		use position as start of match
\ze		use position as end of match

Removed limit of matching only up to 32767 times with *, \+, etc.

Added support to match multi-byte characters. (partly by Muraoka Taro)
Made "\<" and "\>" work for UTF-8. (Muraoka Taro)


UTF-8 support						*new-utf-8*
-------------

Vim can now edit files in UTF-8 encoding.  Up to 31 bit characters can be
used, but only 16 bit characters are displayed.  Up to two combining
characters are supported, they overprint the preceding character.
Double-wide characters are also supported.  See |UTF-8|.

UCS-2, UCS-4 and UTF-16 encodings are supported too, they are converted to
UTF-8 internally.  There is also support for editing Unicode files in a Latin1
environment.  Other encodings are converted with iconv() or an external
converter specified with 'charconvert'.

Many new items for Multi-byte support:
- Added 'encoding' option: specifies character encoding used inside Vim.  It
  can be any 8-bit encoding, some double-byte encodings or Unicode.
  It is initialized from the environment when a supported value is found.
- Added 'fileencoding' and 'fileencodings': specify character coding in a
  file, similar to 'fileformat' and 'fileformats'.
  When 'encoding' is "utf-8" and 'fileencodings' is "utf-8,latin1" this will
  automatically switch to latin1 if a file does not contain valid UTF-8.
- Added 'bomb' option and detection of a BOM at the start of a file.  Can be
  used with "ucs-bom" in 'fileencodings' to automatically detect a Unicode
  file if it starts with a BOM.  Especially useful on MS-Windows (NT and
  2000), which uses ucs-2le files with a BOM (e.g., when exporting the
  registry).
- Added the 'termencoding' option: Specifies the encoding used for the
  terminal.  Useful to put Vim in utf-8 mode while in a non-Unicode locale: >
    :let &termencoding = &encoding
    :set encoding=utf-8
- When 'viminfo' contains the 'c' flag, the viminfo file is converted from the
  'encoding' it was written with to the current 'encoding'.
- Added ":scriptencoding" command: convert lines in a sourced script to
  'encoding'.  Useful for menu files.
- Added 'guifontwide' to specify a font for double-wide characters.
- Added Korean support for character class detection.  Also fix cls() in
  search.c. (Chong-Dae Park)
- Win32: Typing multi-byte characters without IME. (Alexander Smishlajev)
- Win32 with Mingw: compile with iconv library. (Ron Aaron)
- Win32 with MSVC: dynamically load iconv.dll library. (Muraoka Taro)
- Make it possible to build a version with multi-byte and iconv support with
  Borland 5.5.  (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
- Added 'delcombine' option: Delete combining character separately. (Ron
  Aaron)
- The "xfontset" feature isn't required for "xim".  These are now two
  independent features.
- XIM: enable XIM when typing a language character (Insert mode, Search
  pattern, "f" or "r" command).  Disable XIM when typing a Normal mode
  command.
- When the XIM is active, show "XIM" in the 'showmode' message. (Nam SungHyun)
- Support "CursorIM" for XIM.  (Nam SungHyun)
- Added 'm' flag to 'formatoptions': When wrapping words, allow splitting at
  each multibyte character, not only at a space.
- Made ":syntax keyword" work with multi-byte characters.
- Added support for Unicode upper/lowercase flipping and comparing. (based on
  patch by Raphael Finkel)
  Let "~" on multi-byte characters that have a third case ("title case")
  switch between the three cases. (Raphael Finkel)

Allow defining digraphs for multi-byte characters.
Added RFC1345 digraphs for Unicode.
Most Normal mode commands that accept a character argument, like "r", "t" and
"f" now accept a digraph.  The 'D' flag in 'cpoptions' disables this to remain
Vi compatible.

Added Language mapping and 'keymap' to be able to type multi-byte characters:
- Added the ":lmap" command and friends: Define mappings that are used when
  typing characters in the language of the text.  Also for "r", "t", etc.  In
  Insert and Command-line mode CTRL-^ switches the use of the mappings on/off.
  CTRL-^ also toggles the use of an input method when no language mappings are
  present.  Allows switching the IM back on halfway typing.
- "<char-123>" argument to ":map", allows to specify the decimal, octal or
  hexadecimal value of a character.
- Implemented the 'keymap' option: Load a keymap file.  Uses ":lnoremap" to
  define mappings for the keymap.  The new ":loadkeymap" command is used in
  the keymap file.
- Added 'k' flag in 'statusline': Value of "b:keymap_name" or 'keymap' when
  it's being used.  Uses "<lang>" when no keymap is loaded and ":lmap"s are
  active.  Show this text in the default statusline too.
- Added the 'iminsert' and 'imsearch' options: Specify use of langmap mappings
  and Input Method with an option. (Muraoka Taro)
  Added 'imcmdline' option: When set the input method is always enabled when
  starting to edit a command line.  Useful for a XIM that uses dead keys to
  type accented characters.
  Added 'imactivatekey' option to better control XIM.  (Muraoka Taro)
- When typing a mapping that's not finished yet, display the last character
  under the cursor in Insert mode and Command-line mode.  Looks good for dead
  characters.
- Made the 'langmap' option recognize multi-byte characters.  But mapping only
  works for 8-bit characters.  Helps when using UTF-8.
- Use a different cursor for when ":lmap" mappings are active.  Can specify
  two highlight groups for an item in 'guicursor'.  By default "lCursor" and
  "Cursor" are equal, the user must set a color he likes.
  Use the cursor color for hangul input as well. (Sung-Hyun Nam)
- Show "(lang)" for 'showmode' when language mapping is enabled.
- UTF-8: Made "r" work with a ":lmap" that includes a composing character.
  Also works for "f", which now works to find a character that includes a
  composing character.

Other multi-byte character additions:
- Support double-byte single-width characters for euc-jp: Characters starting
  with 0x8E.  Added ScreenLines2[] to store the second byte.


Multi-language support					*new-multi-lang*
----------------------

The messages used in Vim can be translated.  Several translations are
available.  This uses the gettext mechanism.  It allows adding a translation
without recompiling Vim.  |multi-lang| (partly by Marcin Dalecki)

The translation files are in the src/po directory.  The src/po/README.txt file
explains a few things about doing a translation.

Menu translations are available as well.  This uses the new |:menutranslate|
command.  The translations are found in the runtime directory "lang".  This
allows a user to add a translation.

Added |:language| command to set the language (locale) for messages, time and
character type.  This allows switching languages in Vim without changing the
locale outside of Vim.

Made it possible to have vimtutor use different languages.  (Eduardo Fernandez)
Spanish (Eduardo Fernandez), Italian (Antonio Colombo), Japanese (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto) and French (Adrien Beau) translations are included.
Added "vimtutor.bat": script to start Vim on a copy of the tutor file for
MS-Windows. (Dan Sharp)

- Added v:lang variable to be able to get current language setting.
  (Marcin Dalecki)  Also v:lc_time and v:ctype.
- Make it possible to translate the dialogs used by the menus.  Uses global
  "menutrans_" variables.  ":menutrans clear" deletes them.
- removed "broken locale" (Marcin Dalecki).
- Don't use color names in icons, use RGB values.  The names could be
  translated.
- Win32: Added global IME support (Muraoka)
- Win32: Added dynamic loading of IME support.
- ":messages" prints a message about who maintains the messages or the
  translations.  Useful to find out where to make a remark about a wrong
  translation.
- --disable-nls argument for configure: Disable use of gettext(). (Sung-Hyun
  Nam)
- Added NLS support for Win32 with the MingW compiler. (Eduardo Fernandez)
- When available, call bind_textdomain_codeset() to have gettext() translate
  messages to 'encoding'.  This requires GNU gettext 0.10.36 or later.
- Added gettext support for Win32.  This means messages will be translated
  when the locale is set and libintl.dll can be found.  (Muraoka Taro)
  Also made it work with MingW compiler.  (Eduardo Fernandez)
  Detect the language and set $LANG to get the appropriate translated messages
  (if supported).  Also use $LANG to select a language, v:lang is a very
  different kind of name.
- Made gvimext.dll use translated messages, if possible. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)


Plugin support					*new-plugins*
--------------

To make it really easy to load a Vim script when starting Vim, the "plugin"
runtime directory can be used.  All "*.vim" files in it will be automatically
loaded.  For Unix, the directory "~/.vim/plugin" is used by default.  The
'runtimepath' option can be set to look in other directories for plugins.
|load-plugins| |add-plugin|

The |:runtime| command has been added to load one or more files in
'runtimepath'.

Standard plugins:
netrw.vim - Edit files over a network |new-network-files|
gzip.vim - Edit compressed files
explorer.vim - Browse directories |new-file-browser|

Added support for local help files. |add-local-help|.
When searching for help tags, all "doc/tags" files in 'runtimepath' are used.
Added the ":helptags" command: Generate a tags file for a help directory.
The first line of each help file is automagically added to the "LOCAL
ADDITIONS" section in doc/help.txt.

Added the <unique> argument to ":map": only add a mapping when it wasn't
defined before.

When displaying an option value with 'verbose' set will give a message about
where the option was last set.  Very useful to find out which script did set
the value.

The new |:scriptnames| command displays a list of all scripts that have been
sourced.

GUI: For Athena, Motif and GTK look for a toolbar bitmap in the "bitmaps"
directories in 'runtimepath'.  Allows adding your own bitmaps.


Filetype plugins				*new-filetype-plugins*
-----------------

A new group of files has been added to do settings for specific file types.
These can be options and mappings which are specifically used for one value of
'filetype'.

The files are located in "$VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin".  The 'runtimepath' option
makes it possible to use several sets of plugins: Your own, system-wide,
included in the Vim distribution, etc.

To be able to make this work, several features were added:
- Added the "s:" variables, local to a script.  Avoids name conflicts with
  global variables.  They can be used in the script and in functions,
  autocommands and user commands defined in the script.  They are kept between
  invocations of the same script.  |s:var|
- Added the global value for local options.  This value is used when opening
  a new buffer or editing another file.  The option value specified in a
  modeline or filetype setting is not carried over to another buffer.
  ":set" sets both the local and the global value.
  ":setlocal" sets the local option value only.
  ":setglobal" sets or displays the global value for a local option.
  ":setlocal name<" sets a local option to its global value.
- Added the buffer-local value for some global options: 'equalprg', 'makeprg',
  'errorformat', 'grepprg', 'path', 'dictionary', 'thesaurus', 'tags',
  'include' and 'define'.  This allows setting a local value for these global
  options, without making it incompatible.
- Added mappings and abbreviations local to a buffer: ":map <buffer>".
- In a mapping "<Leader>" can be used to get the value of the "mapleader"
  variable.  This simplifies mappings that use "mapleader".  "<Leader>"
  defaults to "\".  "<LocalLeader>" does the same with "maplocalleader".  This
  is to be used for mappings local to a buffer.
- Added <SID> Script ID to define functions and mappings local to a script.
- Added <script> argument to ":noremap" and ":noremenu": Only remap
  script-local mappings.  Avoids that mappings from other scripts get in the
  way, but does allow using mappings defined in the script.
- User commands can be local to a buffer: ":command -buffer".

The new ":setfiletype" command is used in the filetype detection autocommands,
to avoid that 'filetype' is set twice.


File browser						*new-file-browser*
------------

When editing a directory, the explorer plugin will list the files in the
directory.  Pressing <Enter> on a file name edits that file.  Pressing <Enter>
on a directory moves the browser to that directory.

There are several other possibilities, such as opening a file in the preview
window, renaming files and deleting files.


Editing files over a network				*new-network-files*
----------------------------

Files starting with scp://, rcp://, ftp:// and http:// are recognized as
remote files.  An attempt is made to access these files with the indicated
method.  For http:// only reading is possible, for the others writing is also
supported.  Uses the netrw.vim script as a standard "plugin". |netrw|

Made "gf" work on a URL.  It no longer assumes the file is local on the
computer (mostly didn't work anyway, because the full path was required).
Adjusted test2 for this.

Allow using a URL in 'path'.  Makes ":find index.html" work.

GTK: Allow dropping a http:// and ftp:// URL on Vim.  The netrw plugin takes
care of downloading the file. (MiKael Berthe)


Window for command-line editing				*new-cmdwin*
-------------------------------

The Command-line window can be used to edit a command-line with Normal and
Insert mode commands.  When it is opened it contains the history.  This allows
copying parts of previous command lines. |cmdwin|

The command-line window can be opened from the command-line with the key
specified by the 'cedit' option (like Nvi).  It can also be opened directly
from Normal mode with "q:", "q/" and "q?".

The 'cmdwinheight' is used to specify the initial height of the window.

In Insert mode CTRL-X CTRL-V can be used to complete an Ex command line, like
it's done on the command-line.  This is also useful for writing Vim scripts!

Additionally, there is "improved Ex mode".  Entered when Vim is started as
"exim" or "vim -E", and with the "gQ" command.  Works like repeated use of
":", with full command-line editing and completion. (Ulf Carlsson)


Debugging mode						*new-debug-mode*
--------------

In debugging mode sourced scripts and user functions can be executed line by
line.  There are commands to step over a command or step into it. |debug-mode|

Breakpoints can be set to run until a certain line in a script or user
function is executed. |:breakadd|

Debugging can be started with ":debug {cmd}" to debug what happens when a
command executes.  The |-D| argument can be used to debug while starting up.


Cursor in virtual position				*new-virtedit*
--------------------------

Added the 'virtualedit' option: Allow positioning the cursor where there is no
actual character in Insert mode, Visual mode or always. (Matthias Kramm)
This is especially useful in Visual-block mode.  It allows positioning a
corner of the area where there is no text character.  (Many improvements by
Chase Tingley)


Debugger interface					*new-debug-itf*
------------------

This was originally made to work with Sun Visual Workshop. (Gordon Prieur)
See |debugger.txt|, |sign.txt| and |workshop.txt|.

Added the ":sign" command to define and place signs.  They can be displayed
with two ASCII characters or an icon.  The line after it can be highlighted.
Useful to display breakpoints and the current PC position.

Added the |:wsverb| command to execute debugger commands.

Added balloon stuff: 'balloondelay' and 'ballooneval' options.

Added "icon=" argument for ":menu".  Allows defining a specific icon for a
ToolBar item.


Communication between Vims				*new-vim-server*
--------------------------

Added communication between two Vims.  Makes it possible to send commands from
one Vim to another.  Works for X-Windows and MS-Windows |clientserver|.

Use "--remote" to have files be edited in an already running Vim.
Use "--remote-wait" to do the same and wait for the editing to finish.
Use "--remote-send" to send commands from one Vim to another.
Use "--remote-expr" to have an expression evaluated in another Vim.
Use "--serverlist" to list the currently available Vim servers.  (X only)
There are also functions to communicate between the server and the client.
|remote_send()| |remote_expr()|

(X-windows version implemented by Flemming Madsen, MS-Windows version by Paul
Moore)

Added the command server name to the window title, so you can see which server
name belongs to which Vim.

Removed the OleVim directory and SendToVim.exe and EditWithVim.exe from the
distribution.  Can now use "gvim --remote" and "gvim --remote-send", which is
portable.

GTK+: Support running Vim inside another window.  Uses the --socketid argument
(Neil Bird)


Buffer type options					*new-buftype*
-------------------

The 'buftype' and 'bufhidden' options have been added.  They can be set to
have different kinds of buffers.  For example:
- 'buftype' = "quickfix": buffer with error list
- 'buftype' = "nofile" and 'bufhidden' = "delete": scratch buffer that will be
  deleted as soon as there is no window displaying it.

'bufhidden' can be used to overrule the 'hidden' option for one buffer.

In combination with 'buflisted' and 'swapfile' this offers the possibility to
use various kinds of special buffers.  See |special-buffers|.


Printing						*new-printing*
--------

Included first implementation of the ":hardcopy" command for printing
to paper.  For MS-Windows any installed printer can be used.  For other
systems a PostScript file is generated, which can be printed with the
'printexpr' option.
(MS-Windows part by Vince Negri, Vipin Aravind, PostScript by Vince Negri and
Mike Williams)

Made ":hardcopy" work with multi-byte characters. (Muraoka Taro, Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

Added options to tune the way printing works: (Vince Negri)
- 'printoptions' defines various things.
- 'printheader' specifies the header format.  Added "N" field to 'statusline'
  for the page number.
- 'printfont' specifies the font name and attributes.
- 'printdevice' defines the default printer for ":hardcopy!".


Ports							*ports-6*
-----

Port to OS/390 Unix (Ralf Schandl)
- A lot of changes to handle EBCDIC encoding.
- Changed Ctrl('x') to Ctrl_x define.

Included jsbmouse support. (Darren Garth)
Support for dec mouse in Unix. (Steve Wall)

Port to 16-bit MS Windows (Windows 3.1x) (Vince Negri)

Port to QNX.  Supports the Photon GUI, mouse, etc. (Julian Kinraid)

Allow cross-compiling the Win32 version with Make_ming.mak. (Ron Aaron)
Added Python support for compiling with Mingw. (Ron Aaron)

Dos 32 bit: Added support the Windows clipboard. (David Kotchan)

Win32: Dynamically load Perl and Python.  Allows compiling Vim with these
interfaces and will try to find the DLLs at runtime. (Muraoka Taro)

Compiling the Win32 GUI with Cygwin.  Also compile vimrun, dosinst and
uninstall.  (Gerfried)

Mac: Make Vim compile with the free MPW compiler supplied by Apple.  And
updates for CodeWarrior. (Axel Kielhorn)

Added typecasts and ifdefs as a start to make Vim work on Win64 (George
Reilly)


Quickfix extended					*quickfix-6*
-----------------

Added the "error window".  It contains all the errors of the current error
list.  Pressing <Enter> in a line makes Vim jump to that line (in another
window).  This makes it easy to navigate through the error list.
|quickfix-window|.

- |:copen| opens the quickfix window.
- |:cclose| closes the quickfix window.
- |:cwindow| takes care that there is a quickfix window only when there are
  recognized errors. (Dan Sharp)

- Quickfix also knows "info", next to "warning" and "error" types.  "%I" can be
  used for the start of a multi-line informational message. (Tony Leneis)
- The "%p" argument can be used in 'errorformat' to get the column number from
  a line where "^" points to the column. (Stefan Roemer)
- When using "%f" in 'errorformat' on a DOS/Windows system, also include "c:"
  in the filename, even when using "%f:".


Operator modifiers					*new-operator-mod*
------------------

Insert "v", "V" or CTRL-V between an operator and a motion command to force
the operator to work characterwise, linewise or blockwise. |o_v|


Search Path						*new-search-path*
-----------

Vim can search in a directory tree not only in downwards but also upwards.
Works for the 'path', 'cdpath' and 'tags' options. (Ralf Schandl)

Also use "**" for 'tags' option. (Ralf Schandl)

Added 'includeexpr', can be used to modify file name found by 'include'
option.
Also use 'includeexpr' for "gf" and "<cfile>" when the file can't be found
without modification.  Useful for doing "gf" on the name after an include or
import statement.

Added the 'cdpath' option: Locations to find a ":cd" argument. (Raf)

Added the 'suffixesadd' option: Suffixes to be added to a file name when
searching for a file for the "gf", "[I", etc. commands.


Writing files improved					*new-file-writing*
----------------------

Added the 'backupcopy' option: Select whether a file is to be copied or
renamed to make a backup file.  Useful on Unix to speed up writing an ordinary
file.  Useful on other systems to preserve file attributes and when editing a
file on a Unix filesystem.

Added the 'autowriteall' option.  Works like 'autowrite' but for more
commands.

Added the 'backupskip' option: A list of file patterns to skip making a backup
file when it matches.  The default for Unix includes "/tmp/*", this makes
"crontab -e" work.

Added support for Access Control Lists (ACL) for FreeBSD and Win32.  The ACL
is copied from the original file to the new file (or the backup if it's
copied).
ACL is also supported for AIX, Solaris and generic POSIX. (Tomas Ogren)
And on SGI.


Argument list						*new-argument-list*
-------------

The support for the argument list has been extended.  It can now be
manipulated to contain the files you want it to contain.

The argument list can now be local to a window.  It is created with the
|:arglocal| command.  The |:argglobal| command can be used to go back to the
global argument list.

The |:argdo| command executes a command on all files in the argument list.

File names can be added to the argument list with |:argadd|.  File names can
be removed with |:argdelete|.

"##" can be used like "#", it is replaced by all the names in the argument
list concatenated.  Useful for ":grep foo ##".

The |:argedit| adds a file to the argument list and edits it.  Like ":argadd"
and then ":edit".


Restore a View						*new-View*
--------------

The ":mkview" command writes a Vim script with the settings and mappings for
one window.  When the created file is sourced, the view of the window is
restored.  It's like ":mksession" for one window.
The View also contains the local argument list and manually created, opened
and closed folds.

Added the ":loadview" command and the 'viewdir' option: Allows for saving and
restoring views of a file with simple commands.  ":mkview 1" saves view 1 for
the current file, ":loadview 1" loads it again.  Also allows quickly switching
between two views on one file.  And saving and restoring manual folds and the
folding state.

Added 'viewoptions' to specify how ":mkview" works.

":mksession" now also works fine with vertical splits.  It has been further
improved and restores the view of each window.  It also works properly with
preview and quickfix windows.

'sessionoptions' is used for ":mkview" as well.
Added "curdir" and "sesdir" to 'sessionoptions'.  Allows selection of what
the current directory will be restored to.

The session file now also contains the argument list(s).


Color schemes						*new-color-schemes*
-------------

Support for loading a color scheme.  Added the ":colorscheme" command.
Automatically add menu entries for available schemes.
Should now properly reset the colors when 'background' or 't_Co' is changed.
":highlight clear" sets the default colors again.
":syntax reset" sets the syntax highlight colors back to the defaults.
For ":set bg&" guess the value.  This allows a color scheme to switch back to
the default colors.
When syntax highlighting is switched on and a color scheme was defined, reload
the color scheme to define the colors.


Various new items					*new-items-6*
-----------------

Normal mode commands: ~

"gi"		Jump to the ^ mark and start Insert mode.  Also works when the
		mark is just after the line. |gi|

"g'm" and "g`m"
		Jump to a mark without changing the jumplist.  Now you can use
		g`" to jump to the last known position in a file without side
		effects.  Also useful in mappings.

[', [`, ]' and ]`
		move the cursor to the next/previous lowercase mark.

g_		Go to last non-blank in line. (Steve Wall)


Options: ~

'autoread'	When detected that a file changed outside of Vim,
		automatically read a buffer again when it's not changed.
		It has a global and a local value.  Use ":setlocal autoread<"
		to go back to using the global value for 'autoread'.

'debug'		When set to "msg" it will print error messages that would
		otherwise be omitted.  Useful for debugging 'indentexpr' and
		'foldexpr'.

'lispwords'	List of words used for lisp indenting.  It was previously hard
		coded.  Added a number of Lisp names to the default.

'fold...'	Many new options for folding.

'modifiable'	When off, it is impossible to make changes to a buffer.
		The %m and %M items in 'statusline' show a '-'.

'previewwindow' Set in the preview window.  Used in a session file to mark a
		window as the preview window.

'printfont'
'printexpr'
'printheader'
'printdevice'
'printoptions'	for ":hardcopy".

'buflisted'	Makes a buffer appear in the buffer list or not.

Use "vim{version}:" for modelines, only to be executed when the version is
>= {version}.  Also "vim>{version}", "vim<{version}" and "vim={version}".


Ex commands: ~

:sav[eas][!] {file}
		Works like ":w file" and ":e #", but without loading the file
		again and avoiding other side effects. |:saveas|

:silent[!] {cmd}
		Execute a command silently.  Also don't use a delay that would
		come after the message.  And don't do 'showmatch'.
		RISCOS: Removed that "!~cmd" didn't output anything, and
		didn't wait for <Enter> afterwards.  Can use ":silent !cmd"
		now.
:menu <silent>  Add a menu that won't echo Ex commands.
:map <silent>   Add a mapping that won't echo Ex commands.

:checktime	Check for changed buffers.

:verbose {cmd}  Set 'verbose' for one command.

:echomsg {expr}
:echoerr {expr} Like ":echo" but store the message in the history. (Mark
		Waggoner)

:grepadd	Works just like ":grep" but adds to the current error list
		instead of defining a new list. |:grepadd|

:finish		Finish sourcing a file.  Can be used to skip the rest of a Vim
		script. |:finish|

:leftabove
:aboveleft	Split left/above current window.

:rightbelow
:belowright	Split right/below current window.

:first, :bfirst, :ptfirst, etc.
		Alias for ":rewind".  It's more logical compared to ":last".

:enew		Edit a new, unnamed buffer.  This is needed, because ":edit"
		re-edits the same file. (Wall)

:quitall	Same as ":qall".

:match		Define match highlighting local to a window.  Allows
		highlighting an item in the current window without interfering
		with syntax highlighting.

:menu enable
:menu disable	Commands to enable/disable menu entries without removing them.
		(Monish Shah)

:windo		Execute a command in all windows.
:bufdo		Execute a command in all buffers.

:wincmd		Window (CTRL-W) command.  Useful when a Normal mode command
		can't be used (e.g., for a CursorHold autocommand).  See
		|CursorHold-example| for a nice application with it.

:lcd and :lchdir
		Set local directory for a window. (Benjie Chen)

:hide {command}
		Execute {command} with 'hidden' set.

:emenu		in Visual mode to execute a ":vmenu" entry.

:popup		Pop up a popup menu.

:redraw		Redraw the screen even when busy with a script or function.

:hardcopy	Print to paper.

:compiler	Load a Vim script to do settings for a specific compiler.

:z#		List numbered lines. (Bohdan Vlasyuk)


New marks: ~

'( and ')	Begin or end of current sentence.  Useful in Ex commands.
'{ and '}	Begin or end of current paragraph.  Useful in Ex commands.
'.		Position of the last change in the current buffer.
'^		Position where Insert mode was stopped.

Store the ^ and . marks in the viminfo file.  Makes it possible to jump to the
last insert position or changed text.


New functions: ~
argidx()	Current index in argument list.
buflisted()	Checks if the buffer exists and has 'buflisted' set.
cindent()	Get indent according to 'cindent'.

		for the Help/Find.. and Toolbar FindHelp items.
		(Win32 support by Thore B. Karlsen)
		(Win16 support by Vince Negri)
inputsecret()	Ask the user to type a string without showing the typed keys.
		(Charles Campbell)

Added expansion of curly braces in variable and function names.  This can be
used for variable names that include the value of an option.  Or a primitive
form of arrays. (Vince Negri)


New autocommand events: ~
BufWinEnter	Triggered when a buffer is displayed in a window, after using
		the modelines.  Can be used to load a view.
BufWinLeave	Triggered when a buffer is no longer in a window.  Also
		triggered when exiting Vim.  Can be used to save views.
FileChangedRO	Triggered before making the first change to a read-only file.
		Can be used to check-out the file. (Scott Graham)
TermResponse	Triggered when the terminal replies to the version-request.
		The v:termresponse internal variable holds the result.  Can be
		used to react to the version of the terminal.  (Ronald Schild)
FileReadCmd	Triggered before reading a file.
BufReadCmd	Triggered before reading a file into a buffer.
FileWriteCmd	Triggered before writing a file.
BufWriteCmd	Triggered before writing a buffer into a file.
FileAppendCmd	Triggered before appending to a file.
FuncUndefined	Triggered when a user function is not defined. (Ron Aaron)

The autocommands for the *Cmd events read or write the file instead of normal
file read/write.  Use this in netrw.vim to be able to edit files on a remote
system. (Charles Campbell)

Updated many syntax files to work both with Vim 5.7 and 6.0.

Interface to Ruby. (Shugo Maeda)
Support dynamic loading of the Ruby interface on MS-Windows. (Muraoka Taro)
Support this for Mingw too. (Benoit Cerrina)

Win32: Added possibility to load TCL dynamically. (Muraoka Taro)
Also for Borland 5.5. (Dan Sharp)

Win32: When editing a file that is a shortcut (*.lnk file), edit the file it
links to.  Unless 'binary' is set, then edit the shortcut file itself.
(Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

The ":command" command now accepts a "-bar" argument.  This allows the user
command to be followed by "| command".

The preview window is now also used by these commands:
- |:pedit| edits the specified file in the preview window
- |:psearch| searches for a word in included files, like |:ijump|, and
  displays the found text in the preview window.
Added the CTRL-W P command: go to preview window.

MS-DOS and MS-Windows also read the system-wide vimrc file $VIM/vimrc.  Mostly
for NT systems with multiple users.

A double-click of the mouse on a character that has a "%" match selects from
that character to the match.  Similar to "v%".

"-S session.vim" argument: Source a script file when starting up.  Convenient
way to start Vim with a session file.

Added "--cmd {command}" Vim argument to execute a command before a vimrc file
is loaded. (Vince Negri)

Added the "-M" Vim argument: reset 'modifiable' and 'write', thus disallow
making changes and writing files.

Added runtime/delmenu.vim.  Source this to remove all menus and prepare for
loading new menus.  Useful when changing 'langmenu'.

Perl script to filter Perl error messages to quickfix usable format. (Joerg
Ziefle)

Added runtime/macros/less.vim: Vim script to simulate less, but with syntax
highlighting.

MS-Windows install program: (Jon Merz)
- The Win32 program can now create shortcuts on the desktop and install Vim in
  the Start menu.
- Possibly remove old "Edit with Vim" entries.
- The Vim executable is never moved or $PATH changed.  A small batch file is
  created in a directory in $PATH.  Fewer choices to be made.
- Detect already installed Vim versions and offer to uninstall them first.

Improved the MS-Windows uninstal program.  It now also deletes the entries in
the Start menu, icons from the desktop and the created batch files. (Jon Merz)
Also made it possible to delete only some of these.  Also unregister gvim for
OLE.

Generate a self-installing Vim package for MS-Windows.  This uses NSIS. (Jon
Merz et al.)

Added ":filetype detect".  Try detecting the filetype again.  Helps when
writing a new shell script, after adding "#!/bin/csh".

Added ":augroup! name" to delete an autocommand group.  Needed for the
client-server "--remote-wait".

Add the Vim version number to the viminfo file, useful for debugging.

==============================================================================
IMPROVEMENTS						*improvements-6*

Added the 'n' flag in 'cpoptions': When omitted text of wrapped lines is not
put between line numbers from 'number' option.  Makes it a lot easier to read
wrapped lines.

When there is a format error in a tags file, the byte position is reported so
that the error can be located.

"gf" works in Visual mode: Use the selected text as the file name. (Chase
Tingley)

Allow ambiguous mappings.  Thus "aa" and "aaa" can both be mapped, the longest
matching one is used.  Especially useful for ":lmap" and 'keymap'.

Encryption: Ask the key to be typed twice when crypting the first time.
Otherwise a typo might cause the text to be lost forever. (Chase Tingley)

The window title now has "VIM" on the end.  The file name comes first, useful
in the taskbar.  A "+" is added when the file is modified.  "=" is added for
a read-only file.  "-" is added for a file with 'modifiable' off.

In Visual mode, mention the size of the selected area in the 'showcmd'
position.

Added the "b:changedtick" variable.  Incremented at each change, also for
undo.  Can be used to take action only if the buffer has been changed.

In the replacement string of a ":s" command "\=" can be used to replace with
the result of an expression.  From this expression the submatch() function can
be used to access submatches.

When doing ":qall" and there is a change in a buffer that is being edited in
another window, jump to that window, instead of editing that buffer in the
current window.

Added the "++enc=" and "++ff=" arguments to file read/write commands to force
using the given 'encoding' or 'fileformat'.  And added the "v:cmdarg"
variable, to be used for FileReadCmd autocommands that read/write the file
themselves.

When reading stdin, first read the text in binary mode and then re-read it
with automatic selection of 'fileformat' and 'fileencoding'.  This avoids
problems with not being able to rewind the file (e.g., when a line near the
end of the file ends in LF instead of CR-LF).
When reading text from stdin and the buffer is empty, don't mark it changed.
Allows exiting without trouble.

Added an ID to many error messages.  This will make it easier to find help for
a message.

Insert mode:
- "CTRL-G j" and "CTRL-G k" can be used to insert in another line in the same
  column.  Useful for editing a table.
- Added Thesaurus completion with CTRL-X CTRL-T. (Vince Negri)
- Added the 'thesaurus' option, to use instead of 'dictionary' for thesaurus
  completion.  Added the 's' flag in 'complete'.
- Made CTRL-X CTRL-L in Insert mode use the 'complete' option.  It now also
  scans other loaded buffers for matching lines.
- CTRL-R now also works in Insert mode while doing completion with CTRL-X or
  CTRL-N. (Neil Bird)
- When doing Insert mode completion, when completion is finished check for a
  match with words from 'cinkeys' or 'indentkeys'.

Performance:
- Made display updating more efficient.  Insert/delete lines may be used for
  all changes, also for undo/redo.
- The display is not redrawn when there is typeahead in Insert mode.  Speeds
  up CTRL-R a lot.
- Improved speed of screen output for 32 bit DOS version. (Vince Negri)
- When dragging with the mouse, there is a lookahead to skip mouse codes when
  there is another one next.  Makes dragging with the mouse a lot faster.
- Also a memory usage improvement: When calling u_save with a single line,
  don't save it if the line was recently saved for the same undo already.
- When using a script that appends one character at a time, the amount of
  allocated memory was growing steadily.  Also when 'undolevels' is -1.
  Caused by the line saved for "U" never to be freed.  Now free an undo block
  when it becomes empty.
- GUI and Dos32: Use a vertical scroll region, to make scrolling in a
  vertically split window faster.  No need to redraw the whole window.
- When scrolling isn't possible with terminal codes (e.g., for a vertically
  split window) redraw from ScreenLines[].  That should be faster than going
  through the lines with win_line(), especially when using syntax
  highlighting.
- The Syntax menu is now pre-generated by a separate script.  Makes loading
  the menu 70% faster.  This can halve the startup time of gvim.
- When doing ":help tag", don't open help.txt first, jump directly to the help
  tag.  It's faster and avoids an extra message.
- Win32: When a file name doesn't end in ".lnk" don't try resolving a
  shortcut, it takes quite a bit of time.
- Don't update the mouse pointer shape while there are typeahead characters.
- Change META[] from a string into an array, avoids using strchr() on it.
- Don't clear the command line when adding characters, avoids that screen_fill
  is called but doesn't do anything.

Robustness:
- Unix: Check for running out of stack space when executing a regexp.  Avoids
  a nasty crash.  Only works when the system supports running the signal
  function on another stack.
- Disallow ":source <dirname>".  On unix it's possible to read a directory,
  does not make sense to use it as Vim commands.

Security:
- When reading from or writing to a temporary file, check that it isn't a
  symbolic link.  Gives some protection against symlink attacks.
- When creating a backup file copy or a swap file, check for it already
  existing to avoid a symlink attack. (Colin Phipps)
- Evaluating options which are an expression is done in a |sandbox|.  If the
  option was set by a modeline, it cannot cause damage.
- Use a secure way to generate temp file names: Create a private directory for
  temp files.  Used for Unix, MS-DOS and OS/2.
- 'makeef' can be empty, which means that an internally generated file name is
  used.  The old default was "/tmp/file", which is a security risk.
  Writing 'makeef' in the current directory fails in a read-only directory and
  causes trouble when using ":grep" on all files.  Made the default empty for
  all systems, so that a temp file is used.
- The command from a tags file is executed in the sandbox for better security.
- The Ruby, Tcl and Python interfaces cannot be used from the sandbox.  They
  might do dangerous things.  Perl is still possible, but limited to the Safe
  environment. (Donnie Smith)

Syntax highlighting:
- Optimized the speed by caching the state stack all over the file, not just
  the part being displayed.  Required for folding.
- Added ":syntax sync fromstart": Always parse from the start of the file.
- Added the "display" argument for syntax items: use the item only when
  displaying the result.  Can make parsing faster for text that isn't going to
  be displayed.
- When using CTRL-L, the cached states are deleted, to force parsing the text
  again.
- Use elfhash algorithm for table of keywords.  This should give a better
  distribution and speedup keyword lookup. (Campbell)
- Also allow the "lc" leading context for skip and end patterns. (Scott
  Bigham)
- Syntax items can have the "extend" argument to undo the effect of a
  "keepend" argument of an item it is contained in.  Makes it possible to have
  some contained items extend a region while others don't.
- ":syntax clear" now deletes the b:current_syntax variable.  That's logical,
  since no syntax is defined after this command.
- Added ":syntax enable": switch on syntax highlighting without changing the
  colors.  This allows specifying the colors in the .vimrc file without the
  need for a mysyntaxfile.
- Added ":syntax reset": reset the colors to their defaults.
- Added the "contains=TOP" and "contains=CONTAINED" arguments.  Makes it
  possible to define a transparent item that doesn't contain itself.
- Added a "containedin" argument to syntax items.  Allows adding a contained
  item to an existing item (e.g., to highlight a name in a comment).

Modeless selection:
- When in the command-line window, use modeless selection in the other
  windows.  Makes it possible to copy visible text to the command-line window.
- Support modeless selection on the cmdline in a terminal.  Previously it was
  only possible for the GUI.
- Make double-right-click in modeless selection select a whole word.  Single
  right click doesn't use the word selection started by a double-left-click.
  Makes it work like in Visual mode.
- The modeless selection no longer has an implied automatic copy to the
  clipboard.  It now obeys the 'a' and 'A' flags in 'guioptions' or
  "autoselect" and "autoselectml" in 'clipboard'.
- Added the CTRL-Y command in Cmdline-mode to copy the modeless selection to
  the clipboard.  Also works at the hit-enter prompt and the more prompt.
  Removed the mappings in runtime/mswin.vim for CTRL-Y and CTRL-Z in
  cmdline-mode to be able to use CTRL-Y in the new way.

Reduced the amount of stack space used by regmatch() to allow it to handle
complicated patterns on a longer text.

'isfname' now includes '%' and '#'.  Makes "vim dir\#file" work for MS-DOS.

Added keypad special keys <kEnter>, <k0> - <k9>.  When not mapped they behave
like the ASCII equivalent. (Ivan Wellesz and Vince Negri)
Recognize a few more xterm keys: <C-Right>, <C-Left>, <C-End>, <C-Home>

Also trigger the BufUnload event when Vim is going to exit.  Perhaps a script
needs to do some cleaning up.

Expand expression in backticks: `={expr}`.  Can be used where backtick
expansion is done. (Vince Negri)

GUI:
- Added 'L' and 'R' flags in 'guioptions': Add a left or right scrollbar only
  when there is a vertically split window.
- X11: When a color can't be allocated, use the nearest match from the
  colormap.  This avoids that black is used for many things. (Monish Shah)
  Also do this for the menu and scrollbar, to avoid that they become black.
- Win32 and X11: Added 'mouseshape' option: Adjust the mouse pointer shape to
  the current mode. (Vince Negri)
- Added the 'linespace' option: Insert a pixel line between lines. (Nam)
- Allow modeless selection (without moving the cursor) by keeping CTRL and
  SHIFT pressed. (Ivan Wellesz)
- Motif: added toolbar. (Gordon Prieur)  Also added tooltips.
- Athena: added toolbar and tooltips. (David Harrison -- based on Gordon
  Prieur's work)
- Made the 'toolbar' option work for Athena and Motif.  Can now switch between
  text and icons on the fly.  (David Harrison)
- Support menu separator lines for Athena.  (David Harrison)
- Athena: Adjust the arrow pixmap used in a pullright menu to the size of the
  font. (David Harrison)
- Win32: Added "c" flag to 'guifont' to be able to specify the charset. (Artem
  Khodush)
- When no --enable-xim argument is given, automatically enable it when a X GUI
  is used.  Required for dead key support (and multi-byte input).
- After a file selection dialog, check that the edited files were not changed
  or deleted.  The Win32 dialog allows deleting and renaming files.
- Motif and Athena: Added support for "editres". (Marcin Dalecki)
- Motif and Athena: Added "menuFont" to be able to specify a font or fontset
  for the menus.  Can also be set with the "Menu" highlight group.  Useful
  when the locale is different from 'encoding'. (David Harrison)
  When FONTSET_ALWAYS is defined, always use a fontset for the menus.  Should
  avoid trouble with changing from a font to a fontset.  (David Harrison)
- Highlighting and font for the tooltips can be specified with the "Tooltip"
  highlight group. (David Harrison)
- The Cmdline-mode menus can be used at the more-prompt.  This mostly works
  fine, because they start with a CTRL-C.  The "Copy" menu works to copy the
  modeless selection.  Allows copying the output of ":set all" or ":intro"
  without auto-selection.
- When starting the GUI when there is no terminal connected to stdout and
  stderr, display error messages in a dialog.  Previously they wouldn't be
  displayed at all.
- Allow setting 'browsedir' to the name of a directory, to be used for the
  file dialog. (Dan Sharp)
- b:browsefilter and g:browsefilter can be set to the filters used for the
  file dialog.  Supported for Win32 and Motif GUI. (Dan Sharp)

X11:
- Support for the clipboard selection as register "+.  When exiting or
  suspending copy the selection to cut buffer 0.  Should allow copy/paste with
  more applications in a X11-standard way.  (Neil Bird)
- Use the X clipboard in any terminal, not just in an xterm.
  Added "exclude:" in 'clipboard': Specify a pattern to match against terminal
  names for which no connection should be made to the X server.  The default
  currently work for FreeBSD and Linux consoles.
- Added a few messages for when 'verbose' is non-zero to show what happens
  when trying to connect to the X server.  Should help when trying to find out
  why startup is slow.

GTK GUI: (partly by Marcin Dalecki)
- With some fonts the characters can be taller than ascent + descent.  E.g.,
  "-misc-fixed-*-*-*-*-18-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1".  Add one to the character
  cell height.
- Implement "no" value for 'winaltkeys': don't use Alt-Key as a menu shortcut,
  when 'wak' changed after creating the menus.
- Setting 'wak' after the GUI started works.
- recycle text GC's to reduce communication.
- Adjust icon size to window manager.
- Cleanup in font handling.
- Replace XQueryColor with GDK calls.
- Gnome support.  Detects Gnome in configure and uses different widgets.
  Otherwise it's much like GTK. (Andy Kahn)
  It is disabled by default, because it causes a few problems.
- Removed the special code to fork first and then start the GUI.  Now use
  _exit() instead of exit(), this works fine without special tricks.
- Dialogs sometimes appeared a bit far away.  Position the dialogs inside
  the gvim window. (Brent Verner)
- When dropping a file on Vim, remove extra slashes from the start of the
  path.  Also shorten the file name if possible.

Motif: (Marcin Dalecki)
- Made the dialog layout better.
- Added find and find/replace dialogs.
- For the menus, change "iso-8859" to "iso_8859", Linux appears to need this.
- Added icon to dialogs, like for GTK.
- Use XPM bitmaps for the icon when possible.  Use the Solaris XpmP.h include
  file when it's available.
- Change the shadow of the toolbar items to get a visual feedback of it being
  pressed on non-LessTif.
- Use gadgets instead of windows for some items for speed.

Command line completion:
- Complete environment variable names. (Mike Steed)
- For ":command", added a few completion methods: "mapping", "function",
  "expression" and "environment".
- When a function doesn't take arguments, let completion add () instead of (.

For MS-DOS, MS-Windows and OS/2: Expand %VAR% environment variables like $VAR.
(Walter Briscoe)

Redirect messages to the clipboard ":redir @*" and to the unnamed register
":redir @"". (Wall)

":let @/ = ''" clears the search pattern, instead of setting it to an empty
string.

Expression evaluation:
- "? :" can be used like in C.
- col("$") returns the length of the cursor line plus one. (Stephen P. Wall)
- Optional extra argument for match(), matchend() and matchstr(): Offset to
  start looking for a match.
- Made third argument to strpart() optional.  (Paul Moore, Zdenek Sekera)
- exists() can also be used to check for Ex commands and defined autocommands.
- Added extra argument to input(): Default text.
- Also set "v:errmsg" when using ":silent! cmd".
- Added the v:prevcount variable: v:count for the previous command.
- Added "v:progname", name with which Vim was started. (Vince Negri)
- In the verbose message about returning from a function, also show the return
  value.

Cscope:
- Added the cscope_connection() function. (Andy Kahn)
- ":cscope kill -1" kills all cscope connections. (Andy Kahn)
- Added the 'cscopepathcomp' option. (Scott Hauck)
- Added ":scscope" command, split window and execute Cscope command. (Jason
  Duell)

VMS:
- Command line arguments are always uppercase.  Interpret a "-X" argument as
  "-x" and "-/X" as "-X".
- Set 'makeprg' and 'grepprg' to meaningful defaults. (Zoltan Arpadffy)
- Use the X-clipboard feature and the X command server. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

Macintosh: (Dany St-Amant)
- Allow a tags file to have CR, CR-LF or LF line separator. (Axel Kielhorn)
- Carbonized (while keeping non Carbon code)
  (Some work "stolen" from Ammon Skidmore)
- Improved the menu item index handling (should be faster)
- Runtime commands now handle / in file name (MacOS 9 version)
- Added ":winpos" support.
- Support using "~" in file names for home directory.

Options:
- When using set += or ^= , check for items used twice.  Duplicates are
  removed.  (Vince Negri)
- When setting an option that is a list of flags, remove duplicate flags.
- If possible, use getrlimit() to set 'maxmemtot' and 'maxmem'. (Pina)
- Added "alpha" to 'nrformats': increment or decrement an alphabetic character
  with CTRL-A and CTRL-X.
- ":set opt&vi" sets an option to its Vi default, ":set opt&vim" to its Vim
  default.  Useful to set 'cpo' to its Vim default without knowing what flags
  that includes.
- 'scrolloff' now also applies to a long, wrapped line that doesn't fit in the
  window.
- Added more option settings to the default menus.
- Updated the option window with new options.  Made it a bit easier to read.

Internal changes:
- Split line pointers in text part and attributes part.  Allows for future
  change to make attribute more than one byte.
- Provide a qsort() function for systems that don't have it.
- Changed the big switch for Normal mode commands into a table.  This cleans
  up the code considerably and avoids trouble for some optimizing compilers.
- Assigned a negative value to special keys, to avoid them being mixed up with
  Unicode characters.
- Global variables expand_context and expand_pattern were not supposed to be
  global.  Pass them to ExpandOne() and all functions called by it.
- No longer use the global reg_ic flag.  It caused trouble and in a few places
  it was not set.
- Removed the use of the stuff buffer for "*", "K", CTRL-], etc.  Avoids
  problem with autocommands.
- Moved some code from ex_docmd.c to ex_cmds2.c.  The file was getting too
  big.  Also moved some code from screen.c to move.c.
- Don't include the CRC table for encryption, generate it.  Saves quite a bit
  of space in the source code. (Matthias Kramm)
- Renamed multibyte.c to mbyte.c to avoid a problem with 8.3 filesystems.
- Removed the GTK implementation of ":findhelp", it now uses the
  ToolBar.FindHelp  menu entry.
- Renamed mch_windexit() to mch_exit(), mch_init() to mch_early_init() and
  mch_shellinit() to mch_init().

Highlighting:
- In a ":highlight" listing, show "xxx" with the highlight color.
- Added support for xterm with 88 or 256 colors.  The right color numbers will
  be used for the name used in a ":highlight" command. (Steve Wall)
- Added "default" argument for ":highlight".  When included, the command is
  ignored if highlighting for the group was already defined.
  All syntax files now use ":hi default ..." to allow the user to specify
  colors in his vimrc file.  Also, the "if did_xxx_syntax_inits" is not needed
  anymore.  This greatly simplifies using non-default colors for a specific
  language.
- Adjusted colortest.vim: Included colors on normal background and reduced the
  size by using a while loop. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)
- Added the "DarkYellow" color name.  Just to make the list of standard colors
  consistent, it's not really a nice color to use.

When an xterm is in 8-bit mode this is detected by the code returned for
|t_RV|.  All key codes are automatically converted to their 8-bit versions.

The OPT_TCAP_QUERY in xterm patch level 141 and later is used to obtain the
actual key codes used and the number of colors for t_Co.  Only when |t_RV| is
also used.

":browse set" now also works in the console mode.  ":browse edit" will give an
error message.

":bdelete" and ":bunload" only report the number of deleted/unloaded buffers
when more than 'report'.  The message was annoying when deleting a buffer in a
script.

Jump list:
- The number of marks kept in the jumplist has been increased from 50 to 100.
- The jumplist is now stored in the viminfo file.  CTRL-O can be used to jump
  to positions from a previous edit session.
- When doing ":split" copy the jumplist to the new window.

Also set the '[ and '] marks for the "~" and "r" commands.  These marks are
now always set when making a change with a Normal mode command.

Python interface: Allow setting the width of a vertically split window. (John
Cook)

Added "=word" and "=~word" to 'cinkeys' (also used in 'indentkeys').

Added "j1" argument in 'cinoptions': indent {} inside () for Java. (Johannes
Zellner)
Added the "l" flag in 'cinoptions'. (Anduin Withers)
Added 'C', 'U', 'w' and 'm' flags to 'cinoptions'. (Servatius Brandt)

When doing ":wall" or ":wqall" and a modified buffer doesn't have a name,
mention its buffer number in the error message.

":function Name" lists the function with line numbers.  Makes it easier to
find out where an error happened.

In non-blockwise Visual mode, "r" replaces all selected characters with the
typed one, like in blockwise Visual mode.

When editing the last file in the argument list in any way, allow exiting.
Previously this was only possible when getting to that file with ":next" or
":last".

Added the '1' flag to 'formatoptions'. (Vit Stradal)
Added 'n' flag in 'formatoptions': format a numbered list.

Swap file:
- When a swap file already exists, and the user selects "Delete" at the
  ATTENTION prompt, use the same ".swp" swapfile, to avoid creating a ".swo"
  file which won't always be found.
- When giving the ATTENTION message and the date of the file is newer than the
  date of swap file, give a warning about this.
- Made the info for an existing swap file a bit shorter, so that it still fits
  on a 24 line screen.
- It was possible to make a symlink with the name of a swap file, linking to a
  file that doesn't exist.  Vim would then silently use another file (if open
  with O_EXCL refuses a symlink).  Now check for a symlink to exist.  Also do
  another check for an existing swap file just before creating it to catch a
  symlink attack.

The g CTRL-G command also works in Visual mode and counts the number of words.
(Chase Tingley)

Give an error message when using 'shell' and it's empty.

Added the possibility to include "%s" in 'shellpipe'.

Added "uhex" value for 'display': show non-printable characters as <xx>.
Show unprintable characters with NonText highlighting, also in the command
line.

When asked to display the value of a hidden option, tell it's not supported.

Win32:
- When dropping a shortcut on gvim (.lnk file) edit the target, not the
  shortcut itself.  (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
- Added C versions of the OpenWithVim and SendToVim programs. (Walter Briscoe)
- When 'shell' is "cmd" or "cmd.exe", set 'shellredir' to redirect stderr too.
  Also check for the Unix shell names.
- When $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH are defined, use them to define $HOME.  (Craig
  Barkhouse)

Win32 console version:
- Includes the user and system name in the ":version" message, when available.
  It generates a pathdef.c file for this.  (Jon Miner)
- Set the window icon to Vim's icon (only for Windows 2000).  While executing
  a shell command, modify the window title to show this.  When exiting,
  restore the cursor position too.  (Craig Barkhouse)
- The Win32 console version can be compiled with OLE support.  It can only
  function as a client, not as an OLE server.

Errorformat:
- Let "%p" in 'errorformat' (column of error indicated by a row of characters)
  also accept a line of dots.
- Added "%v" item in 'errorformat': Virtual column number. (Dan Sharp)
- Added a default 'errorformat' value for VMS. (Jim Bush)

The "p" command can now be used in Visual mode.  It overwrites the selected
text with the contents of a register.

Highlight the <> items in the intro message to make clear they are special.

When using the "c" flag for ":substitute", allow typing "l" for replacing this
item and then stop: "last".

When printing a verbose message about sourcing another file, print the line
number.

When resizing the Vim window, don't use 'equalalways'.  Avoids that making the
Vim window smaller makes split windows bigger.  And it's what the docs say.

When typing CTRL-D in Insert mode, just after an autoindent, then hitting CR
kept the remaining white space.  Now made it work like BS: delete the
autoindent to avoid a blank non-empty line results.

Added a GetHwnd() call to the OLE interface.  (Vince Negri)

Made ":normal" work in an event handler.  Useful when dropping a file on Vim
and for CursorHold autocommands.

For the MS-Windows version, don't change to the directory of the file when a
slash is used instead of a backslash.  Explorer should always use a backslash,
the user can use a slash when typing the command.

Timestamps:
- When a buffer was changed outside of Vim and regaining focus, give a dialog
  to allow the user to reload the file.  Now also for other GUIs than
  MS-Windows.  And also used in the console, when compiled with dialog
  support.
- Inspect the file contents to find out if it really changed, ignore
  situations where only the time stamp changed (e.g., checking the file out
  from CVS).
- When checking the timestamp, first check if the file size changed, to avoid
  a file compare then.  Makes it quicker for large (log) files that are
  appended to.
- Don't give a warning for a changed or deleted file when 'buftype' is set.
- No longer warn for a changed directory.  This avoids that the file explorer
  produces warnings.
- Checking timestamps is only done for buffers that are not hidden.  These
  will be checked when they become unhidden.
- When checking for a file being changed outside of Vim, also check if the
  file permissions changed.  When the file contents didn't change but the
  permissions did, give a warning.
- Avoid checking too often, otherwise the dialog keeps popping up for a log
  file that steadily grows.

Mapping <M-A> when 'encoding' is "latin1" and then setting 'encoding' to
"utf-8" causes the first byte of a multi-byte to be mapped.  Can cause very
hard to find problems.  Disallow mapping part of a multi-byte character.

For ":python" and ":tcl" accept an in-line script. (Johannes Zellner)
Also for ":ruby" and ":perl". (Benoit Cerrina)

Made ":syn include" use 'runtimepath' when the file name is not a full path.

When 'switchbuf' contains "split" and the current window is empty, don't split
the window.

Unix: Catch SIGPWR to preserve files when the power is about to go down.

Sniff interface: (Anton Leherbauer)
- fixed windows code, esp. the event handling stuff
- adaptations for sniff 4.x ($SNIFF_DIR4)
- support for adding sniff requests at runtime

Support the notation <A-x> as an alias for <M-x>.  This logical, since the Alt
key is used.

":find" accepts a count, which means that the count'th match in 'path' is
used.

":ls" and ":buffers" output shows modified/readonly/modifiable flag.  When a
buffer is active show "a" instead of nothing.  When a buffer isn't loaded
show nothing instead of "-".

Unix install:
- When installing the tools, set absolute paths in tools scripts efm_perl.pl
  and mve.awk.  Avoids that the user has to edit these files.
- Install Icons for KDE when the directories exist and the icons do not exist
  yet.

Added has("win95"), to be able to distinguish between MS-Windows 95/98/ME and
NT/2000/XP in a Vim script.

When a ":cd" command was typed, echo the new current directory. (Dan Sharp)

When using ":winpos" before the GUI window has been opened, remember the
values until it is opened.

In the ":version" output, add "/dyn" for features that are dynamically loaded.
This indicates the feature may not always work.

On Windows NT it is possible that a directory is read-only, but a file can be
deleted.  When making a backup by renaming the file and 'backupdir' doesn't
use the current directory, this causes the original file to be deleted,
without the possibility to create a new file.  Give an extra error message
then to warn to user about this.

Made CTRL-R CTRL-O at the command line work like CTRL-R CTRL-R, so that it's
consistent with Insert mode.

==============================================================================
COMPILE TIME CHANGES					*compile-changes-6*

All generated files have been moved out of the "src" directory.  This makes it
easy to see which files are not edited by hand.  The files generated by
configure are now in the "src/auto" directory.  For Unix, compiled object
files go in the objects directory.

The source archive was over the 1.4M floppy limit.  The archives are now split
up into two runtime and two source archives.  Also provide a bzip2 compressed
archive that contains all the sources and runtime files.

Added "reconfig" as a target for make.  Useful when changing some of the
arguments that require flushing the cache, such as switching from GTK to
Motif.  Adjusted the meaning of GUI_INC_LOC and GUI_LIB_LOC to be consistent
over different GUIs.

Added src/README.txt to give an overview of the main parts of the source code.

The Unix Makefile now fully supports using $(DESTDIR) to install to a specific
location.  Replaces the manual setting of *ENDLOC variables.

Added the possibility for a maintainer of a binary version to include his
e-mail address with the --with-compiledby configure argument.

Included features are now grouped in "tiny", "small", "normal", "big" and
"huge".  This replaces "min-features" and "max-features".  Using "tiny"
disables multiple windows for a really small Vim.

For the tiny version or when FEAT_WINDOWS is not defined: Firstwin and lastwin
are equal to curwin and don't use w_next and w_prev.

Added the +listcmds feature.  Can be used to compile without the Vim commands
that manipulate the buffer list and argument list (the buffer list itself is
still there, can't do without it).

Added the +vreplace feature.  It is disabled in the "small" version to avoid
that the 16 bit DOS version runs out of memory.

Removed GTK+ support for versions older than 1.1.16.

The configure checks for using PTYs have been improved.  Code taken from a
recent version of screen.

Added configure options to install Vim, Ex and View under another name (e.g.,
vim6, ex6 and view6).

Added "--with-global-runtime" configure argument.  Allows specifying the
global directory used in the 'runtimepath' default.

Made enabling the SNiFF+ interface possible with a configure argument.

Configure now always checks /usr/local/lib for libraries and
/usr/local/include for include files.  Helps finding the stuff for iconv() and
gettext().

Moved the command line history stuff into the +cmdline_hist feature, to
exclude the command line history from the tiny version.

MS-Windows: Moved common functions from Win16 and Win32 to os_mswin.c.  Avoids
having to change two files for one problem.  (Vince Negri)

Moved common code from gui_w16.c and gui_w32.c to gui_w48.c (Vince Negri)

The jumplist is now a separate feature.  It is disabled for the "small"
version (16 bit MS-DOS).

Renamed all types ending in _t to end in _T.  Avoids potential problems with
system types.

Added a configure check for X11 header files that implicitly define the return
type to int. (Steve Wall)

"make doslang" in the top directory makes an archive with the menu and .mo
files for Windows.  This uses the files generated on Unix, these should work
on MS-Windows as well.

Merged a large part of os_vms.c with os_unix.c.  The code was duplicated in
the past which made maintenance more work.  (Zoltan Arpadffy)

Updated the Borland C version 5 Makefile: (Dan Sharp)
- Fixed the Perl build
- Added python and tcl builds
- Added dynamic perl and dynamic python builds
- Added uninstal.exe build
- Use "yes" and "no" for the options, like in Make_mvc.mak.

Win32: Merged Make_gvc.mak and Make_ovc.mak into one file: Make_ivc.mak.  It's
much smaller, many unnecessary text has been removed. (Walter Briscoe)
Added Make_dvc.mak to be able to debug exe generated with Make_mvc.mak in
MS-Devstudio. (Walter Briscoe)

MS-Windows: The big gvim.exe, which includes OLE, now also includes
dynamically loaded Tcl, Perl and Python.  This uses ActivePerl 5.6.1,
ActivePython 2.1.1 and ActiveTCL 8.3.3

Added AC_EXEEXT to configure.in, to check if the executable needs ".exe" for
Cygwin or MingW.  Renamed SUFFIX to EXEEXT in Makefile.

Win32: Load comdlg32.dll delayed for faster startup.  Only when using VC 6.
(Vipin Aravind)

Win32: When compiling with Borland, allow using IME. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Win32: Added Makefile for Borland 5 to compile gvimext.dll. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

==============================================================================
BUG FIXES						*bug-fixes-6*

When checking the command name for "gvim", "ex", etc. ignore case.  Required
for systems where case is ignored in command names.

Search pattern "[a-c-e]" also matched a 'd' and didn't match a '-'.

When double-clicking in another window, wasn't recognized as double click,
because topline is different.  Added set_mouse_topline().

The BROKEN_LOCALE check was broken.  (Marcin Dalecki)

When "t_Co" is set, the default colors remain the same, thus wrong.  Reset the
colors after changing "t_Co". (Steve Wall)

When exiting with ":wqall" the messages about writing files could overwrite
each other and be lost forever.

When starting Vim with an extremely long file name (around 1024 characters) it
would crash.  Added a few checks to avoid buffer overflows.

CTRL-E could get stuck in a file with very long lines.

":au syntax<Tab>" expanded event names while it should expand groups starting
with "syntax".

When expanding a file name caused an error (e.g., for <amatch>) it was
produced even when inside an "if 0".

'cindent' formatted C comments differently from what the 'comments' option
specified. (Steve Wall)

Default for 'grepprg' didn't include the file name when only grepping in one
file.  Now /dev/null has been added for Unix.

Opening the option window twice caused trouble.  Now the cursor goes to the
existing option window.

":sview" and ":view" didn't set 'readonly' for an existing buffer.  Now do set
'readonly', unless the buffer is also edited in another window.

GTK GUI: When 'guioptions' excluded 'g', the more prompt caused the toolbar
and menubar to disappear and resize the window (which clears the text).
Now always grey-out the toplevel menus to avoid that the menubar changes size
or disappears.

When re-using the current buffer for a new buffer, buffer-local variables were
not deleted.

GUI: when 'scrolloff' is 0 dragging the mouse above the window didn't cause a
down scroll.  Now pass on a mouse event with mouse_row set to -1.

Win32: Console version didn't work on telnet, because of switching between two
console screens.  Now use one console screen and save/restore the contents
when needed.  (Craig Barkhouse)

When reading a file the magic number for encryption was included in the file
length. (Antonio Colombo)

The quickfix window contained leading whitespace and NULs for multi-line
messages. (David Harrison)

When using cscope, redundant tags were removed.  This caused a numbering
problem, because they were all listed.  Don't remove redundant cscope tags.
(David Bustos).

Cscope: Test for which matches are in the current buffer sometimes failed,
causing a jump to another match than selected. (David Bustos)

Win32: Buffer overflow when adding a charset name in a font.

'titlestring' and 'iconstring' were evaluating an expression in the current
context, which could be a user function, which is a problem for local
variables vs global variables.

Win32 GUI: Mapping <M-F> didn't work.  Now handle SHIFT and CTRL in
_OnSysChar().

Win32 GUI: (on no file), :vs<CR>:q<CR> left a trail of pixels down the middle.
Could also happen for the ruler.  screen_puts() didn't clear the right char in
ScreenLines[] for the bold trick.

Win32: ":%!sort|uniq" didn't work, because the input file name touches the
"|".  Insert a space before the "|".

OS/2: Expanding wildcards included non-existing files.  Caused ":runtime" to
fail, which caused syntax highlighting to fail.

Pasting a register containing CTRL-R on the command line could cause an
endless loop that can't be interrupted.  Now it can be stopped with CTRL-C.

When 'verbose' is set, a message for file read/write could overwrite the
previous message.
When 'verbose' is set, the header from ":select" was put after the last
message.  Now start a new line.

The hit-enter prompt reacted to the response of the t_RV string, causing
messages at startup to disappear.

When t_Co was set to 1, colors were still used.  Now only use color when t_Co
> 1.

Listing functions with ":function" didn't quit when 'q' or ':' was typed at
the more prompt.

Use mkstemp() instead of mktemp() when it's available, avoids a warning for
linking on FreeBSD.

When doing Insert mode completion it's possible that b_sfname is NULL.  Don't
give it to printf() for the "Scanning" message.

":set runtimepath-=$VIMRUNTIME" didn't work, because expansion of wildcards
was done after trying to remove the string.  Now for ":set opt+=val" and ":set
opt-=val" the expansion of wildcards is done before adding or removing "val".

Using CTRL-V with the "r" command with a blockwise Visual selection inserted a
CTRL-V instead of getting a special character.

Unix: Changed the order of libraries: Put -lXdmcp after -lX11 and -lSM -lICE
after -lXdmcp.  Should fix link problem on HP-UX 10.20.

Don't remove the last "-lm" from the link line.  Vim may link but fail later
when the GUI starts.

When the shell returns with an error when trying to expand wildcards, do
include the pattern when the "EW_NOTFOUND" flag was set.
When expanding wildcards with the shell fails, give a clear error message
instead of just "1 returned".

Selecting a Visual block, with the start partly on a Tab, deleting it leaves
the cursor too far to the left.  Causes "s" to work in the wrong position.

Pound sign in normal.c caused trouble on some compilers.  Use 0xA3 instead.

Warning for changing a read-only file wasn't given when 'insertmode' was set.

Win32: When 'shellxquote' is set to a double quote (e.g., using csh), ":!start
notepad file" doesn't work.  Remove the double quotes added by 'shellxquote'
when using ":!start". (Pavol Juhas)

The "<f-args>" argument of ":command" didn't accept Tabs for white space.
Also, don't add an empty argument when there are trailing blanks.

":e test\\je" edited "test\je", but ":next test\\je" edited "testje".
Backslashes were removed one time too many for ":next".

VMS: "gf" didn't work properly.  Use vms_fixfilename() to translate the file
name. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

After ":hi Normal ctermbg=black ctermfg=white" and suspending Vim not all
characters are redrawn with the right background.

When doing "make test" without +eval or +windows feature, many tests failed.
Now have test1 generate a script to copy the correct output, so that a test
that doesn't work is skipped.

On FreeBSD the Perl interface added "-lc" to the link command and Python added
"-pthread".  These two don't work together, because the libc_r library should
be used.  Removed "-lc" from Perl, it should not be needed.
Also: Add "-pthread" to $LIBS, so that the checks for functions is done with
libc_r.  Sigaltstack() appears to be missing from libc_r.

The Syntax sub-menus were getting too long, reorganized them and added another
level for some languages.

Visual block "r"eplace didn't work well when a Tab is partly included.
(Matthias Kramm)

When yanking a Visual block, where some lines end halfway the block, putting
the text somewhere else doesn't insert a block.  Padd with spaces for missing
characters.  Added "y_width" to struct yankreg. (Matthias Kramm)

If a substitute string has a multibyte character after a backslash only the
first byte of it was skipped. (Muraoka Taro)

Win32: Numeric keypad keys were missing from the builtin termcap entry.

When a file was read-only ":wa!" didn't force it to be written. (Vince Negri)

Amiga: A file name starting with a colon was considered absolute but it isn't.
Amiga: ":pwd" added a slash when in the root of a drive.

Don't let 'ttymouse' default to "dec" when compiled with dec mouse support.
It breaks the gpm mouse (Linux console).

The prototypes for the Perl interface didn't work for threaded Perl.  Added a
sed command to remove the prototypes from proto/if_perl.pro and added them
manually to if_perl.xs.

When ":w!" resets the 'readonly' option the title and status lines were not
updated.

":args" showed the current file when the argument list was empty.  Made this
work like Vi: display nothing.

"99:<C-U>echo v:count" echoed "99" in Normal mode, but 0 in Visual mode.
Don't set v:count when executing a stuffed command.

Amiga: Got a requester for "home:" because it's in the default runtime path.
Don't bring up a requester when searching for a file in 'path', sourcing the
.vimrc file or using ":runtime".

Win16 and Win32: Considered a file "\path\file" absolute.  Can cause the same
file to appear as two different buffers.

Win32: Renaming a file to an empty string crashed Vim.  Happened when using
explorer.vim and hitting ESC at the rename prompt.

Win32: strftime() crashed when called with a "-1" value for the time.

Win32 with Borland compiler: mch_FullName() didn't work, caused tag file not
to be found.

Cscope sometimes jumped to the wrong tag. (David Bustos)

OS/2: Could not find the tags file.  mch_expand_wildcards() added another
slash to a directory name.

When using ">>" the `] mark was not in the last column.

When Vim was compiled without menu support, filetype.vim was still trying to
source the menu.vim script. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)

":ptag" added an item to the tag stack.

Win32 IME: "gr" didn't use IME mode.

In the "vim --help" message the term "options" was used for arguments.  That's
confusing, call them "arguments".

When there are two windows, and a BufUnload autocommand for closing window #1
closed window #2, Vim would crash.

When there is a preview window and only one other window, ":q" wouldn't exit.

In Insert mode, when cancelling a digraph with ESC, the '?' wasn't removed.

On Unix glob(".*") returned "." and "..", on Windows it didn't.  On Windows
glob("*") also returned files starting with a dot.  Made this work like Unix
on all systems.

Win32: Removed old code to open a console.  Vimrun is now used and works fine.

Compute the room needed by the intro message accurately, so that it also fits
on a 25 line console. (Craig Barkhouse)

":ptnext" was broken.  Now remember the last tag used in the preview window
separately from the tagstack.

Didn't check for "-display" being the last argument. (Wichert Akkerman)

GTK GUI: When starting "gvim" under some conditions there would be an X error.
Don't replace the error handler when creating the xterm clipboard. (Wichert
Akkerman)

Adding a space after a help tag caused the tag not to be found.  E.g., ":he
autoindent ".

Was trying to expand a URL into a full path name.  On Windows this resulted in
the current directory to be prepended to the URL.  Added vim_isAbsName() and
vim_FullName() to avoid that various machine specific functions do it
differently.

":n *.c" ":cd .." ":n" didn't use the original directory of the file.  Vi only
does it for the current file (looks like a bug).  Now remember the buffer used
for the entry in the argument list and use its name (adjusted when doing
":cd"), unless it's deleted.

When inserting a special key as its name ("<F8>" as four characters) after
moving around in Insert mode, undo didn't work properly.

Motif GUI: When using the right mouse button, for some people gvim froze for
a couple of seconds (Motif 1.2?).  This doesn't happen when there is no Popup
menu.  Solved by only creating a popup menu when 'mousemodel' is "popup" or
"popup_setpos". (David Harrison)

Motif: When adding many menu items, the "Help" menu disappeared but the
menubar didn't wrap.  Now manually set the menubar height.

When using <BS> in Insert mode to remove a line break, or using "J" to join
lines, the cursor could end up halfway a multi-byte character. (Muraoka Taro)

Removed defining SVR4 in configure.  It causes problems for some X header
files and doesn't appear to be used anywhere.

When 'wildignore' is used, 'ignorecase' for a tag match was not working.

When 'wildignore' contains "*~" it was impossible to edit a file ending in a
"~".  Now don't recognize a file ending in "~" as containing wildcards.

Disabled the mouse code for OS/2.  It was not really used.

":mksession" always used the full path name for a buffer, also when the short
name could be used.
":mkvimrc" and ":mksession" didn't save 'wildchar' and 'pastetoggle' in such a
way that they would be restored.  Now use the key name if possible, this is
portable.

After recovering a file and abandoning it, an ":edit" command didn't give the
ATTENTION prompt again.  Would be useful to be able to delete the file in an
easy way.  Reset the BF_RECOVERED flag when unloading the buffer.

histdel() could match or ignore case, depending on what happened before it.
Now always match case.

When a window size was specified when splitting a window, it would still get
the size from 'winheight' or 'winwidth' if it's larger.

When using "append" or "insert" inside a function definition, a line starting
with "function" or "endfunction" caused confusion.  Now recognize the commands
and skip lines until a ".".

At the end of any function or sourced file need_wait_return could be reset,
causing messages to disappear when redrawing.

When in a while loop the line number for error messages stayed fixed.  Now the
line number is remembered in the while loop.

"cd c:/" didn't work on MS-DOS.  mch_isdir() removed a trailing slash.

MS-Windows: getftime() didn't work when a directory had a trailing slash or
backslash.  Didn't show the time in the explorer because of this.

When doing wildcard completion, a directory "a/" sorted after "a-b".  Now
recognize path separators when sorting files.

Non-Unix systems: When editing "c:/dir/../file" and "c:/file" they were
created as different buffers, although it's the same file.  Expand to a full
file name also when an absolute name contains "..".

"g&" didn't repeat the last substitute properly.

When 'clipboard' was set to "unnamed", a "Y" command would not write to "0.
Now make a copy of register 0 to the clipboard register.

When the search pattern matches in many ways, it could not always be
interrupted with a CTRL-C.  And CTRL-C would have to be hit once for every
line when 'hlsearch' is on.
When 'incsearch' is on and interrupting the search for a match, don't abandon
the command line.

When turning a directory name into a full path, e.g., with fnamemodify(),
sometimes a slash was added.  Make this consistent: Don't add a slash.

When a file name contains a "!", using it in a shell command will cause
trouble: ":!cat %".  Escape the "!" to avoid that.  Escape it another time
when 'shell' contains "sh".

Completing a file name that has a tail that starts with a "~" didn't work:
":e view/~<Tab>".

Using a ":command" argument that contains < and > but not for a special
argument was not skipped properly.

The DOS install program: On Win2000 the check for a vim.exe or gvim.exe in
$PATH didn't work, it always found it in the current directory.
Rename the vim.exe in the current dir to avoid this. (Walter Briscoe)

In the MS-DOS/Windows install program, use %VIM% instead of an absolute path,
so that moving Vim requires only one change in the batch file.

Mac: mch_FullName() changed the "fname" argument and didn't always initialize
the buffer.

MS-DOS: mch_FullName() didn't fix forward/backward slashes in an absolute file
name.

"echo expand("%:p:h")" with an empty file name removed one directory name on
MS-DOS.  For Unix, when the file name is a directory, the directory name was
removed.  Now make it consistent: "%:p" adds a path separator for all systems,
but no path separator is added in other situations.

Unix: When checking for a CTRL-C (could happen any time) and there is an X
event (e.g., clipboard updated) and there is typeahead, Vim would hang until a
character was typed.

MS-DOS, MS-Windows and Amiga: expanding "$ENV/foo" when $ENV ends in a colon,
had the slash removed.

":he \^=" gave an error for using \_.  ":he ^=" didn't find tag :set^=.  Even
"he :set^=" didn't find it.

A tags file name "D:/tags" was used as file "tags" in "D:".  That doesn't work
when the current path for D: isn't the root of the drive.

Removed calls to XtInitializeWidgetClass(), they shouldn't be necessary.

When using a dtterm or various other color terminals, and the Normal group has
been set to use a different background color, the background wouldn't always
be displayed with that color.  Added check for "ut" termcap entry: If it's
missing, clearing the screen won't give us the current background color.  Need
to draw each character instead.  Vim now also works when the "cl" (clear
screen) termcap entry is missing.

When repeating a "/" search command with a line offset, the "n" did use the
offset but didn't make the motion linewise.  Made "d/pat/+2" and "dn" do the
same.

Win32: Trying to use ":tearoff" for a menu that doesn't exist caused a crash.

OpenPTY() didn't work on Sequent.  Add a configure check for getpseudotty().

C-indenting: Indented a line starting with ")" with the matching "(", but not
a line starting with "x)" looks strange.  Also compute the indent for aligning
with items inside the () and use the lowest indent.

MS-DOS and Windows: ":n *.vim" also matched files ending in "~".
Moved mch_expandpath() from os_win16.c and os_msdos.c to misc1.c, they are
equal.

Macintosh: (Dany St-Amant)
- In Vi-compatible mode didn't read files with CR line separators.
- Fixed a bug in the handling of Activate/Deactivate Event
- Fixed a bug in gui_mch_dialog (using wrong pointer)

Multibyte GDK XIM: While composing a multibyte-word, if user presses a
mouse button, then the word is removed.  It should remain and composing end.
(Sung-Hyun Nam)

MS-DOS, MS-Windows and OS/2: When reading from stdin, automatic CR-LF
conversion by the C library got in the way of detecting a "dos" 'fileformat'.

When 'smartcase' is set, patterns with "\S" would also make 'ignorecase'
reset.

When clicking the mouse in a column larger than 222, it moved to the first
column.  Can't encode a larger number in a character.  Now limit the number to
222, don't jump back to the first column.

GUI: In some versions CSI would cause trouble, either when typed directly or
when part of a multi-byte sequence.

When using multibyte characters in a ":normal" command, a trailing byte that
is CSI or K_SPECIAL caused problems.

Wildmenu didn't handle multi-byte characters.

":sleep 10" could not be interrupted on Windows, while "gs" could.  Made them
both work the same.

Unix: When waiting for a character is interrupted by an X-windows event (e.g.,
to obtain the contents of the selection), the wait time would not be honored.
A message could be overwritten quickly.  Now compute the remaining waiting
time.

Windows: Completing "\\share\c$\S" inserted a backslash before the $ and then
the name is invalid.  Don't insert the backslash.

When doing an auto-write before ":make", IObuff was overwritten and the wrong
text displayed later.

On the Mac the directories "c:/tmp" and "c:/temp" were used in the defaults
for 'backupdir' and 'directory', they don't exist.

The check for a new file not to be on an MS-DOS filesystem created the file
temporarily, which can be slow.  Don't do this if there is another check for
the swap file being on an MS-DOS filesystem.

Don't give the "Changing a readonly file" warning when reading from stdin.

When using the "Save As" menu entry and not entering a file name, would get an
error message for the trailing ":edit #".  Now only do that when the
alternate file name was changed.

When Vim owns the X11 selection and is being suspended, an application that
tries to use the selection hangs.  When Vim continues it could no longer
obtain the selection.  Now give up the selection when suspending.

option.h and globals.h were included in some files, while they were already
included in vim.h.  Moved the definition of EXTERN to vim.h to avoid doing it
twice.

When repeating an operator that used a search pattern and the search pattern
contained characters that have a special meaning on the cmdline (e.g., CTRL-U)
it didn't work.

Fixed various problems with using K_SPECIAL (0x80) and CSI (0x9b) as a byte in
a (multibyte) character.  For example, the "r" command could not be repeated.

The DOS/Windows install program didn't always work from a directory with a
long filename, because $VIM and the executable name would not have the same
path.

Multi-byte:
- Using an any-but character range [^x] in a regexp didn't work for UTF-8.
  (Muraoka Taro)
- When backspacing over inserted characters in Replace mode multi-byte
  characters were not handled correctly. (Muraoka Taro)
- Search commands "#" and "*" didn't work with multibyte characters. (Muraoka
  Taro)
- Word completion in Insert mode didn't work with multibyte characters.
  (Muraoka Taro)
- Athena/Motif GUI: when 'linespace' is non-zero the cursor would be drawn too
  wide (number of bytes instead of cell width).
- When changing 'encoding' to "euc-jp" and inserting a character Vim would
  crash.
- For euc-jp characters positioning the cursor would sometimes be wrong.
  Also, with two characters with 0x8e leading byte only the first one would be
  displayed.
- When using DYNAMIC_ICONV on Win32 conversion might fail because of using the
  wrong error number. (Muraoka Taro)
- Using Alt-x in the GUI while 'encoding' was set to "utf-8" didn't produce
  the right character.
- When using Visual block selection and only the left halve of a double-wide
  character is selected, the highlighting continued to the end of the line.
- Visual-block delete didn't work properly when deleting the right halve of a
  double-wide character.
- Overstrike mode for the cmdline replaced only the first byte of a multibyte
  character.
- The cursor in Replace mode (also in the cmdline) was to small on a
  double-wide character.
- When a multibyte character contained a 0x80 byte, it didn't work (was using
  a CSI byte instead). (Muraoka Taro)
- Wordwise selection with the mouse didn't work.
- Yanking a modeless selection of multi-byte characters didn't work.
- When 'selection' is "exclusive", selecting a word that ends in a multi-byte
  character used wrong highlighting for the following character.

Win32 with Make_mvc.mak: Didn't compile for debugging. (Craig Barkhouse)

Win32 GUI: When "vimrun.exe" is used to execute an external command, don't
give a message box with the return value, it was already printed by vimrun.
Also avoid printing the return value of the shell when ":silent!" is used.

Win32: selecting a lot of text and using the "find/replace" dialog caused a
crash.

X11 GUI: When typing a character with the 8th bit set and the Meta/Alt
modifier, the modifier was removed without changing the character.

Truncating a message to make it fit on the command line, using "..." for the
middle, didn't always compute the space correctly.

Could not imap <C-@>.  Now it works like <Nul>.

VMS:
- Fixed a few things for VAXC.  os_vms_fix.com had some strange CTRL-M
  characters. (Zoltan Arpadffy and John W. Hamill)
- Added VMS-specific defaults for the 'isfname' and 'isprint' options.
  (Zoltan Arpadffy)
- Removed os_vms_osdef.h, it's no longer used.

The gzip plugin used a ":normal" command, this doesn't work when dropping a
compressed file on Vim.

In very rare situations a binary search for a tag would fail, because an
uninitialized value happens to be half the size of the tag file. (Narendran)

When using BufEnter and BufLeave autocommands to enable/disable a menu, it
wasn't updated right away.

When doing a replace with the "c"onfirm flag, the cursor was positioned after
the ruler, instead of after the question.  With a long replacement string the
screen could scroll up and cause a "more" prompt.  Now the message is
truncated to make it fit.

Motif: The autoconf check for the Xp library didn't work.

When 'verbose' is set to list lines of a sourced file, defining a function
would reset the counter used for the "more" prompt.

In the Win32 find/replace dialog, a '/' character caused problems.  Escape it
with a backslash.

Starting a shell with ":sh" was different from starting a shell for CTRL-Z
when suspending doesn't work.  They now work the same way.

Jumping to a file mark while in a changed buffer gave a "mark not set" error.

":execute histget("cmd")" causes an endless loop and crashed Vim.  Now catch
all commands that cause too much recursiveness.

Removed "Failed to open input method" error message, too many people got this
when they didn't want to use a XIM.

GUI: When compiled without the +windows feature, the scrollbar would start
below line one.

Removed the trick with redefining character class functions from regexp.c.

Win32 GUI: Find dialog gives focus back to main window, when typing a
character mouse pointer is blanked, it didn't reappear when moving it in the
dialog window. (Vince Negri)

When recording and typing a CTRL-C, no character was recorded.  When in Insert
mode or cancelling half a command, playing back the recorded sequence wouldn't
work.  Now record the CTRL-C.

When the GUI was started, mouse codes for DEC and netterm were still checked
for.

GUI: When scrolling and 'writedelay' is non-zero, the character under the
cursor was displayed in the wrong position (one line above/below with
CTRL-E/CTRL-Y).

A ":normal" command would reset the 'scrollbind' info.  Causes problems when
using a ":normal" command in an autocommand for opening a file.

Windows GUI: a point size with a dot, like "7.5", wasn't recognized. (Muraoka
Taro)

When 'scrollbind' wasn't set would still remember the current position,
wasting time.

GTK: Crash when 'shell' doesn't exist and doing":!ls".  Use _exit() instead of
exit() when the child couldn't execute the shell.

Multi-byte:
- GUI with double-byte encoding: a mouse click in left halve of double-wide
  character put the cursor in previous char.
- Using double-byte encoding and 'selection' is "exclusive": "vey" and "^Vey"
  included the character after the word.
- When using a double-byte encoding and there is a lead byte at the end of the
  line, the preceding line would be displayed.  "ga" also showed wrong info.
- "gf" didn't include multi-byte characters before the cursor properly.
  (Muraoka Taro)

GUI: The cursor was sometimes not removed when scrolling.  Changed the policy
from redrawing the cursor after each call to gui_write() to only update it at
the end of update_screen() or when setting the cursor position.  Also only
update the scrollbars at the end of update_screen(), that's the only place
where the window text may have been scrolled.

Formatting "/*<Tab>long text", produced "* <Tab>" in the next line.  Now
remove the space before the Tab.
Formatting "/*<Tab>  long text", produced "* <Tab> long text" in the next
line.  Now keep the space after the Tab.

In some places non-ASCII alphabetical characters were accepted, which could
cause problems.  For example, ":X" (X being such a character).

When a pattern matches the end of the line, the last character in the line was
highlighted for 'hlsearch'.  That looks wrong for "/\%3c".  Now highlight the
character just after the line.

Motif: If a dialog was closed by clicking on the "X" of the window frame Vim
would no longer respond.

When using CTRL-X or CTRL-A on a number with many leading zeros, Vim would
crash. (Matsumoto)

When 'insertmode' is set, the mapping in mswin.vim for CTRL-V didn't work in
Select mode.  Insert mode wasn't restarted after overwriting the text.
Now allow nesting Insert mode with insert and change commands.  CTRL-O
cwfoo<Esc> now also works.

Clicking with the right mouse button in another window started Visual mode,
but used the start position of the current window.  Caused ml_get errors when
the line number was invalid.  Now stay in the same window.

When 'selection' is "exclusive", "gv" sometimes selected one character fewer.

When 'comments' contains more than one start/middle/end triplet, the optional
flags could be mixed up.  Also didn't align the end with the middle part.

Double-right-click in Visual mode didn't update the shown mode.

When the Normal group has a font name, it was never used when starting up.
Now use it when 'guifont' and 'guifontset' are empty.
Setting a font name to a highlight group before the GUI was started didn't
work.

"make test" didn't use the name of the generated Vim executable.

'cindent' problems:
- Aligned with an "else" inside a do-while loop for a line below that loop.
  (Meikel Brandmeyer)
- A line before a function would be indented even when terminated with a
  semicolon. (Meikel Brandmeyer)
- 'cindent' gave too much indent to a line after a "};" that ends an array
  init.
- Support declaration lines ending in "," and "\".  (Meikel Brandmeyer)
- A case statement inside a do-while loop was used for indenting a line after
  the do-while loop. (Meikel Brandmeyer)
- When skipping a string in a line with one double quote it could continue in
  the previous line. (Meikel Brandmeyer)

When 'list' is set, 'hlsearch' didn't highlight a match at the end of the
line.  Now highlight the '$'.

The Paste menu item in the menu bar, the popup menu and the toolbar were all
different.  Now made them all equal to how it was done in mswin.vim.

st_dev can be smaller than "unsigned".  The compiler may give an overflow
warning.  Added a configure check for dev_t.

Athena: closing a confirm() dialog killed Vim.

Various typos in the documentation. (Matt Dunford)

Python interface: The definition of _DEBUG could cause trouble, undefine it.
The error message for not being able to load the shared library wasn't
translated.  (Muraoka Taro)

Mac: (Dany St-Amant and Axel Kielhorn)
- Several fixes.
- Vim was eating 80% of the CPU time.
- The project os_mac.pbxproj didn't work,  Moved it to a subdirectory.
- Made the menu priority work for the menubar.
- Fixed a problem with dragging the scrollbar.
- Cleaned up the various #ifdefs.

Unix: When catching a deadly signal and we keep getting one use _exit() to
exit in a quick and dirty way.

Athena menu ordering didn't work correctly. (David Harrison)

A ":make" or ":grep" command with a long argument could cause a crash.

Doing ":new file" and using "Quit" for the ATTENTION dialog still opened a new
window.

GTK: When starting the GUI and there is an error in the .vimrc file, don't
present the wait-return prompt, since the message was given in the terminal.

When there was an error in a .vimrc file the terminal where gvim was started
could be cleared.  Set msg_row in main.c before writing any messages.

GTK and X11 GUI: When trying to read characters from the user (e.g. with
input()) before the Vim window was opened caused Vim to hang when it was
started from the desktop.

OS/390 uses 31 bit pointers.  That broke some computations with MAX_COL.
Reduce MAX_COL by one bit for OS/390. (Ralf Schandl)

When defining a function and it already exists, Vim didn't say it existed
until after typing it.  Now do this right away when typing it.

The message remembered for displaying later (keep_msg) was sometimes pointing
into a generic buffer, which might be changed by the time the message is
displayed.  Now make a copy of the message.

When using multi-byte characters in a menu and a trailing byte is a backslash,
the menu would not be created correctly.  (Muraoka Taro)
Using a multibyte character in the substitute string where a trail byte is a
backslash didn't work.  (Muraoka Taro)

When setting "t_Co" in a vimrc file, then setting it automatically from an
xterm termresponse and then setting it again manually caused a crash.

When getting the value of a string option that is not supported, the number
zero was returned.  This breaks a check like "&enc == "asdf".  Now an empty
string is returned for string options.

Crashed when starting the GTK GUI while using 'notitle' in the vimrc, setting
'title' in the gvimrc and starting the GUI with ":gui".  Closed the connection
to the X server accidentally.

Had to hit return after selecting an entry for ":ts".

The message from ":cn" message was sometimes cleared.  Now display it after
redrawing if it doesn't cause a scroll (truncated when necessary).

hangulin.c didn't compile when the GUI was disabled.  Disable it when it won't
work.

When setting a termcap option like "t_CO", the value could be displayed as
being for a normal key with a modifier, like "<M-=>".

When expanding the argument list, entries which are a directory name did not
get included.  This stopped "vim c:/" from opening the file explorer.

":syn match sd "^" nextgroup=asdf" skipped the first column and matched the
nextgroup in the second column.

GUI: When 'lazyredraw' is set, 'showmatch' didn't work.  Required flushing
the output.

Don't define the <NetMouse> termcode in an xterm, reduces the problem when
someone types <Esc> } in Insert mode.

Made slash_adjust() work correctly for multi-byte characters. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)
Using a filename in Big5 encoding for autocommands didn't work (backslash in
trailbyte).  (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

DOS and Windows: Expanding *.vim also matched file.vimfoo.  Expand path like
Unix to avoid problems with Windows dir functions.  Merged the DOS and Win32
functions.

Win32: Gvimext could not edit more than a few files at once, the length of the
argument was fixed.

"ls -1 * | xargs vim" worked, but the input was in cooked mode.  Now switch to
raw mode when needed.  Use dup() to copy the stderr file descriptor to stdin
to make shell commands work.  No longer requires an external program to do
this.

When using ":filetype off", ftplugin and indent usage would be switched off at
the same time.  Don't do this, setting 'filetype' manually can still use them.

GUI: When writing a double-byte character, it could be split up in two calls
to gui_write(), which doesn't work.  Now flush before the output buffer
becomes full.

When 'laststatus' is set and 'cmdheight' is two or bigger, the intro message
would be written over the status line.
The ":intro" command didn't work when there wasn't enough room.

Configuring for Ruby failed with a recent version of Ruby. (Akinori Musha)

Athena: When deleting the directory in which Vim was started, using the file
browser made Vim exit.  Removed the use of XtAppError().

When using autoconf 2.50, UNIX was not defined.  Moved the comment for "#undef
UNIX" to a separate line.

Win32: Disabled _OnWindowPosChanging() to make maximize work better.

Win32: Compiling with VC 4.0 didn't work. (Walter Briscoe)

Athena:
- Finally fixed the problems with deleting a menu. (David Harrison)
- Athena: When closing the confirm() dialog, worked like OK was pressed,
  instead of Cancel.

The file explorer didn't work in compatible mode, because of line
continuation.

Didn't give an error message for ":digraph a".

When using Ex mode in the GUI and typing a special key, <BS> didn't delete it
correctly.  Now display '?' for a special key.

When an operator is pending, clicking in another window made it apply to that
window, even though the line numbers could be beyond the end of the buffer.

When a function call doesn't have a terminating ")" Vim could crash.

Perl interface: could crash on exit with perl 5.6.1. (Anduin Withers)

Using %P in 'errorformat' wasn't handled correctly. (Tomas Zellerin)

Using a syntax cluster that includes itself made Vim crash.

GUI: With 'ls' set to 2, dragging the status line all the way up, then making
the Vim window smaller: Could not the drag status line anymore.

"vim -c startinsert! file" placed cursor on last char of a line, instead of
after it.  A ":set" command in the buffer menu set w_set_curswant.  Now don't
do this when w_curswant is MAXCOL.

Win32: When the gvim window was maximized and selecting another font, the
window would no longer fill the screen.

The line with 'pastetoggle' in ":options" didn't show the right value when it
is a special key.  Hitting <CR> didn't work either.

Formatting text, resulting in a % landing in the first line, repeated the % in
the following lines, like it's the start of a comment.

GTK: When adding a toolbar item while gvim is already running, it wasn't
possible to use the tooltip.  Now it works by adding the tooltip first.

The output of "g CTRL-G" mentioned "Char" but it's actually bytes.

Searching for the end of a oneline region didn't work correctly when there is
an offset for the highlighting.

Syntax highlighting: When synchronizing on C-comments, //*/ was seen as the
start of a comment.

Win32: Without scrollbars present, the MS mouse scroll wheel didn't work.
Also handle the scrollbars when they are not visible.

Motif: When there is no right scrollbar, the bottom scrollbar would still
leave room for it.  (Marcin Dalecki)

When changing 'guicursor' and the value is invalid, some of the effects would
still take place.  Now first check for errors and only make the new value
effective when it's OK.

Using "A" In Visual block mode, appending to lines that don't extend into the
block, padding was wrong.

When pasting a block of text, a character that occupies more than one screen
column could be deleted and spaces inserted instead.  Now only do that with a
tab.

Fixed conversion of documentation to HTML using Perl. (Dan Sharp)

Give an error message when a menu name starts with a dot.

Avoid a hang when executing a shell from the GUI on HP-UX by pushing "ptem"
even when sys/ptem.h isn't present.

When creating the temp directory, make sure umask is 077, otherwise the
directory is not accessible when it was set to 0177.

Unix: When resizing the window and a redraw is a bit slow, could get a window
resize event while redrawing, resulting in a messed up window.  Any input
(e.g., a mouse click) would redraw.

The "%B" item in the status line became zero in Insert mode (that's normal)
for another than the current window.

The menu entries to convert to xxd and back didn't work in Insert mode.

When ":vglobal" didn't find a line where the pattern doesn't match, the error
message would be the wrong way around.

When ignoring a multi-line error message with "%-A", the continuation lines
would be used anyway. (Servatius Brandt)

"grx" on a double-wide character inserted "x", instead of replacing the
character with "x ".  "gR" on <xx> ('display' set the "uhex") didn't replace
at all.  When doing "gRxx" on a control character the first "x" would be
inserted, breaking the alignment.

Added "0)" to 'cinkeys', so that when typing a ) it is put in the same place
as where "==" would put it.

Win32: When maximized, adding/removing toolbar didn't resize the text area.

When using <C-RightMouse> a count was discarded.

When typing CTRL-V and <RightMouse> in the command line, would insert
<LeftMouse>.

Using "vis" or "vas" when 'selection' is exclusive didn't include the last
character.

When adding to an option like 'grepprg', leading space would be lost.  Don't
expand environment variables when there is no comma separating the items.

GUI: When using a bold-italic font, would still use the bold trick and
underlining.

Motif: The default button didn't work in dialogs, the first one was always
used.  Had to give input focus to the default button.

When using CTRL-T to jump within the same file, the '' mark wasn't set.

Undo wasn't Vi compatible when using the 'c' flag for ":s".  Now it undoes the
whole ":s" command instead of each confirmed replacement.

The Buffers menu, when torn-off, disappeared when being refreshed.  Add a
dummy item to avoid this.

Removed calling msg_start() in main(), it should not be needed.

vim_strpbrk() did not support multibyte characters. (Muraoka Taro)

The Amiga version didn't compile, the code was too big for relative jumps.
Moved a few files from ex_docmd.c to ex_cmds2.c

When evaluating the "= register resulted in the "= register being changed, Vim
would crash.

When doing ":view file" and it fails, the current buffer was made read-only.

Motif: For some people the separators in the toolbar disappeared when resizing
the Vim window. (Marcin Dalecki)

Win32 GUI: when setting 'lines' to a huge number, would not compute the
available space correctly.  Was counting the menu height twice.

Conversion of the docs to HTML didn't handle the line with the +quickfix tag
correctly. (Antonio Colombo)

Win32: fname_case() didn't handle multi-byte characters correctly. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

The Cygwin version had trouble with fchdir().  Don't use that function for
Cygwin.

The generic check in scripts.vim for "conf" syntax was done before some checks
in filetype.vim, resulting in "conf" syntax too often.

Dos32: Typing lagged behind.  Would wait for one biostick when checking if a
character is available.

GTK: When setting 'columns' while starting up "gvim", would set the width of
the terminal it was started in.

When using ESC in Insert mode, an autoindent that wraps to the next line
caused the cursor to move to the end of the line temporarily.  When the
character before the cursor was a double-wide multi-byte character the cursor
would be on the right halve, which causes problems with some terminals.

Didn't handle multi-byte characters correctly when expanding a file name.
(Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Win32 GUI: Errors generated before the GUI is decided to start were not
reported.

globpath() didn't reserve enough room for concatenated results. (Anduin
Withers)

When expanding an option that is very long already, don't do the expansion, it
would be truncated to MAXPATHL. (Anduin Withers)

When 'selection' is "exclusive", using "Fx" in Visual mode only moved until
just after the character.

When using IME on the console to enter a file name, the screen may scroll up.
Redraw the screen then. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Motif: In the find/replace dialog the "Replace" button didn't work first time,
second time it replaced all matches.  Removed the use of ":s///c".
GTK: Similar problems with the find/replace dialog, moved the code to a common
function.

X11: Use shared GC's for text. (Marcin Dalecki)

"]i" found the match under the cursor, instead of the first one below it.
Same for "]I", "] CTRL-I", "]d", "]D" and "] CTRL-D".

Win16: When maximized and the font is changed, don't change the window size.
(Vince Negri)

When 'lbr' is set, deleting a block of text could leave the cursor in the
wrong position.

Win32: When opening a file with the "Edit with Vim" popup menu entry,
wildcards would cause trouble.  Added the "--literal" argument to avoid
expanding file names.

When using "gv", it didn't restore that "$" was used in Visual block mode.

Win32 GUI: While waiting for a shell command to finish, the window wasn't
redrawn at all. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Syntax highlighting: A match that continues on a next line because of a
contained region didn't end when that region ended.

The ":s" command didn't allow flags like 'e' and 'i' right after it.

When using ":s" to split a line, marks were moved to the next line.  Vi keeps
them in the first line.

When using ":n" ":rew", the previous context mark was at the top of the file,
while Vi puts it in the same place as the cursor.  Made it Vi compatible.

Fixed Vi incompatibility: Text was not put in register 1 when using "c" and
"d" with a motion character, when deleting within one line with one of the
commands: % ( ) `<character> / ? N n { }

Win32 GUI: The tooltip for tear-off items remained when the tear-off item was
no longer selected.

GUI: When typing ":" at the more prompt, would return to Normal mode and not
redraw the screen.

When starting Vim with an argument "-c g/at/p" the printed lines would
overwrite each other.

BeOS: Didn't compile.  Configure didn't add the os_beos files, the QNX check
removed them.  Various changes to os_beos.cc. (Joshua Haberman)
Removed the check for the hardware platform, the BeBox has not been produced
for a long time now.

Win32 GUI: don't use a message box when the shell returns an error code,
display the message in the Vim window.

Make_mvc.mak always included "/debug" for linking.  "GUI=no" argument didn't
work.  Use "DEBUG=yes" instead of "DEBUG=1" to make it consistent. (Dan Sharp)

When a line in the tags file ended in ;" (no TAB following) the command would
not be recognized as a search command.

X11: The inputMethod resource never worked.  Don't use the "none" input method
for SGI, it apparently makes the first character in Input method dropped.

Fixed incorrect tests in os_mac.h. (Axel Kielhorn)

Win32 console: When the console where Vim runs in is closed, Vim could hang in
trying to restore the window icon. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

When using ":3call func()" or ":3,3call func() the line number was ignored.

When 'showbreak' and 'linebreak' were both set, Visual highlighting sometimes
continued until the end of the line.

GTK GUI: Tearoff items were added even when 'guioptions' didn't contain 't'
when starting up.

MS-Windows: When the current directory includes a "~", searching files with
"gf" or ":find" didn't work.  A "$" in the directory had the same problem.
Added mch_has_exp_wildcard() functions.

When reducing the Vim window height while starting up, would get an
out-of-memory error message.

When editing a very long search pattern, 'incsearch' caused the redraw of the
command line to fail.

Motif GUI: On some systems the "Help" menu would not be on the far right, as
it should be.  On some other systems (esp. IRIX) the command line would not
completely show.  Solution is to only resize the menubar for Lesstif.

Using "%" in a line that contains "\\" twice didn't take care of the quotes
properly.  Now make a difference between \" and \\".

For non-Unix systems a dummy file is created when finding a swap name to
detect a 8.3 filesystem.  When there is an existing swap file, would get a
warning for the file being created outside of Vim.  Also, when closing the Vim
window the file would remain.

Motif: The menu height was always computed, using a "-menuheight" argument
was setting the room for the command line.  Now make clear the argument is not
supported.

For some (EBCDIC) systems, POUND was equal to '#'.  Added an #if for that to
avoid a duplicate case in a switch.

The GUI may have problems when forking.  Always call _exit() instead of exit()
in the parent, the child will call exit().

Win32 GUI: Accented characters were often wrong in dialogs and tearoff menus.
Now use CP_ACP instead of CP_OEMCP. (Vince Negri)

When displaying text with syntax highlighting causes an error (e.g., running
out of stack) the syntax highlighting is disabled to avoid further messages.

When a command in a .vimrc or .gvimrc causes an ATTENTION prompt, and Vim was
started from the desktop (no place to display messages) it would hang.  Now
open the GUI window early to be able to display the messages and pop up the
dialog.

"r<CR>" on a multi-byte character deleted only the first byte of the
character.  "3r<CR>" deleted three bytes instead of three characters.

When interrupting reading a file, Vi considers the buffer modified.  Added the
'i' flag in 'cpoptions' flag for this (we don't want it modified to be able to
do ":q").

When using an item in 'guicursor' that starts with a colon, Vim would get
stuck or crash.

When putting a file mark in a help file and later jumping back to it, the
options would not be set.  Extended the modeline in all help files to make
this work better.

When a modeline contained "::" the local option values would be printed.  Now
ignore it.

Some help files did not use a 8.3 names, which causes problems when using
MS-DOS unzip.  Renamed "multibyte.txt" to "mbyte.txt", "rightleft.txt" to
"rileft.txt", "tagsearch.txt" to "tagsrch.txt", "os_riscos.txt" to
"os_risc.txt".

When Visual mode is blockwise, using "iw" or "aw" made it characterwise.  That
doesn't seem right, only do this when in linewise mode.  But then do it
always, not only when start and end of Visual mode are equal.

When using "viw" on a single-letter word and 'selection' is exclusive, would
not include the word.

When formatting text from Insert mode, using CTRL-O, could mess up undo
information.

While writing a file (also for the backup file) there was no check for an
interrupt (hitting CTRL-C).  Vim could hang when writing a large file over a
slow network, and moving the mouse didn't make it appear (when 'mousehide' is
set) and the screen wasn't updated in the GUI.  Also allow interrupting when
syncing the swap file, it can take a long time.

When using ":mksession" while there is help window, it would later be restored
to the right file but not marked as a help buffer.  ":help" would then open
another window.  Now use the value "help" for 'buftype' to mark a help buffer.

The session file contained absolute path names in option values, that doesn't
work when the home directory depends on the situation.  Replace the home
directory with ~/ when possible.

When using 'showbreak' a TAB just after the shown break would not be counted
correctly, the cursor would be positioned wrong.

With 'showbreak' set to "--->" or "------->" and 'sts' set to 4, inserting
tabs did not work right.  Could cause a crash.  Backspacing was also wrong,
could get stuck at a line break.

Win32: crashed when tearing off a menu with over 300 items.

GUI: A menu or toolbar item would appear when only a tooltip was defined for
it.

When 'scrolloff' is non-zero and "$" is in 'cpoptions', using "s" while the
last line of the file is the first line on screen, the text wasn't displayed.

When running "autoconf", delete the configure cache to force starting cleanly
when configure is run again.

When changing the Normal colors for cterm, the value of 'background' was
changed even when the GUI was used.

The warning for a missing vimrun.exe was always given on startup, but some
people just editing a file don't need to be bothered by it.  Only show it when
vimrun would be used.

When using "%" in a multibyte text it could get confused by trailbytes that
match. (Muraoka Taro)

Termcap entry for RiscOS was wrong, using 7 and 8 in octal codes.

Athena: The title of a dialog window and the file selector window were not
set. (David Harrison)

The "htmlLink" highlight group specified colors, which gives problems when
using a color scheme.  Added the "Underlined" highlight group for this.

After using ":insert" or ":change" the '[ mark would be one line too low.

When looking for the file name after a match with 'include' one character was
skipped.  Same for 'define'.

Win32 and DJGPP: When editing a file with a short name in a directory, and
editing the same file but using the long name, would end up with two buffers
on the same file.

"gf" on a filename that starts with "../" only worked when the file being
edited is in the current directory.  An include file search didn't work
properly for files starting with "../" or ".".  Now search both relative to
the file and to the current directory.

When 'printheader', 'titlestring', 'iconstring', 'rulerformat' or 'statusline'
contained "%{" but no following "}" memory was corrupted and a crash could
happen.

":0append" and then inserting two lines did not redraw the blank lines that
were scrolled back down.

When using insert mode completion in a narrow window, the message caused a
scroll up.  Now shorten the message if it doesn't fit and avoid writing the
ruler over the message.

XIM still didn't work correctly on some systems, especially SGI/IRIX.  Added
the 'imdisable' option, which is set by default for that system.

Patch 6.0aw.008
Problem:    When the first character of a file name is over 127, the Buffers
	    menu entry would get a negative priority and cause problems.
Solution:   Reduce the multiplier for the first character when computing
	    the hash value for a Buffers menu entry.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0aw.010
Problem:    Win32: ":browse edit dir/dir" didn't work. (Vikas)

	    browser.
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Athena file browser: On some systems wcstombs() can't be used to get the
length of a multi-byte string.  Use the maximum length then. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

Patch 6.0ax.001

Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.0ax.002

Solution:   Create the original file before decompressing.
Files:	    runtime/plugin/gzip.vim

Patch 6.0ax.005
Problem:    Athena file selector keeps the title of the first invocation.

	    Harrison)
Files:	    src/gui_at_fs.c

Patch 6.0ax.007

	    interpreted as a scroll wheel click.
Solution:   Check if GPM is being used when deciding if a mouse event is for
	    the scroll wheel.
Files:	    src/term.c

Patch 6.0ax.010
Problem:    The Edit.Save menu and the Save toolbar button didn't work when
	    the buffer has no file name.
Solution:   Use a file browser to ask for a file name.  Also fix the toolbar
	    Find item in Visual mode.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0ax.012
Problem:    When 'cpoptions' contains "$", breaking a line for 'textwidth'
	    doesn't redraw properly. (Stefan Schulze)
Solution:   Remove the dollar before breaking the line.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.0ax.014
Problem:    Win32: On Windows 98 ":make -f file" doesn't work when 'shell' is
	    "command.com" and 'makeprg' is "nmake".  The environment isn't
	    passed on to "nmake".
Solution:   Also use vimrun.exe when redirecting the output of a command.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.0ax.016
Problem:    The version number was reported wrong in the intro screen.
Solution:   Check for a version number with two additional letters.
Files:	    src/version.c

Patch 6.0ax.019
Problem:    When scrolling a window with folds upwards, switching to another
	    vertically split window and back may not update the scrollbar.

Fixed							*fixed-6.1*
-----

The license text was updated to make the meaning clearer and make it
compatible with the GNU GPL.  Otherwise distributors have a problem when
linking Vim with a GPL'ed library.

When installing the "less.sh" script it was not made executable. (Chuck Berg)

Win32: The "9" key on the numpad wasn't working. (Julian Kinraid)

The NSIS install script didn't work with NSIS 1.80 or later.  Also add
Vim-specific icons. (Pruchnik)

The script for conversion to HTML contained an "if" in the wrong place.
(Michael Geddes)

Allow using ":ascii" in the sandbox, it's harmless.

Removed creat() from osdef2.h.in, it wasn't used and may cause a problem when
it's redefined to creat64().

The text files in the VisVim directory were in "dos" format.  This caused
problems when applying a patch.  Now keep them in "unix" format and convert
them to "dos" format only for the PC archives.

Add ruby files to the dos source archive, they can be used by Make_mvc.mak.
(Mirek Pruchnik)

"cp -f" doesn't work on all systems.  Change "cp -f" in the Makefile to "rm
-f" and "cp".

Didn't compile on a Compaq Tandem Himalaya OSS. (Michael A. Benzinger)

The GTK file selection dialog didn't include the "Create Dir", "Delete File"
and "Rename File" buttons.

When doing ":browse source" the dialog has the title "Run Macro".  Better
would be "Source Vim script". (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Win32: Don't use the printer font as default for the font dialog.

"make doslang" didn't work when configure didn't run (yet).  Set $MAKEMO to
"yes". (Mirek Pruchnik)

The ToolBar TagJump item used "g]", which prompts for a selection even when
there is only one matching tag.  Use "g<C-]>" instead.

The ming makefile for message translations didn't have the right list of
files.

The MS-Windows 3.1 version complains about LIBINTL.DLL not found.  Compile
this version without message translations.

The Borland 5 makefile contained a check for Ruby which is no longer needed.
The URLs for the TCL library was outdated. (Dan Sharp)

The eviso.ps file was missing from the DOS runtime archive, it's needed for
printing PostScript in the 32bit DOS version.

In menu files ":scriptencoding" was used in a wrong way after patch 6.1a.032
Now use ":scriptencoding" in the file where the translations are given.  Do
the same for all menus in latin1 encoding.

Included a lot of fixes for the Macintosh, mostly to make it work with Carbon.
(Dany StAmant, Axel Kielhorn, Benji Fisher)

Improved the vimtutor shell script to use $TMPDIR when it exists, and delete
the copied file when exiting in an abnormal way. (Max Ischenko)

When "iconv.dll" can't be found, try using "libiconv.dll".

When encryption is used, filtering with a shell command wasn't possible.

DJGPP: ":cd c:" always failed, can't get permissions for "c:".
Win32: ":cd c:/" failed if the previous current directory on c: had become
invalid.

DJGPP: Shift-Del and Del both produce \316\123.  Default mapping for Del is
wrong.  Disabled it.

Dependencies on header files in MingW makefile was wrong.

Win32: Don't use ACL stuff for MSVC 4.2, it's not supported. (Walter Briscoe)

Win32 with Borland: bcc.cfg was caching the value for $(BOR), but providing a
different argument to make didn't regenerate it.

Win32 with MSVC: Make_ivc.mak generates a new if_ole.h in a different
directory, the if_ole.h in the src directory may be used instead.  Delete the
distributed file.

When a window is vertically split and then ":ball" is used, the window layout
is messed up, can cause a crash. (Muraoka Taro)

When 'insertmode' is set, using File/New menu and then double clicking, "i" is
soon inserted. (Merlin Hansen)

When Select mode is active and using the Buffers menu to switch to another
buffer, an old selection comes back.  Reset VIsual_reselect for a ":buffer"
command.

When Select mode is active and 'insertmode' is set, using the Buffers menu to
switch to another buffer, did not return to Insert mode.  Make sure
"restart_edit" is set.

When double clicking on the first character of a word while 'selection' is
"exclusive" didn't select that word.

Patch 6.0.006
Problem:    With a vertical split, 'number' set and 'scrolloff' non-zero,

	    Lindstrom)
Solution:   Check for a zero width.
Files:	    src/move.c

Patch 6.0.007
Problem:    When setting 'filetype' while there is no FileType autocommand, a

Problem:    OS/2, MS-DOS and MS-Windows: Using a path that starts with a
	    slash in 'tags' doesn't work as expected. (Mathias Koehrer)
Solution:   Only use the drive, not the whole path to the current directory.
	    Also make it work for "c:dir/file".
Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.0.037
Problem:    When the user has set "did_install_syntax_menu" to avoid the
	    default Syntax menu it still appears. (Virgilio)
Solution:   Don't add the three default items when "did_install_syntax_menu"
	    is set.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0.038
Problem:    When 'selection' is "exclusive", deleting a block of text at the
	    end of a line can leave the cursor beyond the end of the line.
Solution:   Correct the cursor position.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.039
Problem:    "gP" leaves the cursor in the wrong position when 'virtualedit' is
	    used.  Using "c" in blockwise Visual mode leaves the cursor in a
	    strange position.
Solution:   For "gP" reset the "coladd" field for the '] mark.  For "c" leave
	    the cursor on the last inserted character.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.043
Problem:    Patch 6.0.041 was wrong.
Solution:   Use mch_getenv() instead of vim_getenv().
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.0.044
Problem:    Using a "containedin" list for a syntax item doesn't work for an
	    item that doesn't have a "contains" argument.  Also, "containedin"
	    doesn't ignore a transparent item. (Timo Frenay)
Solution:   When there is a "containedin" argument somewhere, always check for
	    contained items.  Don't check for the transparent item but the
	    item it's contained in.
Files:	    src/structs.h, src/syntax.c

Patch 6.0.045
Problem:    After creating a fold with a Visual selection, another window
	    with the same buffer still has inverted text. (Sami Salonen)

Problem:    Using a regexp with "\(\)" inside a "\%[]" item causes a crash.
	    (Samuel Lacas)
Solution:   Don't allow nested atoms inside "\%[]".
Files:	    src/regexp.c

Patch 6.0.048
Problem:    Win32: In the console the mouse doesn't always work correctly.
	    Sometimes after getting focus a mouse movement is interpreted like
	    a button click.
Solution:   Use a different function to obtain the number of mouse buttons.
	    Avoid recognizing a button press from undefined bits. (Vince Negri)
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.0.049
Problem:    When using evim the intro screen is misleading. (Adrian Nagle)
Solution:   Mention whether 'insertmode' is set and the menus to be used.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim, src/version.c

Patch 6.0.050
Problem:    UTF-8: "viw" doesn't include non-ASCII characters before the
	    cursor. (Bertilo Wennergren)

Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.052
Problem:    The check for rlim_t in patch 6.0.046 does not work on some
	    systems. (Zdenek Sekera)

Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in

Patch 6.0.053 (extra)
Problem:    Various problems with QNX.
Solution:   Minor fix for configure.  Switch on terminal clipboard support in

Solution:   Escape spaces with backslashes, like for ":set path=".  Also take
	    backslashes into account when searching for the start of the path
	    to complete (e.g., for 'backupdir' and 'cscopeprg').

Patch 6.0.135
Problem:    Menus that are not supposed to do anything used "<Nul>", which
	    still produced an error beep.
	    When CTRL-O is mapped for Insert mode, ":amenu" commands didn't
	    work in Insert mode.
	    Menu language falls back to English when $LANG ends in "@euro".
Solution:   Use "<Nop>" for a menu item that doesn't do anything, just like
	    mappings.
	    Use ":anoremenu" instead of ":amenu".
	    Ignore "@euro" in the locale name.
Files:	    runtime/makemenu.vim, runtime/menu.vim, src/menu.c

Patch 6.0.136
Problem:    When completing in Insert mode, a mapping could be unexpectedly

Patch 6.0.137
Problem:    GUI: When using the find or find/replace dialog from Insert mode,
	    the input mode is stopped.
Solution:   Don't use the input method status when the main window doesn't
	    have focus.
Files:	    src/ui.c

Patch 6.0.138
Problem:    GUI: When using the find or find/replace dialog from Insert mode,
	    the text is inserted when CTRL-O is mapped. (Andre Pang)
	    When opening the dialog again, a whole word search isn't
	    recognized.
	    When doing "replace all" a whole word search was never done.
Solution:   Don't put a search or replace command in the input buffer,
	    execute it directly.
	    Recognize "\<" and "\>" after removing "\V".
	    Add "\<" and "\>" also for "replace all".
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.0.139
Problem:    When stopping 'wildmenu' completion, the statusline of the
	    bottom-left vertically split window isn't redrawn. (Yegappan
	    Lakshmanan)

Solution:   Clear the local mappings when deleting a buffer.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/getchar.c, src/proto/getchar.pro, src/vim.h

Patch 6.0.141
Problem:    When using ":enew" in an empty buffer, some buffer-local things
	    are not cleared.  b:keymap_name is not set.
Solution:   Clear user commands and mappings local to the buffer when re-using
	    the current buffer.  Reload the keymap.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.0.142
Problem:    When Python is linked statically, loading dynamic extensions might

	    may not be updated properly when making a change.
Solution:   Add the "linebreaks" argument to ":syn sync".
Files:	    runtime/doc/syntax.txt, src/screen.c, src/structs.h, src/syntax.c

Patch 6.0.144
Problem:    After patch 6.0.088 redoing "veU" doesn't work.

	    command.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.0.145
Problem:    When Vim can't read any input it might get stuck.  When
	    redirecting stdin and stderr Vim would not read commands from a
	    file.  (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   When repeatedly trying to read a character when it's not possible,
	    exit Vim.  When stdin and stderr are not a tty, still try reading
	    from them, but don't do a blocking wait.
Files:	    src/ui.c

Patch 6.0.146
Problem:    When 'statusline' contains "%{'-'}" this results in a zero.
	    (Milan Vancura)
Solution:   Don't handle numbers with a minus as a number, they were not
	    displayed anyway.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.0.147
Problem:    It's not easy to mark a Vim version as being modified.  The new
	    license requires this.
Solution:   Add the --modified-by argument to configure and the MODIFIED_BY
	    define.  It's used in the intro screen and the ":version" output.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/config.h.in,
	    src/feature.h, src/version.c

Patch 6.0.148
Problem:    After "p" in an empty line, `[ goes to the second character.
	    (Kontra Gergely)
Solution:   Don't increment the column number in an empty line.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.149
Problem:    The pattern "\(.\{-}\)*" causes a hang.  When using a search
	    pattern that causes a stack overflow to be detected Vim could
	    still hang.
Solution:   Correctly report "operand could be empty" when using "\{-}".
	    Check for "out_of_stack" inside loops to avoid a hang.
Files:	    src/regexp.c

Patch 6.0.150
Problem:    When using a multi-byte encoding, patch 6.0.148 causes "p" to work

Solution:   Compute the byte length of a multi-byte character.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.151
Problem:    Redrawing the status line and ruler can be wrong when it contains
	    multi-byte characters.
Solution:   Use character width and byte length correctly. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Patch 6.0.152
Problem:    strtrans() could hang on an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence.
Solution:   Skip over illegal bytes. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/charset.c

Patch 6.0.153
Problem:    When using (illegal) double-byte characters and Vim syntax
	    highlighting Vim can crash. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Solution:   Increase a pointer over a character instead of a byte.
Files:	    src/regexp.c

Patch 6.0.154
Problem:    MS-DOS and MS-Windows: The menu entries for xxd don't work when
	    there is no xxd in the path.
	    When converting back from Hex the filetype may remain "xxd" if it
	    is not detected.
Solution:   When xxd is not in the path use the one in the runtime directory,
	    where the install program has put it.
	    Clear the 'filetype' option before detecting the new value.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0.155

Patch 6.0.156
Problem:    Starting Vim with the -b argument and two files, ":next" doesn't
	    set 'binary' in the second file, like Vim 5.7. (Norman Diamond)
Solution:   Set the global value for 'binary'.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.0.157
Problem:    When defining a user command with "-complete=dir" files will also
	    be expanded.  Also, "-complete=mapping" doesn't appear to work.
	    (Michael Naumann)
Solution:   Use the expansion flags defined with the user command.
	    Handle expanding mappings specifically.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.0.158
Problem:    When getting the warning for a file being changed outside of Vim
	    and reloading the file, the 'readonly' option is reset, even when
	    the permissions didn't change. (Marcel Svitalsky)
Solution:   Keep 'readonly' set when reloading a file and the permissions
	    didn't change.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.0.159
Problem:    Wildcard expansion for ":emenu" also shows separators.
Solution:   Skip menu separators for ":emenu", ":popup" and ":tearoff".
	    Also, don't handle ":tmenu" as if it was ":tearoff".  And leave
	    out the alternatives with "&" included.
Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 6.0.160
Problem:    When compiling with GCC 3.0.2 and using the "-O2" argument, the

Patch 6.0.162
Problem:    Client-server: An error message for a wrong expression appears in
	    the server instead of the client.
Solution:   Pass the error message from the server to the client.  Also
	    adjust the example code. (Flemming Madsen)
Files:	    src/globals.h, src/if_xcmdsrv.c, src/main.c, src/os_mswin.c,

	    runtime/doc/eval.txt, runtime/tools/xcmdsrv_client.c

Patch 6.0.163
Problem:    When using a GUI dialog, a file name is sometimes used like it was
	    a directory.
Solution:   Separate path and file name properly.
	    For GTK, Motif and Athena concatenate directory and file name for
	    the default selection.

	    Insert and Visual mode. (Muraoka Taro)
Solution:   Add <script> to allow script-local mappings.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0.165
Problem:    Using --remote and executing locally gives unavoidable error
	    messages.
Solution:   Add --remote-silent and --remote-wait-silent to silently execute
	    locally.
	    For Win32 there was no error message when a server didn't exist.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/if_xcmdsrv.c, src/main.c, src/os_mswin.c,
	    src/proto/if_xcmdsrv.pro, src/proto/os_mswin.pro

Patch 6.0.166
Problem:    GUI: There is no way to avoid dialogs to pop up.
Solution:   Add the 'c' flag to 'guioptions': Use console dialogs.  (Yegappan
	    Lakshmanan)
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/option.h, src/message.c

Patch 6.0.167
Problem:    When 'fileencodings' is "latin2" some characters in the help files

Patch 6.0.171
Problem:    With 'keymodel' including "startsel", in Insert mode after the end
	    of a line, shift-Left does not move the cursor. (Steve Hall)
Solution:   CTRL-O doesn't move the cursor left, need to do that explicitly.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.0.172
Problem:    CTRL-Q doesn't replace CTRL-V after CTRL-X in Insert mode while it
	    does in most other situations.
Solution:   Make CTRL-X CTRL-Q work like CTRL-X CTRL-V in Insert mode.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.0.173
Problem:    When using "P" to insert a line break the cursor remains past the
	    end of the line.

	    command. (Sylvain Hitier)
Solution:   Redisplay the size of the selection after showing the mode.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.0.190
Problem:    GUI: when 'mouse' is empty a click with the middle button still

Solution:   Paste at the cursor position instead of the mouse position.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.0.191
Problem:    When no servers are available serverlist() gives an error instead
	    of returning an empty string. (Hari Krishna)
Solution:   Don't give an error message.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Solution:   Properly check for the argument.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.0.195
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and a search starts in virtual space
	    ":call search('x')" goes to the wrong position. (Eric Long)
Solution:   Reset coladd when finding a match.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.0.196
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set, 'selection' is "exclusive" and visually
	    selecting part of a tab at the start of a line, "x" joins it with
	    the previous line.  Also, when the selection spans more than one
	    line the whole tab is deleted.
Solution:   Take coladd into account when adjusting for 'selection' being
	    "exclusive".  Also expand a tab into spaces when deleting more
	    than one line.
Files:	    src/normal.c, src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.197
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and 'selection' is "exclusive", "v$x"

Patch 6.0.198
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and 'showbreak' is not empty, moving the
	    cursor over the line break doesn't work properly. (Eric Long)

Files:	    src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.0.206
Problem:    Unix: if expanding a wildcard in a file name results in a
	    wildcard character and there are more parts in the path with a
	    wildcard, it is expanded again.
	    Windows: ":edit \[abc]" could never edit the file "[abc]".
Solution:   Don't expand wildcards in already expanded parts.
	    Don't remove backslashes used to escape the special meaning of a
	    wildcard; can edit "[abc]" if '[' is removed from 'isfname'.

Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.0.209
Problem:    GUI GTK: After selecting a 'guifont' with the font dialog there
	    are redraw problems for multi-byte characters.
Solution:   Separate the font dialog from setting the new font name to avoid
	    that "*" is used to find wide and bold fonts.
	    When redrawing extra characters for the bold trick, take care of
	    UTF-8 characters.

Solution:   Go to end of the fold before counting context lines.
Files:	    src/move.c

Problem:    Win32: When a directory on an NTFS partition is read/execute (no
	    delete,modify,write) and the file has modify rights, trying to
	    write the file deletes it.  Making the file read/write/execute
	    (not delete) solves it. (Mark Canup)
Solution:   Use the Unix code to check for a writable directory.  If not, then
	    make a backup copy and overwrite the file.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.1b.030 (extra)

Patch 6.1b.033
Problem:    When using a count after a ":s" command may get ml_get errors.
	    (Dietmar Lang)

	    buffer.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.1b.034

==============================================================================
VERSION 6.2						*version-6.2*

This section is about improvements made between version 6.1 and 6.2.

This is mainly a bug-fix release.  There are also a few new features.

Main new features:
- Support for GTK 2. (Daniel Elstner)
- Support for editing Arabic text. (Nadim Shaikli & Isam Bayazidi)
- ":try" command and exception handling. (Servatius Brandt)
- Support for the neXtaw GUI toolkit (mostly like Athena). (Alexey Froloff)
- Cscope support for Win32. (Khorev Sergey)
- Support for PostScript printing in various 8-bit encodings. (Mike Williams)


Changed							*changed-6.2*
-------

Removed the scheme indent file, the internal Lisp indenting works well now.

Moved the GvimEXt, OleVim and VisVim directories into the "src" directory.
This is more consistent with how xxd is handled.

The VisVim.dll file is installed in the top directory, next to gvimext.dll,
instead of in a subdirectory "VisVim".  Fixes that NSIS was uninstalling it
from the wrong directory.

Removed the art indent file, it didn't do anything.

submatch() returned line breaks with CR instead of LF.

Changed the Win32 Makefiles to become more uniform and compile gvimext.dll.
(Dan Sharp)

'cindent': Align a "//" comment with a "//" comment in a previous line.
(Helmut Stiegler)

Previously only for xterm-like terminals parent widgets were followed to find
the title and icon label.  Now do this for all terminal emulators.

Made it possible to recognize backslashes for "%" matching.  The 'M' flag in
'cpoptions' disables it. (Haakon Riiser)

Removed the Make_tcc.mak makefile for Turbo C.  It didn't work and we probably
can't make it work (the compiler runs out of memory).

Even though the documentation refers to keywords, "[ CTRL-D" was using
'isident' to find matches.  Changed it to use 'iskeyword'.  Also applies to
other commands that search for defined words in included files such as
":dsearch", "[D" and "[d".

Made 'keywordprg' global-local. (Christian Robinson)

Enabled the Netbeans interface by default.  Reversed the configure argument
from "--enable-netbeans" to "--disable-netbeans".

to all error messages, so that they can be caught by the number.
(Servatius Brandt)
Moved part of ex_docmd.c to the new ex_eval.c source file.

Include support for GTK+ 2.2.x (Daniel Elstner)
Adds the "~" register: drag & drop text.
Adds the 'toolbariconsize' option.

Mac OSX: multi-language support: iconv and gettext. (Muraoka Taro, Axel
Kielhorn)

"\Z" flag in patterns: ignore differences in combining characters. (Ron Aaron)

Added 'preserveindent' and 'copyindent' options.  They use existing white
space characters instead of using Tabs as much as possible. (Chris Leishman)

Updated Unicode tables to Unicode 4.0. (Raphael Finkel)

Support for the mouse wheel in rxvt. (AIDA Shinra)

Win32: Added ":8" file modifier to get short filename.  Test50 tests the ":8"

The Vim icons in PNG format didn't have a transparent background. (Greg
Roelofs)

Fixed a large number of spelling mistakes in the docs. (Adri Verhoef)

The #defines for prototype generation were causing trouble.  Changed them to
typedefs.

A new version of libintl.h uses __asm__, which confuses cproto.  Define a
dummy __asm__ macro.

When 'virtualedit' is set can't move to halfway an unprintable character.
Cripples CTRL-V selection. (Taro Muraoka)
Allow moving to halfway an unprintable character.  Don't let getvvcol() change
the pos->coladd argument.

non-zero, only one character of the foldcolumn is highlighted. (Muraoka Taro)

When using ":catch" without an argument Vim crashes. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
When no argument given use the ".*" pattern.

Win32: When gvim.exe is started from a shortcut with the window style property
set to maximize Vim doesn't start with a maximized window. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)  Open the window with the default size and don't call ShowWindow()
again when it's already visible. (Helmut Stiegler)

gui_gtk.c used MAX, but it's undefined to avoid a conflict with system header
files.

Win32: When closing a window from a mapping some pixels remain on the
statusline. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

A column number in an errorformat that goes beyond the end of the line may
cause a crash.

":throw 'test'" crashes Vim. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

The file selector's scrollbar colors are not set after doing a ":hi Scrollbar
guifg=color".  And the file selector's colors are not changed by the
colorscheme command.  (David Harrison)

Motif: When compiling with FEAT_FOOTER defined, the text area gets a few
pixels extra space on the right.  Remove the special case in
gui_get_base_width(). (David Harrison)

Using CTRL-R CTRL-P in Insert mode puts the '] mark in the wrong position.

Using a "--cmd" argument more than 10 times caused a crash.

DEC style mouse support didn't work if the page field is not empty.
(Uribarri)

"vim -l one two" did only set 'lisp' in the first file.  Vi does it for every
file.

":set tw<" didn't work.  Was checking for '^' instead of '<'.

In ":hardcopy > %.ps" the "%" was not expanded to the current filename.

Made ":redraw" also update the Visual area.

When a not implemented command, such as ":perl", has wrong arguments the less
important error was reported, giving the user the idea the command could work.

On non-Unix systems autocommands for writing did not attempt a match with the
short file name, causing a pattern like "a/b" to fail.

flags. (Vince Negri)

When searching for tags with case ignored Vim could hang.

When searching directories with a stopdir could get a crash.  Did not
re-allocate enough memory. (Vince Negri)

A user command may cause a crash.  Don't use the command index when it's
negative. (Vince Negri)

putenv() didn't work for MingW and Cygwin. (Dan Sharp)

Many functions were common between os_msdos.c and os_win16.c.  Use os_msdos.c
for compiling the Win16 version and remove the functions from os_win16.c.

colors.

Crash when using ":catch" without an argument.  (Servatius Brandt)

Win32: ":n #" doubled the backslashes.

Fixed Arabic shaping for the command line. (Nadim Shaikli)

Avoid splitting up a string displayed on the command line into individual
characters, it breaks Arabic shaping.

Updated Cygwin and MingW makefiles to use more dependencies. (Dan Sharp)

2html.vim didn't work with 'nomagic' set.

When a local argument list is used and doing ":only" Vim could crash later.
(Muraoka Taro)

Sandrini)

Motif and Athena: moving Vim to the foreground didn't uniconify it.  Use
XMapRaised() instead of XRaiseWindow(). (Srikanth Sankaran)

When using ":ptag" in a window where 'scrollbind' is set the preview window
would also have 'scrollbind' set.  Also reset 'foldcolumn' and 'diff'.

Various commands that split a window took over 'scrollbind', which is hardly
ever desired.  Esp. for "q:" and ":copen".  Mostly reset 'scrollbind' when
splitting a window.

When 'shellslash' is set in the vimrc file the first entry of ":scriptnames"
would still have backslashes.  Entries in the quickfix list could also have
wrong (back)slashes.

Win32: printer dialog texts were not translated. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

When using a multi-byte character with a K_SPECIAL byte or a special key code

Win32: The cursor position was incorrect after changing cursor shape.
(Yasuhiro Matsumoto).

Win32: When 'encoding' is not the current codepage the title could not be set
to non-ascii characters.

"vim -d scp://machine/file1 scp://machine/file2" did not work, there was only
one window.  Fixed the netrw plugin not to wipe out the buffer if it is
displayed in other windows.

"/$" caused "e" in last column of screen to disappear, a highlighted blank was
displayed instead.

":s/ *\ze\n//e" removed the line break and introduced arbitrary text.  Was
using the line count including what matched after the "\ze".

Using the "c" flag with ":s" changed the behavior when a line break is
replaced and "\@<=" is used.  Without "c" a following match was not found.

":%s/\vA@<=\nB@=//gce" got stuck on "A\nB" when entering "n".

VMS: add HAVE_STRFTIME in the config file. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

When a delete prompts if a delete should continue when yanking is not
possible, restore msg_silent afterwards.

":sign" did not complain about a missing argument.

library version of fgets() to work correctly for Metrowerks 2.2. (Axel
Kielhorn)

When typing a password a "*" was shown for each byte instead of for each
character.  Added multi-byte handling to displaying the stars. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

When using Perl 5.6 accessing $curbuf doesn't work.  Add an #ifdef to use
different code for 5.6 and 5.8.  (Dan Sharp)

MingW and Cygwin: Don't strip the debug executable. (Dan Sharp)

An assignment to a variable with curlies that includes "==" doesn't work.
Skip over the curlies before searching for an "=". (Vince Negri)

Patch 6.1.102
Problem:    Unprintable and multi-byte characters in a statusline item are not

	    corrupted.  May cause a crash. (Dave Fishburn)

	    illegal bytes gives "CONVERSION ERROR" even though no conversion
	    is done.  'readonly' is set, even though writing the file results
	    in an unmodified file.
Solution:   For this specific error use "ILLEGAL BYTE" and don't set
	    'readonly'.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

	    src/testdir/Make_vms.mms

Patch 6.1.191
Problem:    When using "vim -s script" and redirecting the output, the delay

	    e.g., "$-1join", reloading a file that was changed outside Vim
	    does not work properly. (Alan G Isaac)

	    All systems: 'iminsert' is set to 2 when leaving Insert mode, even
	    when langmap is being used. (Peter Valach)
Solution:   Don't set "b_p_iminsert" in _OnImeNotify(). (Muraoka Taro)

Patch 6.1.225
Problem:    Using <C-O><C-^> in Insert mode has a delay when starting "vim -u
	    NONE" and ":set nocp hidden". (Emmanuel)  do_ecmd() uses
	    fileinfo(), the redraw is done after a delay to give the user time
	    to read the message.
Solution:   Put the message from fileio() in "keep_msg", so that the redraw is
	    done before the delay (still needed to avoid the mode message
	    overwrites the fileinfo() message).
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.1.226

Solution:   Remove HanExtTextOut().  Delete the dead code around
	    bInComposition and ImeGetTempComposition().
Files:	    src/gui_w16.c, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.1.229
Problem:    Win32: Conversion to/from often used codepages requires the iconv

==============================================================================
VERSION 6.3						*version-6.3*

This section is about improvements made between version 6.2 and 6.3.

This is mainly a bug-fix release.  There are also a few new features.
The major number of new items is in the runtime files and translations.


Changed							*changed-6.3*
-------

The intro message also displays a note about sponsoring Vim, mixed randomly
with the message about helping children in Uganda.

Included the translated menus, keymaps and tutors with the normal runtime
files.  The separate "lang" archive now only contains translated messages.

Made the translated menu file names a bit more consistent.  Use "latin1" for
"iso_8859-1" and "iso_8859-15".

Removed the "file_select.vim" script from the distribution.  It's not more
useful than other scripts that can be downloaded from www.vim.org.

The "runtime/doc/tags" file is now always in unix fileformat.  On MS-Windows
it used to be dos fileformat, but ":helptags" generates a unix format file.


Added							*added-6.3*

	:cNfile		go to last error in previous file
	:cpfile		idem

	    When the system is slow, unpacking the resource file takes too
	    long.
Solution:   Don't always define FEAT_GUI_MAC when MACOS is defined, define it
	    in the Makefile.
	    Add a configure option to skip Darwin detection.
	    Use a Python script to unpack the resources to avoid a race
	    condition. (Taro Muraoka)

Patch 6.2.149
Problem:    When the cursor is on a line past 21,474,748 the indicated
	    percentage of the position is invalid.  With that many lines
	    "100%" causes a negative cursor line number, resulting in a crash.
	    (Daniel Goujot)

	    that Insert mode isn't started too early.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.152
Problem:    The cursor() function doesn't reset the column offset for
	    'virtualedit'.
Solution:   Reset the offset to zero. (Helmut Stiegler)
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.153
Problem:    Win32: ":lang german" doesn't use German messages.

	    Koutsoloukas)
Files:	    src/quickfix.c

Patch 6.2.158

Patch 6.2.159
Problem:    When using expression folding and 'foldopen' is "undo" an undo
	    command doesn't always open the fold.
Solution:   Save and restore the KeyTyped variable when evaluating 'foldexpr'.
	    (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fold.c

Patch 6.2.160
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is "all" and 'selection' is "exclusive",
	    selecting a double-width character below a single-width character
	    may cause a crash.
Solution:   Avoid overflow on unsigned integer decrement. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.161 (extra)
Problem:    VMS: Missing header file.  Reading input busy loops.

Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.164 (after 6.2.144)
Problem:    When "g:html_use_css" is set the HTML header generated by the
	    2html script is still wrong.
Solution:   Search for a string instead of jumping to a fixed line number.
	    Go to the start of the line before inserting the header.
	    (Jess Thrysoee)
Files:	    runtime/syntax/2html.vim

Patch 6.2.165
Problem:    The configure checks hang when using autoconf 2.57.
Solution:   Invoke AC_PROGRAM_EGREP to set $EGREP. (Aron Griffis)
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in

Patch 6.2.166
Problem:    When $GZIP contains "-N" editing compressed files doesn't work

Patch 6.2.170
Problem:    When using Sun WorkShop the current directory isn't changed to
	    where the file is.
Solution:   Set the 'autochdir' option when using WorkShop.  And avoid using
	    the basename when 'autochdir' is not set.
Files:	    src/gui_x11.c, src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.171 (after 6.2.163)
Problem:    The "-or" argument of "find" doesn't work for SysV systems.
Solution:   Use "-o" instead. (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.172 (after 6.2.169)

Patch 6.2.185
Problem:    Restoring a session with zero-height windows does not work
	    properly. (Charles Campbell)
Solution:   Accept a zero argument to ":resize" as intended.  Add a window
	    number argument to ":resize" to be able to set the size of other

Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.190
Problem:    When editing a compressed files, marks are lost.
Solution:   Add the ":lockmarks" modifier and use it in the gzip plugin.
	    Make exists() also check for command modifiers, so that the
	    existence of ":lockmarks" can be checked for.
	    Also add ":keepmarks" to avoid that marks are deleted when
	    filtering text.
	    When deleting lines put marks 'A - 'Z and '0 - '9 at the first
	    deleted line instead of clearing the mark.  They were kept in the
	    viminfo file anyway.
	    Avoid that the gzip plugin puts deleted text in registers.

Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.193
Problem:    When recalling a search pattern from the history from a ":s,a/c,"
	    command the '/' ends the search string. (JC van Winkel)
Solution:   Store the separator character with the history entries.  Escape
	    characters when needed, replace the old separator with the new one.
	    Also fixes that recalling a "/" search for a "?" command messes up
	    trailing flags.

	    "buttonRelease" event to the netbeans protocol.  Updated the
	    interface to version 2.2.  (Gordon Prieur)
	    Also: open a fold when the cursor has been positioned.
	    Also: fix memory leak, free result of nb_quote().

Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.199 (after 6.2.194)
Problem:    Vim doesn't work perfectly well with NetBeans.
Solution:   When NetBeans saves the file, reset the timestamp to avoid "file
	    changed" warnings.  Close a buffer in a proper way.  Don't try
	    giving a debug message with an invalid pointer.  Send a
	    newDotAndMark message when needed.  Report a change by the "r"
	    command to NetBeans.  (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    src/netbeans.c, src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.200
Problem:    When recovering a file, 'fileformat' is always the default, thus
	    writing the file may result in differences. (Penelope Fudd)
Solution:   Before recovering the file try reading the original file to obtain
	    the values of 'fileformat', 'fileencoding', etc.
Files:	    src/memline.c

Patch 6.2.201
Problem:    When 'autowriteall' is set ":qall" still refuses to exit if there
	    is a modified buffer. (Antoine Mechelynck)
Solution:   Attempt writing modified buffers as intended.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.2.202
Problem:    Filetype names of CHILL and ch script are confusing.
Solution:   Rename "ch" to "chill" and "chscript" to "ch".
Files:	    runtime/filetype.vim, runtime/makemenu.vim, runtime/synmenu.vim
	    runtime/syntax/ch.vim, runtime/syntax/chill.vim

Patch 6.2.203
Problem:    With characterwise text that has more than one line, "3P" works
	    wrong.  "3p" has the same problem.  There also is a display
	    problem. (Daniel Goujot)
Solution:   Perform characterwise puts with a count in the right position.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.204 (after 6.2.086)
Problem:    "]]" in a file with closed folds moves to the end of the file.
	    (Nam SungHyun)

Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.2.205 (extra)
Problem:    MS-Windows: When the taskbar is at the left or top of the screen,
	    the Vim window placement is wrong.
Solution:   Compute the size and position of the window correctly. (Taro
	    Muraoka)
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.2.206
Problem:    Multi-byte characters cannot be used as hotkeys in a console
	    dialog.  (Mattias Erkisson)
Solution:   Handle multi-byte characters properly.  Also put () or [] around
	    default hotkeys.
Files:	    src/message.c, src/macros.h

Patch 6.2.207
Problem:    When 'encoding' is a multi-byte encoding, expanding an
	    abbreviation that starts where insertion started results in
	    characters before the insertion to be deleted.  (Xiangjiang Ma)
Solution:   Stop searching leftwards for the start of the word at the position
	    where insertion started.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.208
Problem:    When using fold markers, three lines in a row have the start
	    marker and deleting the first one with "dd", a nested fold is not
	    deleted.  (Kamil Burzynski)
	    Using marker folding, a level 1 fold doesn't stop when it is
	    followed by "{{{2", starting a level 2 fold.
Solution:   Don't stop updating folds at the end of a change when the nesting
	    level of folds is larger than the fold level.
	    Correctly compute the number of folds that start at "{{{2".
	    Also avoid a crash for a NULL pointer.
Files:	    src/fold.c

Patch 6.2.209
Problem:    A bogus fold is created when using "P" while the cursor is in the
	    middle of a closed fold. (Kamil Burzynski)
Solution:   Correct the line number where marks are modified for closed folds.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.210 (extra)
Problem:    Mac OSX: antialiased fonts are not supported.
Solution:   Add the 'antialias' option to switch on antialiasing on Mac OSX
	    10.2 and later. (Peter Cucka)
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/gui_mac.c, src/option.h, src/option.c

Patch 6.2.211 (extra)
Problem:    Code for handling file dropped on Vim is duplicated.
Solution:   Move the common code to gui_handle_drop().
	    Add code to drop the files in the window under the cursor.
	    Support drag&drop on the Macintosh.  (Taro Muraoka)
	    When dropping a directory name edit that directory (using the
	    explorer plugin)
	    Fix that changing directory with Shift pressed didn't work for
	    relative path names.

	    at fold level 1. (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Correctly compute the number of folds that start at "{{{1".
Files:	    src/fold.c

Patch 6.2.214 (after 6.2.211) (extra)

Solution:   Delete the declaration. (Bill McCarthy)
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.2.215
Problem:    NetBeans: problems saving an unmodified file.
Solution:   Add isNetbeansModified() function.  Disable netbeans_unmodified().
	    (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/netbeans.c, src/proto/netbeans.pro,
	    runtime/doc/netbeans.txt, runtime/doc/tags

Problem:    Warning for function without prototype.
Solution:   Add argument types to the msgCB field of the BalloonEval struct.
Files:	    src/gui_beval.h

Patch 6.2.219
Problem:    Syntax highlighting hangs on an empty match of an item with a
	    nextgroup.  (Charles Campbell)
Solution:   Remember that the item has already matched and don't match it
	    again at the same position.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.220
Problem:    When a Vim server runs in a console a remote command isn't handled
	    before a key is typed.  (Joshua Neuheisel)
Solution:   Don't try reading more input when a client-server command has been
	    received.
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.221
Problem:    No file name completion for ":cscope add".
Solution:   Add the XFILE flag to ":cscope". (Gary Johnson)
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.h

Patch 6.2.222
Problem:    Using "--remote" several times on a row only opens some of the
	    files. (Dany St-Amant)
Solution:   Don't delete all typeahead when the server receives a command from
	    a client, only delete typed characters.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.223
Problem:    Cscope: Avoid a hang when cscope waits for a response while Vim
	    waits for a prompt.
	    Error messages from Cscope mess up the display.
Solution:   Detect the hit-enter message and respond by sending a return
	    character to cscope. (Gary Johnson)
	    Use EMSG() and strerror() when possible.  Replace perror() with
	    PERROR() everywhere, add emsg3().
Files:	    src/diff.c, src/if_cscope.c, src/integration.c, src/message.c,
	    src/proto/message.pro, src/misc2.c, src/netbeans.c, src/vim.h

Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.225
Problem:    NetBeans: Reported modified state isn't exactly right.
Solution:   Report a file being modified in the NetBeans way.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.226 (after 6.2.107) (extra)
Problem:    The "ws2-32.lib" file isn't always available.
Solution:   Use "WSock32.lib" instead. (Taro Muraoka, Dan Sharp)
Files:	    src/Make_cyg.mak, src/Make_ming.mak, src/Make_mvc.mak

Patch 6.2.227 (extra)
Problem:    The "PC" symbol is defined but not used anywhere.
Solution:   Remove "-DPC" from the makefiles.
Files:	    src/Make_bc3.mak, src/Make_bc5.mak, src/Make_cyg.mak,
	    src/Make_ming.mak

Patch 6.2.228
Problem:    Receiving CTRL-\ CTRL-N after typing "f" or "m" doesn't switch Vim
	    back to Normal mode.  Same for CTRL-\ CTRL-G.
Solution:   Check if the character typed after a command is CTRL-\ and obtain
	    another character to check for CTRL-N or CTRL-G, waiting up to
	    'ttimeoutlen' msec.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.229
Problem:    ":function" with a name that uses magic curlies does not work
	    inside a function.  (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Skip over the function name properly.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.230 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: a complex pattern may cause a crash.
Solution:   Use __try and __except to catch the exception and handle it
	    gracefully, when possible.  Add myresetstkoflw() to reset the
	    stack overflow. (Benjamin Peterson)
Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak, src/os_mswin.c src/os_win32.c, src/os_win32.h,
	    src/proto/os_win32.pro, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.231 (after 6.2.046)
Problem:    Various problems when an error exception is raised from within a
	    builtin function.  When it is invoked while evaluating arguments
	    to a function following arguments are still evaluated.  When
	    invoked with a line range it will be called for remaining lines.
Solution:   Update "force_abort" also after calling a builtin function, so
	    that aborting() always returns the correct value. (Servatius
	    Brandt)
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/ex_eval.c, src/proto/ex_eval.pro,
	    src/testdir/test49.ok, src/testdir/test49.vim

Patch 6.2.232
Problem:    ":python vim.command('python print 2*2')" crashes Vim.  (Eugene
	    Minkovskii)
Solution:   Disallow executing a Python command recursively and give an error
	    message.
Files:	    src/if_python.c

Patch 6.2.233
Problem:    On Mac OSX adding -pthread for Python only generates a warning.
	    The test for Perl threads rejects Perl while it's OK.
	    Tcl doesn't work at all.
	    The test for Ruby fails if ruby exists but there are no header
	    files.  The Ruby library isn't detected properly
Solution:   Avoid adding -pthread on Mac OSX.  Accept Perl threads when it's
	    not the 5.5 threads.
	    Use the Tcl framework for header files.  For Ruby rename cWindow
	    to cVimWindow to avoid a name clash. (Ken Scott)
	    Only enable Ruby when the header files can be found.  Use "-lruby"
	    instead of "libruby.a" when it can't be found.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/if_ruby.c

Patch 6.2.234
Problem:    GTK 2 GUI: ":sp" and the ":q" leaves the cursor on the command
	    line.
Solution:   Flush output before removing scrollbars.  Also do this in other
	    places where gui_mch_*() functions are invoked.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/option.c, src/window.c

Patch 6.2.235 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Cursor isn't removed with a 25x80 window and doing:
	    "1830ia<Esc>400a-<Esc>0w0". (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Solution:   Remove the call to gui_undraw_cursor() from gui_mch_insert_lines().
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.2.236
Problem:    Using gvim with Agide gives "connection lost" error messages.
Solution:   Only give the "connection lost" message when the buffer was once
	    owned by NetBeans.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c, src/structs.h

Patch 6.2.237
Problem:    GTK 2: Thai text is drawn wrong.  It changes when moving the
	    cursor over it.
Solution:   Disable the shaping engine, it moves combining characters to a
	    wrong position and combines characters, while drawing the cursor
	    doesn't combine characters.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.238 (after 6.2.231)
Problem:    ":function" does not work inside a while loop. (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Add get_while_line() and pass it to do_one_cmd() when in a while
	    loop, so that all lines are stored and can be used again when
	    repeating the loop.
	    Adjust test 49 so that it checks for the fixed problems.
	    (Servatius Brandt)
Files:	    src/digraph.c, src/ex_cmds2.c, src/ex_docmd.c, src/ex_eval.c,

	    mouse pointer position.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c, src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.240
Problem:    GTK 2: Searching for bitmaps for the toolbar doesn't work as with
	    other systems.  Need to explicitly use "icon=name".  (Ned Konz,
	    Christian J.  Robinson)
Solution:   Search for icons like done for Motif.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.241
Problem:    GTK 2: Search and Search/Replace dialogs are synced, that makes no
	    sense.  Buttons are sometimes greyed-out. (Jeremy Messenger)
Solution:   Remove the code to sync the two dialogs.  Adjust the code to react
	    to an empty search string to also work for GTK2. (David Necas)
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.242
Problem:    Gnome: "vim --help" only shows the Gnome arguments, not the Vim
	    arguments.
Solution:   Don't let the Gnome code remove the "--help" argument and don't
	    exit at the end of usage().
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/main.c

Patch 6.2.243 (extra)
Problem:    Mac: Dropping a file on a Vim icon causes a hit-enter prompt.
Solution:   Move the dropped files to the global argument list, instead of the
	    usual drop handling. (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/main.c, src/gui_mac.c

Patch 6.2.244
Problem:    ':echo "\xf7"' displays the illegal byte as if it was a character
	    and leaves "cho" after it.
Solution:   When checking the length of a UTF-8 byte sequence and it's shorter
	    than the number of bytes available, assume it's an illegal byte.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.245
Problem:    Completion doesn't work for ":keepmarks" and ":lockmarks".
Solution:   Add the command modifiers to the table of commands. (Madoka
	    Machitani)
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.h, src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.246
Problem:    Mac: Starting Vim from Finder doesn't show error messages.

	    "/dev/console".  (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/main.c, src/message.c

Patch 6.2.247 (after 6.2.193)
Problem:    When using a search pattern from the viminfo file the last
	    character is replaced with a '/'.
Solution:   Store the separator character in the right place. (Kelvin Lee)
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.2.248
Problem:    GTK: When XIM is enabled normal "2" and keypad "2" cannot be
	    distinguished.
Solution:   Detect that XIM changes the keypad key to the expected ASCII
	    character and fall back to the non-XIM code. (Neil Bird)

Solution:   Delete the list of signs when unloading a buffer.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.2.251
Problem:    GTK: The 'v' flag in 'guioptions' doesn't work. (Steve Hall)
	    Order of buttons is reversed for GTK 2.2.4.  Don't always get
	    focus back after handling a dialog.
Solution:   Make buttons appear vertically when desired.  Reverse the order in
	    which buttons are added to a dialog.  Move mouse pointer around
	    when the dialog is done and we don't have focus.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.252 (extra, after 6.2.243)
Problem:    Mac: Dropping a file on a Vim icon causes a hit-enter prompt for
	    Mac OS classic.
Solution:   Remove the #ifdef from the code that fixes it for Mac OSX.
Files:	    src/gui_mac.c

Patch 6.2.253
Problem:    When 'tagstack' is not set a ":tag id" command does not work after

Solution:   Don't increment the menu item index.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.256
Problem:    Mac: "macroman" encoding isn't recognized, need to use
	    "8bit-macroman".
Solution:   Recognize "macroman" with an alias "mac". (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.257 (after 6.2.250)
Problem:    Signs are deleted for ":bdel", but they could still be useful.
Solution:   Delete signs only for ":bwipe".
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.2.258
Problem:    GUI: can't disable (grey-out) a popup menu item.  (Ajit Thakkar)
Solution:   Loop over the popup menus for all modes.
Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 6.2.259
Problem:    If there are messages when exiting, on the console there is a
	    hit-enter prompt while the message can be read; in the GUI the
	    message may not be visible.
Solution:   Use the hit-enter prompt when there is an error message from
	    writing the viminfo file or autocommands, or when there is any
	    output in the GUI and 'verbose' is set.  Don't use a hit-enter
	    prompt for the non-GUI version unless there is an error message.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.260
Problem:    GTK 2: Can't quit a dialog with <Esc>.
	    GTK 1 and 2: <Enter> always gives a result, even when the default
	    button has been disabled.
Solution:   Handle these keys explicitly.  When no default button is specified
	    use the first one (works mostly like it was before).
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.261
Problem:    When 'autoindent' and 'cindent' are set and a line is recognized
	    as a comment, starting a new line won't do 'cindent' formatting.
Solution:   Also use 'cindent' formatting for lines that are used as a
	    comment. (Servatius Brandt)
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2.262
Problem:    1 CTRL-W w beeps, even though going to the first window is
	    possible. (Charles Campbell)

Patch 6.2.263
Problem:    Lint warnings: Duplicate function prototypes, duplicate macros,
	    use of a zero character instead of a zero pointer, unused
	    variable.  Clearing allocated memory in a complicated way.
Solution:   Remove the function prototypes from farsi.h.  Remove the
	    duplicated lines in keymap.h.  Change getvcol() argument from NUL
	    to NULL.  Remove the "col" variable in regmatch().  Use
	    lalloc_clear() instead of lalloc(). (Walter Briscoe)

	    can't be changed from a modeline.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.h, src/options.c

Patch 6.2.266
Problem:    When redirecting output and using ":silent", line breaks are
	    missing from output of ":map" and ":tselect".  Alignment of
	    columns is wrong.
Solution:   Insert a line break where "msg_didout" was tested.  Update msg_col
	    when redirecting and using ":silent".
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/message.c

Patch 6.2.267 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: "&&" in a tearoff menu is not shown. (Luc Hermitte)

Patch 6.2.269
Problem:    Diff mode does not highlight a change in a combining character.
	    (Raphael Finkel)

	    a character that contains a change.
Files:	    src/diff.c

Patch 6.2.270
Problem:    Completion in Insert mode, then repeating with ".", doesn't handle
	    composing characters in the completed text. (Raphael Finkel)
Solution:   Don't skip over composing chars when adding completed text to the
	    redo buffer.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.271
Problem:    NetBeans: Can't do "tail -f" on the log.  Passing socket info with
	    an argument or environment variable is not secure.
Solution:   Wait after initializing the log.  Allow passing the socket info
	    through a file. (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    runtime/doc/netbeans.txt, src/main.c, src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.272
Problem:    When the "po" directory exists, but "po/Makefile" doesn't,
	    building fails.  Make loops when the "po" directory has been
	    deleted after running configure.
Solution:   Check for the "po/Makefile" instead of just the "po" directory.
	    Check this again before trying to run make with that Makefile.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/Makefile

Solution:   Convert the text to 'encoding'.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.284
Problem:    Listing a function puts "endfunction" in the message history.
	    Typing "q" at the more prompt isn't handled correctly when listing
	    variables and functions.  (Hara Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Don't use msg() for "endfunction".  Check "got_int" regularly.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Solution:   Restore "restart_edit" after an insert command that was not typed.
	    Avoid waiting with displaying the mode when there is no text to be

	    properly.
Solution:   Only make a new entry in the changelist when making a change in
	    another line or 'textwidth' columns away.  Add E662, E663 and E664
	    error messages.  Put a changelist mark from viminfo one position
	    before the end.

Solution:   Handle the pointer move event for the tear-off menu window.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 6.2.355 (after 6.2.303)
Problem:    When 'encoding' is a double-byte encoding different from the
	    current locale, the width of characters is not correct.
	    Possible failure and memory leak when using iconv, Unicode
	    digraphs and 'encoding' is not "utf-8".
Solution:   Use iconv() to discover the actual width of characters.
	    Add the "vc_fail" field to vimconv_T.
	    When converting a digraph, init the conversion type to NONE and
	    cleanup afterwards.
Files:	    src/digraph.c, src/mbyte.c, src/structs.h

Patch 6.2.356
Problem:    When using a double-byte 'encoding' and 'selection' is
	    "exclusive", "vy" only yanks the first byte of a double-byte
	    character.  (Xiangjiang Ma)
Solution:   Correct the column in unadjust_for_sel() to position on the first
	    byte, always include the trailing byte of the selected text.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.357 (after 6.2.321)
Problem:    Memory leak when resizing the Vim window.
Solution:   Free the LineWraps array.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.358 (after 6.2.299)

Patch 6.2.360
Problem:    "100|" in an empty line results in a ruler "1,0-100". (Pavol
	    Juhas)
Solution:   Recompute w_virtcol if the target column was not reached.
Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.361 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Run gvim, ":set go-=m", use Alt-Tab, keep Alt pressed while
	    pressing Esc, then release Alt: Cursor disappears and typing a key
	    causes a beep. (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Don't ignore the WM_SYSKEYUP event when the menu is disabled.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 6.2.362 (extra, after 6.2.347)
Problem:    Win32: The manifest causes Gvim not to work. (Dave Roberts)
Solution:   Change "x86" to "X86". (Serge Pirotte)
Files:	    src/gvim.exe.mnf

Patch 6.2.363
Problem:    In an empty file with 'showmode' off, "i" doesn't change the ruler
	    from "0-1" to "1".  Typing "x<BS>" does show "1", but then <Esc>
	    doesn't make it "0-1" again.  Same problem for ruler in
	    statusline.  (Andrew Pimlott)
Solution:   Remember the "empty line" flag with Insert mode and'ed to it.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.364
Problem:    HTML version of the documentation doesn't mention the encoding,
	    which is a problem for mbyte.txt.
Solution:   Adjust the awk script. (Ilya Sher)
Files:	    runtime/doc/makehtml.awk

Patch 6.2.365
Problem:    The configure checks for Perl and Python may add compile and link
	    arguments that break building Vim.
Solution:   Do a sanity check: try building with the arguments.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in

Patch 6.2.366
Problem:    When the GUI can't start because no valid font is found, there is
	    no error message. (Ugen)
Solution:   Add an error message.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.367
Problem:    Building the help tags file while installing may fail if there is
	    another Vim in $PATH.
Solution:   Specify the just installed Vim executable. (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.368
Problem:    When 'autochdir' is set, closing a window doesn't change to the
	    directory of the new current window. (Salman Halim)
Solution:   Handle 'autochdir' always when a window becomes the current one.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 6.2.369
Problem:    Various memory leaks: when using globpath(), when searching for
	    help tags files, when defining a function inside a function, when
	    giving an error message through an exception, for the final "."
	    line in ":append", in expression "cond ? a : b" that fails and for
	    missing ")" in an expression.  Using NULL pointer when adding
	    first user command and for pointer computations with regexp.
	    (tests by Dominique Pelle)
Solution:   Fix the leaks by freeing the allocated memory.  Don't use the
	    array of user commands when there are no entries.  Use a macro
	    instead of a function call for saving and restoring regexp states.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/ex_docmd.c, src/ex_getln.c,
	    src/misc2.c, src/regexp.c, src/screen.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.370 (extra, after6.2.341)
Problem:    Win32: When the path to diff.exe contains a space and using the
	    vimrc generated by the install program, diff mode may not work.
	    (Alejandro Lopez-Valencia)
Solution:   Do not use double quotes for arguments that do not have a space.
Files:	    src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.2.371
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and there is a Tab before the next "x",
	    "dtx" does not delete the whole Tab. (Ken Hashishi)
Solution:   Move the cursor to the last position of the Tab.  Also for
	    "df<Tab>".
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.372
Problem:    When using balloon evaluation, no value is displayed for members
	    of structures and items of an array.
Solution:   Include "->", "." and "[*]" in the expression.
Files:	    src/gui_beval.c, src/normal.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.373
Problem:    When 'winminheight' is zero and a window is reduced to zero
	    height, the ruler always says "Top" instead of the cursor
	    position. (Antoine J. Mechelynck)
Solution:   Don't recompute w_topline for a zero-height window.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 6.2.374
Problem:    ":echo "hello" | silent normal n" removes the "hello" message.
	    (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Don't echo the search string when ":silent" was used.  Also don't
	    show the mode.  In general: don't clear to the end of the screen.
Files:	    src/gui.c, src/message.c, src/os_unix.c, src/proto/message.pro,
	    src/screen.c, src/search.c, src/window.c

Patch 6.2.375
Problem:    When changing 'guioptions' the hit-enter prompt may be below the
	    end of the Vim window.
Solution:   Call screen_alloc() before showing the prompt.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.2.376
Problem:    Win32: Ruby interface cannot be dynamically linked with Ruby 1.6.
Solution:   Add #ifdefs around use of rb_w32_snprintf().  (Benot Cerrina)
Files:	    src/if_ruby.c

Patch 6.2.377 (after 6.2.372)
Problem:    Compiler warnings for signed/unsigned compare. (Michael Wookey)
Solution:   Add type cast.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.378 (extra, after 6.2.118)
Problem:    Mac: cannot build with Project Builder.
Solution:   Add remove_tail_with_ext() to locate and remove the "build"
	    directory from the runtime path.  Include os_unix.c when needed.
	    (Dany St Amant)
Files:	    src/misc1.c, src/os_macosx.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.379
Problem:    Using ":mkvimrc" in the ":options" window sets 'bufhidden' to
	    "delete". (Michael Naumann)
Solution:   Do not add buffer-specific option values to a global vimrc file.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.380 (extra)
Problem:    DOS: "make test" fails when running it again.  Can't "make test"
	    with Borland C.
Solution:   Make sure ".out" files are deleted when they get in the way.  Add
	    a "test" target to the Borland C Makefile.
Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak, src/testdir/Make_dos.mak

Patch 6.2.381
Problem:    Setting 'fileencoding' to a comma separated list (confusing it
	    with 'fileencodings') does not result in an error message.
	    Setting 'fileencoding' in an empty file marks it as modified.
	    There is no "+" in the title after setting 'fileencoding'.
Solution:   Check for a comma in 'fileencoding'.  Only consider a non-empty
	    file modified by changing 'fileencoding'.  Update the title after
	    changing 'fileencoding'.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.382
Problem:    Running "make test" puts marks from test files in viminfo.
Solution:   Specify a different viminfo file to use.
Files:	    src/testdir/test15.in, src/testdir/test49.in

Patch 6.2.383

Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.384
Problem:    ":menu a.&b" ":unmenu a.b" only works if "&b" isn't translated.
Solution:   Also compare the names without '&' characters.
Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 6.2.385  (extra)
Problem:    Win32: forward_slash() and trash_input_buf() are undefined when
	    compiling with small features. (Ajit Thakkar)
Solution:   Change the #ifdefs for forward_slash().  Don't call
	    trash_input_buf() if the input buffer isn't used.
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.386
Problem:    Wasting time trying to read marks from the viminfo file for a
	    buffer without a name.
Solution:   Skip reading marks when the buffer has no name.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.387
Problem:    There is no highlighting of translated items in help files.
Solution:   Search for a "help_ab.vim" syntax file when the help file is
	    called "*.abx".  Also improve the help highlighting a bit.
Files:	    runtime/syntax/help.vim

Patch 6.2.388
Problem:    GTK: When displaying some double-width characters they are drawn
	    as single-width, because of conversion to UTF-8.
Solution:   Check the width that GTK uses and add a space if it's one instead
	    of two.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.389
Problem:    When working over a slow connection, it's very annoying that the
	    last line is partly drawn and then cleared for every change.
Solution:   Don't redraw the bottom line if no rows were inserted or deleted.
	    Don't draw the line if we know "@" lines will be used.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.390
Problem:    Using "r*" in Visual mode on multi-byte characters only replaces
	    every other character. (Tyson Roberts)
Solution:   Correct the cursor position after replacing each character.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.391 (extra)
Problem:    The ":highlight" command is not tested.
Solution:   Add a test script for ":highlight".
Files:	    src/testdir/Makefile, src/testdir/Make_amiga.mak,
	    src/testdir/Make_dos.mak, src/testdir/Make_os2.mak,

Problem:    Unused variable.
Solution:   Remove "dlen".
Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 6.2.393
Problem:    When using very long lines the viminfo file can become very big.
Solution:   Add the "s" flag to 'viminfo': skip registers with more than the
	    specified Kbyte of text.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/ops.c, src/option.c

Patch 6.2.394  (after 6.2.391)
Problem:    Test 51 fails on a terminal with 8 colors. (Tony Leneis)
Solution:   Use "DarkBlue" instead of "Blue" to avoid the "bold" attribute.
Files:	    src/testdir/test51.in

Patch 6.2.395
Problem:    When using ":tag" or ":pop" the previous matching tag is used.
	    But since the current file is different, the ordering of the tags
	    may change.
Solution:   Remember what the current buffer was for when re-using cur_match.
Files:	    src/edit.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/proto/tag.pro, src/structs.h,
	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.396
Problem:    When CTRL-T jumps to another file and an autocommand moves the
	    cursor to the '" mark, don't end up on the right line.  (Michal
	    Malecki)
Solution:   Set the line number after loading the file.
Files:	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.397
Problem:    When using a double-byte 'encoding' mapping <M-x> doesn't work.
	    (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Solution:   Do not set the 8th bit of the character but use a modifier.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/gui_x11.c, src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.398 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 console: no extra key modifiers are supported.
Solution:   Encode the modifiers into the input stream.  Also fix that special
	    keys are converted and stop working when 'tenc' is set.  Also fix
	    that when 'tenc' is initialized the input and output conversion is
	    not setup properly until 'enc' or 'tenc' is set.
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/option.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.399
Problem:    A ":set" command that fails still writes a message when it is

Solution:   Include header file poll.h. (Malte Neumann)
Files:	    src/if_xcmdsrv.c

Patch 6.2.401
Problem:    When opening a buffer that was previously opened, Vim does not
	    restore the cursor position if the first line starts with white
	    space.  (Gregory Margo)
Solution:   Don't skip restoring the cursor position if it is past the blanks
	    in the first line.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.2.402
Problem:    Mac: "make install" doesn't generate help tags. (Benji Fisher)
Solution:   Generate help tags before copying the runtime files.
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.403
Problem:    ":@y" checks stdin if there are more commands to execute.  This
	    fails if stdin is not connected, e.g., when starting the GUI from
	    KDE. (Ned Konz)
Solution:   Only check for a next command if there still is typeahead.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.404
Problem:    Our own function to determine width of Unicode characters may get
	    outdated. (Markus Kuhn)
Solution:   Use wcwidth() when it is available.  Also use iswprint().
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/config.h.in, src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.405
Problem:    Cannot map zero without breaking the count before a command.
	    (Benji Fisher)
Solution:   Disable mapping zero when entering a count.
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/globals.h, src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.406
Problem:    ":help \zs", ":help \@=" and similar don't find useful help.
Solution:   Prepend "/\" to the arguments to find the desired help tag.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.407 (after 6.2.299)
Problem:    ":help \@<=" doesn't find help.
Solution:   Avoid that ":help \@<=" searches for the "<=" language.
Files:	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.408
Problem:    ":compiler" is not consistent: Sets local options and a global
	    variable. (Douglas Potts)  There is no error message when a
	    compiler is not supported.
Solution:   Use ":compiler!" to set a compiler globally, otherwise it's local
	    to the buffer and "b:current_compiler" is used.  Give an error
	    when no compiler script could be found.
	    Note: updated compiler plugins can be found at
	    ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/compiler/
Files:	    runtime/compiler/msvc.vim, runtime/doc/quickfix.txt, src/eval.c,
	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.2.409
Problem:    The cursor ends up in the last column instead of after the line
	    when doing "i//<Esc>o" with 'indentexpr' set to "cindent(v:lnum)".
	    (Toby Allsopp)
Solution:   Adjust the cursor as if in Insert mode.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2.410 (after 6.2.389)
Problem:    In diff mode, when there are more filler lines than fit in the
	    window, they are not drawn.
Solution:   Check for filler lines when skipping to draw a line that doesn't
	    fit.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.411
Problem:    A "\n" inside a string is not seen as a line break by the regular
	    expression matching. (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Add the vim_regexec_nl() function for strings where "\n" is to be
	    matched with a line break.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/ex_eval.c, src/proto/regexp.c, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.412
Problem:    Ruby: "ruby << EOF" inside a function doesn't always work.  Also
	    for ":python", ":tcl" and ":perl".
Solution:   Check for "<< marker" and skip until "marker" before checking for
	    "endfunction".
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.413 (after 6.2.411)
Problem:    Missing prototype for vim_regexec_nl(). (Marcel Svitalsky)
Solution:   Now really include the prototype.
Files:	    src/proto/regexp.pro

Patch 6.2.414
Problem:    The function used for custom completion of user commands cannot
	    have <SID> to make it local. (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Pass the SID of the script where the user command was defined on
	    to the completion.  Also clean up #ifdefs.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/eval.c, src/ex_getln.c, src/structs.h

Patch 6.2.415
Problem:    Vim may crash after a sequence of events that change the window
	    size.  The window layout assumes a larger window than is actually
	    available. (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Invoke win_new_shellsize() from screenalloc() instead of from
	    set_shellsize().
Files:	    src/screen.c, src/term.c

Patch 6.2.416
Problem:    Compiler warning for incompatible pointer.
Solution:   Remove the "&" in the call to poll(). (Xavier de Gaye)
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.417 (after 6.2.393)
Problem:    Many people forget that the '"' item in 'viminfo' needs to be
	    preceded with a backslash,
Solution:   Add '<' as an alias for the '"' item.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/ops.c, src/option.c

Patch 6.2.418
Problem:    Using ":nnoremap <F12> :echo "cheese" and ":cabbr cheese xxx":
	    when pressing <F12> still uses the abbreviation. (Hari Krishna)
Solution:   Also apply "noremap" to abbreviations.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.419 (extra)

	    src/proto/gui_w32.pro

Patch 6.2.420
Problem:    Cannot specify a file to be edited in binary mode without setting
	    the global value of the 'binary' option.
Solution:   Support ":edit ++bin file".

Patch 6.2.421
Problem:    Cannot set the '[ and '] mark, which may be necessary when an
	    autocommand simulates reading a file.
Solution:   Allow using "m[" and "m]".
Files:	    runtime/doc/motion.txt, src/mark.c

Patch 6.2.422
Problem:    In CTRL-X completion messages the "/" makes them less readable.
Solution:   Remove the slashes. (Antony Scriven)
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.423
Problem:    ":vertical wincmd ]" does not split vertically.
Solution:   Add "postponed_split_flags".
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/globals.h, src/if_cscope.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.424
Problem:    A BufEnter autocommand that sets an option stops 'mousefocus' from
	    working in Insert mode (Normal mode is OK). (Gregory Seidman)
Solution:   In the Insert mode loop invoke gui_mouse_correct() when needed.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.425
Problem:    Vertical split and command line window: can only drag status line
	    above the cmdline window on the righthand side, not lefthand side.
Solution:   Check the status line row instead of the window pointer.
Files:	    src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.426
Problem:    A syntax region end match with a matchgroup that includes a line
	    break only highlights the last line with matchgroup. (Gary
	    Holloway)
Solution:   Also use the line number of the position where the region
	    highlighting ends.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.427 (extra)
Problem:    When pasting a lot of text in a multi-byte encoding, conversion
	    from 'termencoding' to 'encoding' may fail for some characters.
	    (Kuang-che Wu)
Solution:   When there is an incomplete byte sequence at the end of the read
	    text keep it for the next time.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c, src/os_amiga.c, src/os_mswin.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro,
	    src/proto/os_mswin.pro, src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.428
Problem:    The X11 clipboard supports the Vim selection for char/line/block
	    mode, but since the encoding is not included  can't copy/paste
	    between two Vims with a different 'encoding'.
Solution:   Add a new selection format that includes the 'encoding'.  Perform
	    conversion when necessary.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/ui.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.429
Problem:    Unix: glob() doesn't work for a directory with a single quote in
	    the name. (Nazri Ramliy)
Solution:   When using the shell to expand, only put double quotes around
	    spaces and single quotes, not the whole thing.
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.430
Problem:    BOM at start of a vim script file is not recognized and causes an
	    error message.
Solution:   Detect the BOM and skip over it.  Also fix that after using
	    ":scriptencoding" the iconv() file descriptor was not closed
	    (memory leak).
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.2.431
Problem:    When using the horizontal scrollbar, the scrolling is limited to
	    the length of the cursor line.
Solution:   Make the scroll limit depend on the longest visible line.  The
	    cursor is moved when necessary.  Including the 'h' flag in
	    'guioptions' disables this.
Files:	    runtime/doc/gui.txt, runtime/doc/options.txt, src/gui.c,
	    src/misc2.c, src/option.h

Patch 6.2.432 (after 6.2.430 and 6.2.431)

	    result. (Alejandro Lopez Valencia)
Solution:   Use a string for each combination.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.434 (after 6.2.431)
Problem:    Compiler warning. (Salman Halim)
Solution:   Add type casts.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.435
Problem:    When there are vertically split windows the minimal Vim window
	    height is computed wrong.
Solution:   Use frame_minheight() to correctly compute the minimal height.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 6.2.436
Problem:    Running the tests changes the user's viminfo file.
Solution:   In test 49 tell the extra Vim to use the test viminfo file.
Files:	    src/testdir/test49.vim

Patch 6.2.437
Problem:    ":mksession" always puts "set nocompatible" in the session file.
	    This changes option settings. (Ron Aaron)
Solution:   Add an "if" to only change 'compatible' when needed.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.438
Problem:    When the 'v' flag is present in 'cpoptions', backspacing and then
	    typing text again: one character too much is overtyped before
	    inserting is done again.
Solution:   Set "dollar_vcol" to the right column.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.439
Problem:    GTK 2: Changing 'lines' may cause a mismatch between the window
	    layout and the size of the window.
Solution:   Disable the hack with force_shell_resize_idle().
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.440
Problem:    When 'lazyredraw' is set the window title is still updated.
	    The size of the Visual area and the ruler are displayed too often.
Solution:   Postpone redrawing the window title.  Only show the Visual area
	    size when waiting for a character.  Don't draw the ruler
	    unnecessary.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/normal.c, src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.441
Problem:    ":unabbreviate foo " doesn't work, because of the trailing space,
	    while an abbreviation with a trailing space is not possible. (Paul
	    Jolly)
Solution:   Accept a match with the lhs of an abbreviation without the
	    trailing space.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.442
Problem:    Cannot manipulate the command line from a function.
Solution:   Add getcmdline(), getcmdpos() and setcmdpos() functions and the
	    CTRL-\ e command.
Files:	    runtime/doc/cmdline.txt, runtime/doc/eval.txt, src/eval.c
	    src/ex_getln.c, src/ops.c, src/proto/ex_getln.pro,
	    src/proto/ops.pro

Patch 6.2.443
Problem:    With ":silent! echoerr something" you don't get the position of
	    the error.  emsg() only writes the message itself and returns.
Solution:   Also redirect the position of the error.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.2.444
Problem:    When adding the 'c' flag to a ":substitute" command it may replace
	    more times than without the 'c' flag.  Happens for a  match that
	    starts with "\ze" (Marcel Svitalsk) and when using "\@<=" (Klaus
	    Bosau).
Solution:   Correct "prev_matchcol" when replacing the line.  Don't replace
	    the line when the pattern uses look-behind matching.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/proto/regexp.pro, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.445
Problem:    Copying vimtutor to /tmp/something is not secure, a symlink may

	    create the directory with mode 700.  (Stefan Nordhausen)
Files:	    src/vimtutor

Patch 6.2.446 (after 6.2.404)
Problem:    Using library functions wcwidth() and iswprint() results in
	    display problems for Hebrew characters. (Ron Aaron)
Solution:   Disable the code to use the library functions, use our own.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.447 (after 6.2.440)
Problem:    Now that the title is only updated when redrawing, it is no longer
	    possible to show it while executing a function. (Madoka Machitani)
Solution:   Make ":redraw" also update the title.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

	    option values for 'include' and 'defined'. (RG Kiran)
Solution:   Adjust the default values to allow white space before the #.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/option.c

Patch 6.2.451
Problem:    GTK: when using XIM there are various problems, including setting
	    'modified' and breaking undo at the wrong moment.
Solution:   Add "xim_changed_while_preediting", "preedit_end_col" and
	    im_is_preediting(). (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/globals.h, src/gui_gtk.c, src/gui_gtk_x11.c,
	    src/mbyte.c, src/misc1.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro, src/screen.c,
	    src/undo.c

Patch 6.2.452
Problem:    In diff mode, when DiffAdd and DiffText highlight settings are
	    equal, an added line is highlighted with DiffChange. (Tom Schumm)
Solution:   Remember the diff highlight type instead of the attributes.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.453
Problem:    ":s/foo\|\nbar/x/g" does not replace two times in "foo\nbar".
	    (Pavel Papushev)
Solution:   When the pattern can match a line break also try matching at the
	    NUL at the end of a line.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.454
Problem:    ":let b:changedtick" doesn't work. (Alan Schmitt)  ":let
	    b:changedtick = 99" does not give an error message.

Patch 6.2.456 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Editing a file by its Unicode name (dropping it on Vim or
	    using the file selection dialog) doesn't work. (Yakov Lerner, Alex
	    Jakushev)
Solution:   Use wide character functions when file names are involved and
	    convert from/to 'encoding' where needed.
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c, src/macros.h, src/memfile.c, src/memline.c,
	    src/os_mswin.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.457 (after 6.2.244)
Problem:    When 'encoding' is "utf-8" and writing text with chars above 0x80
	    in latin1, conversion is wrong every 8200 bytes. (Oyvind Holm)
Solution:   Correct the utf_ptr2len_check_len() function and fix the problem
	    of displaying 0xf7 in utfc_ptr2len_check_len().
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.458
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set "$" doesn't move to the end of an
	    unprintable character, causing "y$" not to include that character.
	    (Fred Ma)
Solution:   Set "coladd" to move the cursor to the end of the character.
Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.459 (after 6.2.454)

Solution:   Reset "use_reg_one" at the right moment.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.462
Problem:    Finding a matching parenthesis does not correctly handle a
	    backslash in a trailing byte.
Solution:   Handle multi-byte characters correctly. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.2.463 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: An NTFS file system may contain files with extra info
	    streams.  The current method to copy them creates one and then
	    deletes it again.  (Peter Toennies)  Also, only three streams with
	    hard coded names are copied.
Solution:   Use BackupRead() to check which info streams the original file
	    contains and only copy these streams.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.464 (extra, after 6.2.427)
Problem:    Amiga: Compilation error with gcc. (Ali Akcaagac)

	    shell output when ignoring case.
Solution:   Skip 'O' and 'I' in tempname().
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.471
Problem:    "-L/usr/lib" is used in the link command, even though it's
	    supposed to be filtered out. "-lw" and "-ldl" are not
	    automatically added when needed for "-lXmu". (Antonio Colombo)
Solution:   Check for a space after the argument instead of before.  Also
	    remove "-R/usr/lib" if it's there.  Check for "-lw" and "-ldl"
	    before trying "-lXmu".
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/link.sh

Patch 6.2.472
Problem:    When using a FileChangedShell autocommand that changes the current
	    buffer, a buffer exists that can't be wiped out.
	    Also, Vim sometimes crashes when executing an external command
	    that changes the buffer and a FileChangedShell autocommand is
	    used.  (Hari Krishna Dara)
	    Users are confused by the warning for a file being changed outside
	    of Vim.
Solution:   Avoid that the window counter for a buffer is incremented twice.
	    Avoid that buf_check_timestamp() is used recursively.
	    Add a hint to look in the help for more info.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.473
Problem:    Using CTRL-] in a help buffer without a name causes a crash.
Solution:   Check for name to be present before using it. (Taro Muraoka)

Problem:    When Vim is starting up conversion is done unnecessarily.  Failure
	    to find the runtime files on Windows 98. (Randall W. Morris)
Solution:   Init enc_codepage negative, only use it when not negative.
	    Don't use GetFileAttributesW() on Windows 98 or earlier.
Files:	    src/globals.h, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c, src/os_mswin.c,
	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.475
Problem:    Commands after "perl <<EOF" are parsed as Vim commands when they

	    src/if_ruby.c, src/if_tcl.c, src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.476
Problem:    When reloading a hidden buffer changed outside of Vim and the
	    current buffer is read-only, the reloaded buffer becomes
	    read-only.  (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Save the 'readonly' flag of the reloaded buffer instead of the
	    current buffer.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.477
Problem:    Using remote_send(v:servername, "\<C-V>") causes Vim to hang.
	    (Yakov Lerner)
Solution:   When the resulting string is empty don't set received_from_client.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.478
Problem:    Win32: "--remote file" fails changing directory if the current
	    directory name starts with a single quote.  (Iestyn Walters)
Solution:   Add a backslash where it will be removed later.
Files:	    src/main.c, src/misc2.c, src/proto/misc2.pro

Patch 6.2.479
Problem:    The error message for errors during recovery goes unnoticed.
Solution:   Avoid that the hit-enter prompt overwrites the message.  Add a few
	    lines to make the error stand out.
Files:	    src/main.c, src/message.c, src/memline.c

Patch 6.2.480
Problem:    NetBeans: Using negative index in array.  backslash at end of
	    message may cause Vim to crash. (Xavier de Gaye)
Solution:   Initialize buf_list_used to zero. Check for trailing backslash.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.481
Problem:    When writing a file it is not possible to specify that hard and/or
	    symlinks are to be broken instead of preserved.
Solution:   Add the "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values to 'backupcopy'.
	    (Simon Ekstrand)
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/fileio.c, src/option.c, src/option.h

Patch 6.2.482
Problem:    Repeating insert of CTRL-K 1 S doesn't work.  The superscript 1 is
	    considered to be a digit. (Juergen Kraemer)
Solution:   In vim_isdigit() only accept '0' to '9'.  Use VIM_ISDIGIT() for
	    speed where possible.  Also add vim_isxdigit().

Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/config.h.in, src/configure.in,
	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.497 (extra)

Patch 6.2.506 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When 'encoding' is a codepage then reading a utf-8 file
	    only works when iconv is available.  Writing a file in another
	    codepage uses the wrong kind of conversion.

	    codepages and utf-8 without the need for iconv.
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/testdir/Make_dos.mak, src/testdir/test52.in,

Solution:   Add a type cast.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.511
Problem:    Tags in Russian help files are in utf-8 encoding, which may be
	    different from 'encoding'.
Solution:   Use the "TAG_FILE_ENCODING" field in the tags file to specify the
	    encoding of the tags.  Convert help tags from 'encoding' to the
	    tag file encoding when searching for matches, do the reverse when
	    listing help tags.
Files:	    runtime/doc/tagsrch.txt, src/ex_cmds.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.512
Problem:    Translating "\"\n" is useless. (Gerfried Fuchs)

	    simplified. (Nikolay Molchanov)
Solution:   Only check if the access mode is right.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.514
Problem:    When a highlight/syntax group name contains invalid characters
	    there is no warning.

	    invalid characters.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.515
Problem:    When using the options window 'swapfile' is reset.
Solution:   Use ":setlocal" instead of ":set".
Files:	    runtime/optwin.vim

Patch 6.2.516
Problem:    The sign column cannot be seen, looks like there are two spaces
	    before the text. (Rob Retter)

	    src/screen.c, src/syntax.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.517
Problem:    Using "r*" in Visual mode on multi-byte characters replaces
	    too many characters.  In Visual Block mode replacing with a
	    multi-byte character doesn't work.
Solution:   Adjust the operator end for the difference in byte length of the
	    original and the replaced character.  Insert all bytes of a
	    multi-byte character, take care of double-wide characters.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.518
Problem:    Last line of a window is not updated after using "J" and then "D".
	    (Adri Verhoef)
Solution:   When no line is found below a change that doesn't need updating,
	    update all lines below the change.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.519
Problem:    Mac: cannot read/write files in MacRoman format.
Solution:   Do internal conversion from/to MacRoman to/from utf-8 and latin1.
	    (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.520 (extra)
Problem:    The NSIS installer is outdated.
Solution:   Make it work with NSIS 2.0.  Also include console executables for
	    Win 95/98/ME and Win NT/2000/XP.  Use LZWA compression.  Use
	    "/oname" to avoid having to rename files before running NSIS.
Files:	    Makefile, nsis/gvim.nsi

Patch 6.2.521
Problem:    When using silent Ex mode the "changing a readonly file" warning
	    is omitted but the one second wait isn't. (Yakov Lerner)
Solution:   Skip the delay when "silent_mode" is set.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2.522
Problem:    GUI: when changing 'cmdheight' in the gvimrc file the window
	    layout is messed up. (Keith Dart)
Solution:   Skip updating the window layout when changing 'cmdheight' while
	    still starting up.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.523
Problem:    When loading a session and aborting when a swap file already
	    exists, the user is left with useless windows. (Robert Webb)
Solution:   Load one file before creating the windows.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.524 (extra, after 6.2.520)
Problem:    Win32: (un)installing gvimext.dll may fail if it was used.
	    The desktop and start menu links are created for the current user
	    instead of all users.
	    Using the home directory as working directory for the links is a
	    bad idea for multi-user systems.
	    Cannot use Vim from the "Open With..." menu.
Solution:   Force a reboot if necessary. (Alejandro Lopez-Valencia)  Also use
	    macros for the directory of the source and runtime files.  Use
	    "CSIDL_COMMON_*" instead of "CSIDL_*" when possible.
	    Do not specify a working directory in the links.
	    Add Vim to the "Open With..." menu. (Giuseppe Bilotta)
Files:	    nsis/gvim.nsi, src/dosinst.c, src/dosinst.h, src/uninstal.c

Patch 6.2.525
Problem:    When the history contains a very long line ":history" causes a
	    crash. (Volker Kiefel)

Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.2.526
Problem:    When s:lang is "ja" the Japanese menus are not used.
Solution:   Add 'encoding' to the language when there is no charset.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.2.527
Problem:    The 2html script uses ":wincmd p", which breaks when using some
	    autocommands.
Solution:   Remember the window numbers and jump to them with ":wincmd w".
	    Also add XHTML support. (Panagiotis Issaris)
Files:	    runtime/syntax/2html.vim

Patch 6.2.528
Problem:    NetBeans: Changes of the "~" command are not reported.
Solution:   Call netbeans_inserted() after performing "~". (Gordon Prieur)
	    Also change NetBeans debugging to append to the log file.
	    Also fix that "~" in Visual block mode changes too much if there
	    are multi-byte characters.
Files:	    src/nbdebug.c, src/normal.c, src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.529 (extra)
Problem:    VisVim only works for Admin.  Doing it for one user doesn't work.
	    (Alexandre Gouraud)
Solution:   When registering the module fails, simply continue.
Files:	    src/VisVim/VisVim.cpp

Patch 6.2.530
Problem:    Warning for missing prototype on the Amiga.
Solution:   Include time.h
Files:	    src/version.c

Patch 6.2.531
Problem:    In silent ex mode no messages are given, which makes debugging
	    very difficult.
Solution:   Do output messages when 'verbose' is set.
Files:	    src/message.c, src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.532 (extra)
Problem:    Compiling for Win32s with VC 4.1 doesn't work.
Solution:   Don't use CP_UTF8 if it's not defined.  Don't use CSIDL_COMMON*
	    when not defined.
Files:	    src/dosinst.h, src/fileio.c

Win32 console: After patch 6.2.398 Ex mode did not work. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Patch 6.3a.001
Problem:    Win32: if testing for the "--binary" option fails, diff isn't used
	    at all.
Solution:   Handle the "ok" flag properly. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/diff.c

Patch 6.3a.002
Problem:    NetBeans: An insert command from NetBeans beyond the end of a

Solution:   Use a local pos_T structure for the position.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.3a.003
Problem:    E315 error with auto-formatting comments. (Henry Van Roessel)
Solution:   Pass the line number to same_leader().
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.3a.004
Problem:    Test32 fails on Windows XP for the DJGPP version.  Renaming
	    test11.out fails.
Solution:   Don't try renaming, create new files to use for the test.
Files:	    src/testdir/test32.in, src/testdir/test32.ok

Patch 6.3a.005
Problem:    ":checkpath!" does not use 'includeexpr'.
Solution:   Use a file name that was found directly.  When a file was not
	    found and the located name is empty, use the rest of the line.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.3a.006
Problem:    "yip" moves the cursor to the first yanked line, but not to the
	    first column.  Looks like not all text was yanked. (Jens Paulus)
Solution:   Move the cursor to the first column.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.3a.007
Problem:    'cindent' recognizes "enum" but not "typedef enum".
Solution:   Skip over "typedef" before checking for "enum". (Helmut Stiegler)
	    Also avoid that searching for this item goes too far back.
Files:	    src/misc1.c, src/testdir/test3.in, src/testdir/test3.ok

Patch 6.3a.008 (extra)
Problem:    Windows 98: Some of the wide functions are not implemented,
	    resulting in file I/O to fail.  This depends on what Unicode
	    support is installed.
Solution:   Handle the failure and fall back to non-wide functions.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.3a.009
Problem:    Win32: Completion of filenames does not work properly when
	    'encoding' differs from the active code page.
Solution:   Use wide functions for expanding wildcards when appropriate.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.3a.010 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Characters in the window title that do not appear in the
	    active codepage are replaced by a question mark.
Solution:   Use DefWindowProcW() instead of DefWindowProc() when possible.
Files:	    src/glbl_ime.cpp, src/globals.h, src/proto/gui_w16.pro,
	    src/proto/gui_w32.pro, src/gui_w16.c, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.011
Problem:    Using the explorer plugin changes a local directory to the global
	    directory.
Solution:   Don't use ":chdir" to restore the current directory.  Make
	    "expand('%:p')" remove "/../" and "/./" items from the path.
Files:	    runtime/plugin/explorer.vim, src/eval.c, src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.3a.012 (extra)
Problem:    On Windows 98 the installer doesn't work, don't even get the "I
	    agree" button.  The check for the path ending in "vim" makes the
	    browse dialog hard to use.  The default path when no previous Vim
	    is installed is "c:\vim" instead of "c:\Program Files\Vim".
Solution:   Remove the background gradient command.  Change the
	    .onVerifyInstDir function to a leave function for the directory
	    page.  Don't let the install program default to c:\vim when no
	    path could be found.
Files:	    nsis/gvim.nsi, src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.3a.013 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Characters in the menu that are not in the active codepage
	    are garbled.
Solution:   Convert menu strings from 'encoding' to the active codepage.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.014
Problem:    Using multi-byte text and highlighting in a statusline causes gaps
	    to appear. (Helmut Stiegler)
Solution:   Advance the column by text width instead of number of bytes.  Add
	    the vim_strnsize() function.
Files:	    src/charset.c, src/proto/charset.pro, src/screen.c

Patch 6.3a.015
Problem:    Using the "select all" menu item when 'insertmode' is set and
	    clicking the mouse button doesn't return to Insert mode.  The
	    Buffers/Delete menu doesn't offer a choice to abandon a changed
	    buffer.  (Jens Paulus)
Solution:   Don't use CTRL-\ CTRL-N.  Add ":confirm" for the Buffers menu
	    items.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.3a.016
Problem:    After cancelling the ":confirm" dialog the error message and
	    hit-enter prompt may not be displayed properly.
Solution:   Flush output after showing the dialog.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.3a.017
Problem:    servername() doesn't work when Vim was started with the "-X"

	    name.  (Robert Nowotniak)
Solution:   Force connecting to the X server when using client-server
	    commands.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/globals.h, src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.3a.018 (after 6.3a.017)
Problem:    Compiler warning for return value of make_connection().
Solution:   Use void return type.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.3a.019 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: typing non-latin1 characters doesn't work.
Solution:   Invoke _OnChar() directly to avoid that the argument is truncated
	    to a byte.  Convert the UTF-16 character to bytes according to
	    'encoding' and ignore 'termencoding'.  Same for _OnSysChar().
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.020 (extra)
Problem:    Missing support for AROS (AmigaOS reimplementation).  Amiga GUI
	    doesn't work.
Solution:   Add AROS support.  (Adam Chodorowski)
	    Fix Amiga GUI problems. (Georg Steger, Ali Akcaagac)
Files:	    Makefile, src/Make_aros.mak, src/gui_amiga.c, src/gui_amiga.h,
	    src/memfile.c, src/os_amiga.c, src/term.c

Patch 6.3a.021 (after 6.3a.017)
Problem:    Can't compile with X11 but without GUI.
Solution:   Put use of "gui.in_use" inside an #ifdef.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.3a.022
Problem:    When typing Tabs when 'softtabstop' is used and 'list' is set a
	    tab is counted for two spaces.
Solution:   Use the "L" flag in 'cpoptions' to tell whether a tab is counted
	    as two spaces or as 'tabstop'. (Antony Scriven)
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/edit.c

Patch 6.3a.023
Problem:    Completion on the command line doesn't handle backslashes
	    properly.  Only the tail of matches is shown, even when not
	    completing filenames.
Solution:   When turning the string into a pattern double backslashes.  Don't
	    omit the path when not expanding files or directories.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.3a.024
Problem:    The "save all" toolbar item fails for buffers that don't have a
	    name.  When using ":wa" or closing the Vim window and there are
	    nameless buffers, browsing for a name may cause the name being
	    given to the wrong buffer or not stored properly.  ":browse" only
	    worked for one file.
Solution:   Use ":confirm browse" for "save all".
	    Pass buffer argument to setfname().  Restore "browse" flag and
	    "forceit" after doing the work for one file.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim, src/buffer.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/ex_cmds2.c,
	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/ex_getln.c, src/fileio.c, src/memline.c,

Problem:    Editing files on Windows 98 doesn't work when 'encoding' is
	    "utf-8" (Antoine Mechelynck)
	    Warning for missing function prototype.
Solution:   For all wide functions check if it failed because it is not
	    implemented.  Use ANSI function declaration for char_to_string().
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c, src/os_mswin.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.3a.027 (extra, after 6.3a.026)
Problem:    Compiler warning for function argument.
Solution:   Declare both char and WCHAR arrays.
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.028

Solution:   Make a copy of the redo buffer when executing a function.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.3b.001 (extra)

Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak

Patch 6.3b.002
Problem:    Win32: conversion during file write fails when a double-byte
	    character is split over two writes.
Solution:   Fix the conversion retry without a trailing byte. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.3b.003 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When compiling with Borland C 5.5 and 'encoding' is "utf-8"
	    then Vim can't open files under MS-Windows 98. (Antoine J.
	    Mechelynck)
Solution:   Don't use _wstat(), _wopen() and _wfopen() in this situation.
Files:	    src/os_mswin.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.3b.004
Problem:    ":helpgrep" includes a trailing CR in the text line.
Solution:   Remove the CR.
Files:	    src/quickfix.c

Patch 6.3b.006
Problem:    When using "mswin.vim", CTRL-V in Insert mode leaves cursor before
	    last pasted character.  (Mathew Davis)
Solution:   Use the same Paste() function as in menu.vim.
Files:	    runtime/mswin.vim

Patch 6.3b.007
Problem:    Session file doesn't restore view on windows properly. (Robert
	    Webb)

	    that the view, cursor position and size are restored properly.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.3b.008

	    Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Don't assume that using getexline() means the command was typed.

Patch 6.3b.009 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When the -P argument is not found in a window title, there
	    is no error message.
Solution:   When the window can't be found give an error message and exit.
	    Also use try/except to catch failing to open the MDI window.
	    (Michael Wookey)
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 6.3b.010
Problem:    Win32: Using the "-D" argument and expanding arguments may cause a
	    hang, because the terminal isn't initialized yet. (Vince Negri)
Solution:   Don't go into debug mode before the terminal is initialized.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.3b.011
Problem:    Using CTRL-\ e while obtaining an expression aborts the command
	    line. (Hari Krishna Dara)

	    lines than what is room for. (Shizhu Pan)
Solution:   When deciding to call shell_resized(), also compare the text area
	    size with Rows and Columns, not just with screen_Rows and
	    screen_Columns.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Fixed							*fixed-6.4*
-----

"dFxd;" deleted the character under the cursor, "d;" didn't remember the
exclusiveness of the motion.

When using "set laststatus=2 cmdheight=2" in the .gvimrc you may only get one
line for the cmdline. (Christian Robinson)  Invoke command_height() after the
GUI has started up.

Gcc would warn "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict -aliasing
rules".  Avoid using typecasts for variable pointers.

Gcc 3.x interprets the -MM argument differently.  Change "-I /path" to
"-isystem /path" for "make depend".


Patch 6.3.001
Problem:    ":browse split" gives the file selection dialog twice. (Gordon
	    Bazeley)  Same problem for ":browse diffpatch".
Solution:   Reset cmdmod.browse before calling do_ecmd().

Patch 6.3.002
Problem:    When using translated help files with non-ASCII latin1 characters
	    in the first line the utf-8 detection is wrong.
Solution:   Properly detect utf-8 characters.  When a mix of encodings is
	    detected continue with the next language and avoid a "no matches"
	    error because of "got_int" being set.  Add the directory name to
	    the error message for a duplicate tag.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.3.003
Problem:    Crash when using a console dialog and the first choice does not

Patch 6.3.005
Problem:    Crash when searching for a pattern with a character offset and
	    starting in a closed fold. (Frank Butler)

	    that a pattern with a character offset relative to the end isn't
	    read back from the viminfo properly.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.3.006
Problem:    ":breakadd file *foo" prepends the current directory to the file

Solution:   Save the command line when invoking the completion function.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.3.012
Problem:    Internal lalloc(0) error when using a complicated multi-line
	    pattern in a substitute command. (Luc Hermitte)
Solution:   Avoid going past the end of a line.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.3.013
Problem:    Crash when editing a command line and typing CTRL-R = to evaluate

	    wrong. (Simon Liang)
Solution:   Use the part of the locale name after "zh_".
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.3.015
Problem:    The string that winrestcmd() returns may end in garbage.
Solution:   NUL-terminate the string. (Walter Briscoe)

	    delete a word but only a combining character of the first
	    character, if there is one. (Raphael Finkel)
Solution:   Correctly check that one character is being deleted.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.3.021
Problem:    When the last character of a file name is a multi-byte character
	    and the last byte is a path separator, the file cannot be edited.
Solution:   Check for the last byte to be part of a multi-byte character.
	    (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.3.022 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When the last character of a file name is a multi-byte
	    character and the last byte is a path separator, the file cannot
	    be written.  A trail byte that is a space makes that a file cannot
	    be opened from the command line.
Solution:   Recognize double-byte characters when parsing the command line.
	    In mch_stat() check for the last byte to be part of a multi-byte
	    character.  (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c, src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.023
Problem:    When the "to" part of a mapping starts with its "from" part,
	    abbreviations for the same characters is not possible.  For
	    example, when <Space> is mapped to something that starts with a
	    space, typing <Space> does not expand abbreviations.
Solution:   Only disable expanding abbreviations when a mapping is not
	    remapped, don't disable it when the RHS of a mapping starts with
	    the LHS.
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.3.024
Problem:    In a few places a string in allocated memory is not terminated
	    with a NUL.
Solution:   Add ga_append(NUL) in script_get(), gui_do_findrepl() and
	    serverGetVimNames().
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/gui.c, src/if_xcmdsrv.c, src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.025 (extra)
Problem:    Missing NUL for list of server names.
Solution:   Add ga_append(NUL) in serverGetVimNames().
Files:	    src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.026
Problem:    When ~/.vim/after/syntax/syncolor.vim contains a command that
	    reloads the colors an endless loop and/or a crash may occur.
Solution:   Only free the old value of an option when it was originally
	    allocated.  Limit recursiveness of init_highlight() to 5 levels.
Files:	    src/option.c, src/syntax.c

Patch 6.3.027
Problem:    VMS: Writing a file may insert extra CR characters.  Not all
	    terminals are recognized correctly.  Vt320 doesn't support colors.
	    Environment variables are not expanded correctly.
Solution:   Use another method to write files.  Add vt320 termcap codes for
	    colors.  (Zoltan Arpadffy)
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/misc1.c, src/os_unix.c, src/structs.h,
	    src/term.c

Patch 6.3.028
Problem:    When appending to a file the BOM marker may be written.  (Alex
	    Jakushev)
Solution:   Do not write the BOM marker when appending.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.3.029
Problem:    Crash when inserting a line break. (Walter Briscoe)
Solution:   In the syntax highlighting code, don't use an old state after a
	    change was made, current_col may be past the end of the line.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.3.030
Problem:    GTK 2: Crash when sourcing a script that deletes the menus, sets
	    'encoding' to "utf-8" and loads the menus again.  GTK error
	    message when tooltip text is in a wrong encoding.
Solution:   Don't copy characters from the old screen to the new screen when
	    switching 'encoding' to utf-8, they may be invalid.  Only set the
	    tooltip when it is valid utf-8.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c, src/mbyte.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro, src/screen.c

Patch 6.3.031
Problem:    When entering a mapping and pressing Tab halfway the command line
	    isn't redrawn properly. (Adri Verhoef)

	    lines below the change.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.3.040
Problem:    Error handling does not always work properly and may cause a
	    buffer to be marked as if it's viewed in a window while it isn't.
	    Also when selecting "Abort" at the attention prompt.
Solution:   Add enter_cleanup() and leave_cleanup() functions to move
	    saving/restoring things for error handling to one place.
	    Clear a buffer read error when it's unloaded.

	    scrolling the text up. (Gautam)
Solution:   Scroll over the closed fold.
Files:	    src/move.c

Patch 6.3.043
Problem:    'hlsearch' highlighting sometimes disappears when inserting text
	    in PHP code with syntax highlighting. (Marcel Svitalsky)

	    index.  The pointers may become invalid when searching in other
	    lines.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.3.044 (extra)
Problem:    Mac: When 'linespace' is non-zero the Insert mode cursor leaves

	    behavior, especially for a modeline. (Ciaran McCreesh)
Solution:   Don't allow setting termcap options or 'printdevice' in a
	    modeline.  Don't list options for "termcap" and "all" in a
	    modeline.  Don't allow unusual characters in 'filetype', 'syntax',
	    'backupext', 'keymap', 'patchmode' and 'langmenu'.

Patch 6.3.052 (extra)
Problem:    Windows 98: typed keys that are not ASCII may not work properly.
	    For example with a Russian input method. (Jiri Jezdinsky)

Patch 6.3.053
Problem:    Win32: ":loadview" cannot find a file with non-ASCII characters.
	    (Valerie Kondakoff)

Problem:    Can't use getcmdline(), getcmdpos() or setcmdpos() with <C-R>=
	    when editing a command line.  Using <C-\>e may crash Vim. (Peter
	    Winters)
Solution:   When moving ccline out of the way for recursive use, make it
	    available to the functions that need it.  Also save and restore

	    the end of getcmdline().
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.3.056
Problem:    The last characters of a multi-byte file name may not be displayed
