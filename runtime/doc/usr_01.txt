==============================================================================
*01.1*	Two manuals

The Vim documentation consists of two parts:

1. The User manual
   Task oriented explanations, from simple to complex.  Reads from start to
   end like a book.

2. The Reference manual
   Precise description of how everything in Vim works.

The notation used in these manuals is explained here: |notation|


JUMPING AROUND

The text contains hyperlinks between the two parts, allowing you to quickly
jump between the description of an editing task and a precise explanation of
the commands and options used for it.  Use these two commands:

	Press  CTRL-]  to jump to a subject under the cursor.
	Press  CTRL-O  to jump back (repeat to go further back).

Many links are in vertical bars, like this: |bars|.  The bars themselves may
be hidden or invisible, see below.  An option name, like 'number', a command
in double quotes like ":write" and any other word can also be used as a link.
Try it out: Move the cursor to  CTRL-]  and press CTRL-] on it.

Other subjects can be found with the ":help" command, see |help.txt|.

The bars and stars are usually hidden with the |conceal| feature.  They also
use |hl-Ignore|, using the same color for the text as the background.  You can
make them visible with: >
	:set conceallevel=0
	:hi link HelpBar Normal
	:hi link HelpStar Normal

==============================================================================
*01.2*	Vim installed					   *setup-vimrc_example*

It's not required for this tutorial, but we provide an example vimrc you may
use:

	:!cp -i $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

If the file already exists you probably want to keep it.

For more info see |vimrc|.

==============================================================================
*01.3*	Using the Vim tutor			         *tutor* *vimtutor*

Instead of reading the text (boring!) you can use the vimtutor to learn your
first Vim commands.  This is a 30 minute tutorial that teaches the most basic
Vim functionality hands-on.

To start the tutorial, execute >

        :Tutor
<
from within nvim. The tutorial will lead you from that point. Have fun!

*01.4*	Copyright					*manual-copyright*

The Vim user manual and reference manual are Copyright (c) 1988-2003 by Bram

conditions set forth in the Open Publication License, v1.0 or later.  The

							*frombook*
Parts of the user manual come from the book "Vi IMproved - Vim" by Steve
Oualline (published by New Riders Publishing, ISBN: 0735710015).  The Open
Publication License applies to this book.  Only selected parts are included
and these have been modified (e.g., by removing the pictures, updating the
text for Vim 6.0 and later, fixing mistakes).  The omission of the |frombook|
tag does not mean that the text does not come from the book.

Many thanks to Steve Oualline and New Riders for creating this book and
publishing it under the OPL!  It has been a great help while writing the user
manual.  Not only by providing literal text, but also by setting the tone and
style.

If you make money through selling the manuals, you are strongly encouraged to
donate part of the profit to help AIDS victims in Uganda.  See |iccf|.
