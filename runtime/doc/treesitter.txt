Treesitter integration                                 *treesitter*

Nvim integrates the `tree-sitter` library for incremental parsing of buffers:
https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/

WARNING: Treesitter support is still experimental and subject to frequent
changes. This documentation may also not fully reflect the latest changes.

                                      Type |gO| to see the table of contents.

==============================================================================
PARSER FILES                                              *treesitter-parsers*

Parsers are the heart of tree-sitter. They are libraries that tree-sitter will
search for in the `parser` runtime directory. By default, Nvim bundles only
parsers for C, Lua, and Vimscript, but parsers can be installed manually or
via a plugin like https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter.
Parsers are searched for as `parser/{lang}.*` in any 'runtimepath' directory.
If multiple parsers for the same language are found, the first one is used.
(This typically implies the priority "user config > plugins > bundled".
A parser can also be loaded manually using a full path: >

    vim.treesitter.require_language("python", "/path/to/python.so")
<
==============================================================================
LANGUAGE TREES                                       *treesitter-languagetree*
                                                                *LanguageTree*

As buffers can contain multiple languages (e.g., Vimscript commands in a Lua
file), multiple parsers may be needed to parse the full buffer. These are
combined in a |LanguageTree| object.

To create a LanguageTree (parser object) for a buffer and a given language,
use >

    tsparser = vim.treesitter.get_parser(bufnr, lang)
<
`bufnr=0` can be used for current buffer. `lang` will default to 'filetype'.
Currently, the parser will be retained for the lifetime of a buffer but this
is subject to change. A plugin should keep a reference to the parser object as
long as it wants incremental updates.

Whenever you need to access the current syntax tree, parse the buffer: >

    tstree = tsparser:parse()
<
This will return a table of immutable |treesitter-tree|s that represent the
current state of the buffer. When the plugin wants to access the state after a
(possible) edit it should call `parse()` again. If the buffer wasn't edited,
the same tree will be returned again without extra work. If the buffer was
parsed before, incremental parsing will be done of the changed parts.

Note: To use the parser directly inside a |nvim_buf_attach()| Lua callback, you
must call |get_parser()| before you register your callback. But preferably
parsing shouldn't be done directly in the change callback anyway as they will
be very frequent. Rather a plugin that does any kind of analysis on a tree
should use a timer to throttle too frequent updates.

See |lua-treesitter-languagetree| for the list of available methods.

TREESITTER TREES                                             *treesitter-tree*
                                                                      *tstree*

A "treesitter tree" represents the parsed contents of a buffer, which can be
used to perform further analysis. It is a |luaref-userdata| reference to an
object held by the tree-sitter library.

An instance `tstree` of a treesitter tree supports the following methods.

tstree:root()                                           *tstree:root()*
    Return the root node of this tree.

tstree:copy()                                           *tstree:copy()*
    Returns a copy of the `tstree`.

==============================================================================
TREESITTER NODES                                             *treesitter-node*
                                                                      *tsnode*

A "treesitter node" represents one specific element of the parsed contents of
a buffer, which can be captured by a |Query| for, e.g., highlighting. It is a
|luaref-userdata| reference to an object held by the tree-sitter library.

An instance `tsnode` of a treesitter node supports the following methods.

tsnode:parent()                                         *tsnode:parent()*
    Get the node's immediate parent.

    Iterates over all the direct children of {tsnode}, regardless of whether
    they are named or not.
    Returns the child node plus the eventual field name corresponding to this
    child node.

tsnode:field({name})                                    *tsnode:field()*
    Returns a table of the nodes corresponding to the {name} field.

tsnode:child_count()                                    *tsnode:child_count()*
    Get the node's number of children.

tsnode:child({index})                                   *tsnode:child()*
    Get the node's child at the given {index}, where zero represents the first
    child.

tsnode:named_child_count()                         *tsnode:named_child_count()*
    Get the node's number of named children.

tsnode:named_child({index})                              *tsnode:named_child()*
    Get the node's named child at the given {index}, where zero represents the
    first named child.

tsnode:start()                                          *tsnode:start()*
    Get the node's start position. Return three values: the row, column and
    total byte count (all zero-based).

tsnode:end_()                                           *tsnode:end_()*
    Get the node's end position. Return three values: the row, column and
    total byte count (all zero-based).

tsnode:range()                                          *tsnode:range()*
    Get the range of the node. Return four values: the row, column of the
    start position, then the row, column of the end position.

tsnode:type()                                           *tsnode:type()*
    Get the node's type as a string.

tsnode:named()                                          *tsnode:named()*
    Check if the node is named. Named nodes correspond to named rules in the
    grammar, whereas anonymous nodes correspond to string literals in the
    grammar.

tsnode:missing()                                        *tsnode:missing()*
    Check if the node is missing. Missing nodes are inserted by the parser in
    order to recover from certain kinds of syntax errors.

tsnode:has_error()                                      *tsnode:has_error()*
    Check if the node is a syntax error or contains any syntax errors.

tsnode:sexpr()                                          *tsnode:sexpr()*
    Get an S-expression representing the node as a string.

tsnode:id()                                             *tsnode:id()*
    Get an unique identifier for the node inside its own tree.

    No guarantees are made about this identifier's internal representation,
    except for being a primitive Lua type with value equality (so not a
    table). Presently it is a (non-printable) string.

    Note: The `id` is not guaranteed to be unique for nodes from different
    trees.

                                                *tsnode:descendant_for_range()*
tsnode:descendant_for_range({start_row}, {start_col}, {end_row}, {end_col})
    Get the smallest node within this node that spans the given range of (row,
    column) positions

                                          *tsnode:named_descendant_for_range()*
tsnode:named_descendant_for_range({start_row}, {start_col}, {end_row}, {end_col})
    Get the smallest named node within this node that spans the given range of
    (row, column) positions

==============================================================================
TREESITTER QUERIES                                          *treesitter-query*

Treesitter queries are a way to extract information about a parsed |tstree|,
e.g., for the purpose of highlighting. Briefly, a `query` consists of one or
more patterns. A `pattern` is defined over node types in the syntax tree. A
`match` corresponds to specific elements of the syntax tree which match a
pattern. Patterns may optionally define captures and predicates. A `capture`
allows you to associate names with a specific node in a pattern. A `predicate`
adds arbitrary metadata and conditional data to a match.

Queries are written in a lisp-like language documented in
https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#query-syntax
Note: The predicates listed there page differ from those Nvim supports. See
|treesitter-predicates| for a complete list of predicates supported by Nvim.

Nvim looks for queries as `*.scm` files in a `queries` directory under
`runtimepath`, where each file contains queries for a specific language and
purpose, e.g., `queries/lua/highlights.scm` for highlighting Lua files.
By default, the first query on `runtimepath` is used (which usually implies
that user config takes precedence over plugins, which take precedence over
queries bundled with Neovim). If a query should extend other queries instead
of replacing them, use |treesitter-query-modeline-extends|.

See |lua-treesitter-query| for the list of available methods for working with
treesitter queries from Lua.


TREESITTER QUERY PREDICATES                            *treesitter-predicates*

Predicates are special scheme nodes that are evaluated to conditionally capture
nodes. For example, the |eq?| predicate can be used as follows: >

    ((identifier) @foo (#eq? @foo "foo"))
<
to only match identifier corresponding to the `"foo"` text.

The following predicates are built in:

    `eq?`                                            *treesitter-predicate-eq?*
        Match a string against the text corresponding to a node: >
            ((identifier) @foo (#eq? @foo "foo"))
            ((node1) @left (node2) @right (#eq? @left @right))
<
    `match?`                                      *treesitter-predicate-match?*
    `vim-match?`                              *treesitter-predicate-vim-match?*
         Match a |regexp| against the text corresponding to a node: >
            ((identifier) @constant (#match? @constant "^[A-Z_]+$"))
<         Note: The `^` and `$` anchors will match the start and end of the
               node's text.

    `lua-match?`                              *treesitter-predicate-lua-match?*
         Match |lua-patterns| against the text corresponding to a node,
         similar to `match?`

    `contains?`                                *treesitter-predicate-contains?*
        Match a string against parts of the text corresponding to a node: >
            ((identifier) @foo (#contains? @foo "foo"))
            ((identifier) @foo-bar (#contains? @foo-bar "foo" "bar"))
<
    `any-of?`                                    *treesitter-predicate-any-of?*
        Match any of the given strings against the text corresponding to
        a node: >
            ((identifier) @foo (#any-of? @foo "foo" "bar"))
<
        This is the recommended way to check if the node matches one of many
        keywords, as it has been optimized for this.

                                                 *lua-treesitter-not-predicate*
Each predicate has a `not-` prefixed predicate that is just the negation of
the predicate.

Further predicates can be added via `vim.treesitter.query.`|add_predicate()|.
Use `vim.treesitter.query.`|list_predicates()| to list all available
predicates.


TREESITTER QUERY DIRECTIVES                            *treesitter-directives*

Treesitter directives store metadata for a node or match and perform side
effects. For example, the |set!| predicate sets metadata on the match or node: >

        ((identifier) @foo (#set! "type" "parameter"))
<
The following directives are built in:

    `set!`                                          *treesitter-directive-set!*
        Sets key/value metadata for a specific match or capture. Value is
        accessible as either `metadata[key]` (match specific) or
        `metadata[capture_id][key]` (capture specific).

        Parameters: ~
            {capture_id} (optional)
            {key}
            {value}

        Examples: >
            ((identifier) @foo (#set! @foo "kind" "parameter"))
            ((node1) @left (node2) @right (#set! "type" "pair"))
<
    `offset!`                                      *treesitter-directive-offset!*
        Takes the range of the captured node and applies an offset. This will
        generate a new range object for the captured node as
        `metadata[capture_id].range`.

        Parameters: ~
            {capture_id}
            {start_row}
            {start_col}
            {end_row}
            {end_col}

        Example: >
            ((identifier) @constant (#offset! @constant 0 1 0 -1))
<

Further directives can be added via `vim.treesitter.query.`|add_directive()|.
Use `vim.treesitter.query.`|list_directives()| to list all available
directives.


TREESITTER QUERY MODELINES                          *treesitter-query-modeline*

Neovim supports to customize the behavior of the queries using a set of
"modelines", that is comments in the queries starting with `;`. Here are the
currently supported modeline alternatives:

    `inherits: {lang}...`                     *treesitter-query-modeline-inherits*
        Specifies that this query should inherit the queries from {lang}.
        This will recursively descend in the queries of {lang} unless wrapped
        in parentheses: `({lang})`.
        Note: This is meant to be used to include queries from another
        language. If you want your query to extend the queries of the same
        language, use `extends`.

    `extends`                                  *treesitter-query-modeline-extends*
        Specifies that this query should be used as an extension for the
        query, i.e. that it should be merged with the others.
        Note: The order of the extensions, and the query that will be used as
        a base depends on your 'runtimepath' value.

Note: These modeline comments must be at the top of the query, but can be
repeated, for example, the following two modeline blocks are both valid: >

    ;; inherits: foo,bar
    ;; extends

    ;; extends
    ;;
    ;; inherits: baz
<
==============================================================================
TREESITTER SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING                          *treesitter-highlight*

Syntax highlighting is specified through queries named `highlights.scm`,
which match a |tsnode| in the parsed |tstree| to a `capture` that can be
assigned a highlight group. For example, the query >

    (parameters (identifier) @parameter)
<
matches any `identifier` node inside a function `parameter` node (e.g., the
`bar` in `foo(bar)`) to the capture named `@parameter`. It is also possible to
match literal expressions (provided the parser returns them): >

    "return" @keyword.return
<
Assuming a suitable parser and `highlights.scm` query is found in runtimepath,
treesitter highlighting for the current buffer can be enabled simply via
|vim.treesitter.start()|.

                                                 *treesitter-highlight-groups*
The capture names, with `@` included, are directly usable as highlight groups.
For many commonly used captures, the corresponding highlight groups are linked
to Nvim's standard |highlight-groups| by default but can be overridden in
colorschemes.

A fallback system is implemented, so that more specific groups fallback to
more generic ones. For instance, in a language that has separate doc comments,
`@comment.doc` could be used. If this group is not defined, the highlighting
for an ordinary `@comment` is used. This way, existing color schemes already
work out of the box, but it is possible to add more specific variants for
queries that make them available.

As an additional rule, capture highlights can always be specialized by
language, by appending the language name after an additional dot. For
instance, to highlight comments differently per language: >

    hi @comment.c guifg=Blue
    hi @comment.lua @guifg=DarkBlue
    hi link @comment.doc.java String
<
The following captures are linked by default to standard |group-name|s:
>
    @text.literal      Comment
    @text.reference    Identifier
    @text.title        Title
    @text.uri          Underlined
    @text.underline    Underlined
    @text.todo         Todo

    @comment           Comment
    @punctuation       Delimiter

    @constant          Constant
    @constant.builtin  Special
    @constant.macro    Define
    @define            Define
    @macro             Macro

    @label             Label
    @operator          Operator
    @keyword           Keyword
    @exception         Exception

    @variable          Identifier
    @type              Type
    @type.definition   Typedef
    @storageclass      StorageClass
    @structure         Structure
    @namespace         Identifier
    @include           Include
    @preproc           PreProc
    @debug             Debug
    @tag               Tag
<
                                                  *treesitter-highlight-spell*
The special `@spell` capture can be used to indicate that a node should be
spell checked by Nvim's builtin |spell| checker. For example, the following
capture marks comments as to be checked: >

    (comment) @spell
<

There is also `@nospell` which disables spellchecking regions with `@spell`.

                                                *treesitter-highlight-conceal*
Treesitter highlighting supports |conceal| via the `conceal` metadata. By
convention, nodes to be concealed are captured as `@conceal`, but any capture
can be used. For example, the following query can be used to hide code block
delimiters in Markdown: >

    (fenced_code_block_delimiter) @conceal (#set! conceal "")
<
It is also possible to replace a node with a single character, which (unlike
legacy syntax) can be given a custom highlight. For example, the following
(ill-advised) query replaces the `!=` operator by a Unicode glyph, which is
still highlighted the same as other operators: >

    "!=" @operator (#set! conceal "≠")
<
Conceals specified in this way respect 'conceallevel'.

                                               *treesitter-highlight-priority*
Treesitter uses |nvim_buf_set_extmark()| to set highlights with a default
priority of 100. This enables plugins to set a highlighting priority lower or
higher than tree-sitter. It is also possible to change the priority of an
individual query pattern manually by setting its `"priority"` metadata
attribute: >

    (super_important_node) @ImportantHighlight (#set! "priority" 105)
<

        string[] List of supported predicates.

parse_query({lang}, {query})                                   *parse_query()*
    Parse {query} as a string. (If the query is in a file, the caller should
    read the contents into a string before calling).

    Returns a `Query` (see |lua-treesitter-query|) object which can be used to search nodes in
    the syntax tree for the patterns defined in {query} using `iter_*` methods below.

    Exposes `info` and `captures` with additional context about {query}.
    • `captures` contains the list of unique capture names defined in {query}.
      -`info.captures` also points to `captures`.
    • `info.patterns` contains information about predicates.

    Parameters: ~
      • {lang}   (string) Language to use for the query
      • {query}  (string) Query in s-expr syntax

    Return: ~
        Query Parsed query

                                                       *Query:iter_captures()*
Query:iter_captures({self}, {node}, {source}, {start}, {stop})
    Iterate over all captures from all matches inside {node}

    {source} is needed if the query contains predicates; then the caller must
    ensure to use a freshly parsed tree consistent with the current text of
    the buffer (if relevant). {start_row} and {end_row} can be used to limit
    matches inside a row range (this is typically used with root node as the
    {node}, i.e., to get syntax highlight matches in the current viewport).
    When omitted, the {start} and {end} row values are used from the given
    node.

    The iterator returns three values: a numeric id identifying the capture,
    the captured node, and metadata from any directives processing the match.
    The following example shows how to get captures by name: >

     for id, node, metadata in query:iter_captures(tree:root(), bufnr, first, last) do
       local name = query.captures[id] -- name of the capture in the query
       -- typically useful info about the node:
       local type = node:type() -- type of the captured node
       local row1, col1, row2, col2 = node:range() -- range of the capture
       ... use the info here ...
     end
<

    Parameters: ~
      • {node}    userdata |tsnode| under which the search will occur
      • {source}  (number|string) Source buffer or string to extract text from
      • {start}   (number) Starting line for the search
      • {stop}    (number) Stopping line for the search (end-exclusive)
      • {self}

    Return: ~
        (number) capture Matching capture id
        (table) capture_node Capture for {node}
        (table) metadata for the {capture}

                                                        *Query:iter_matches()*
Query:iter_matches({self}, {node}, {source}, {start}, {stop})
    Iterates the matches of self on a given range.

    Iterate over all matches within a {node}. The arguments are the same as
    for |Query:iter_captures()| but the iterated values are different: an
    (1-based) index of the pattern in the query, a table mapping capture
    indices to nodes, and metadata from any directives processing the match.
    If the query has more than one pattern, the capture table might be sparse
    and e.g. `pairs()` method should be used over `ipairs` . Here is an example iterating over all captures in every match: >

     for pattern, match, metadata in cquery:iter_matches(tree:root(), bufnr, first, last) do
       for id, node in pairs(match) do
         local name = query.captures[id]
         -- `node` was captured by the `name` capture in the match

         local node_data = metadata[id] -- Node level metadata

         ... use the info here ...
       end
     end
<

    Parameters: ~
      • {node}    userdata |tsnode| under which the search will occur
      • {source}  (number|string) Source buffer or string to search
      • {start}   (number) Starting line for the search
      • {stop}    (number) Stopping line for the search (end-exclusive)
      • {self}

    Return: ~
        (number) pattern id
        (table) match
        (table) metadata

set_query({lang}, {query_name}, {text})                          *set_query()*
    Sets the runtime query named {query_name} for {lang}

    This allows users to override any runtime files and/or configuration set
    by plugins.

    Parameters: ~
      • {lang}        (string) Language to use for the query
      • {query_name}  (string) Name of the query (e.g., "highlights")

    Parameters: ~
      • {self}

new({source}, {lang}, {opts})                             *languagetree.new()*
    A |LanguageTree| holds the treesitter parser for a given language {lang}
    used to parse a buffer. As the buffer may contain injected languages, the LanguageTree needs to store parsers for these child languages as well (which in turn
    may contain child languages themselves, hence the name).

    Parameters: ~
      • {source}  (number|string) Buffer or a string of text to parse
      • {lang}    (string) Root language this tree represents
      • {opts}    (table|nil) Optional keyword arguments:
                  • injections table Mapping language to injection query
                    strings. This is useful for overriding the built-in
                    runtime file searching for the injection language query
                    per language.

    Return: ~
        LanguageTree |LanguageTree| parser object
