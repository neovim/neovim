==============================================================================
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES				*incompatible-7*

These changes are incompatible with previous releases.  Check this list if you
run into a problem when upgrading from Vim 6.x to 7.0.

A ":write file" command no longer resets the 'modified' flag of the buffer,
unless the '+' flag is in 'cpoptions' |cpo-+|.  This was illogical, since the
buffer is still modified compared to the original file.  And when undoing
all changes the file would actually be marked modified.  It does mean that
":quit" fails now.

":helpgrep" now uses a help window to display a match.

In an argument list double quotes could be used to include spaces in a file
name.  This caused a difference between ":edit" and ":next" for escaping
double quotes and it is incompatible with some versions of Vi.
	Command			Vim 6.x	file name	Vim 7.x file name ~
	:edit foo\"888		foo"888			foo"888
	:next foo\"888		foo888			foo"888
	:next a\"b c\"d		ab cd			a"b  and  c"d

In a |literal-string| a single quote can be doubled to get one.
":echo 'a''b'" would result in "a b", but now that two quotes stand for one it
results in "a'b".

When overwriting a file with ":w! fname" there was no warning for when "fname"
was being edited by another Vim.  Vim now gives an error message |E768|.

The support for Mac OS 9 has been removed.

Files ending in .tex now have 'filetype' set to "context", "plaintex", or
"tex".  |ft-tex-plugin|


Minor incompatibilities:

For filetype detection: For many types, use */.dir/filename instead of
~/.dir/filename, so that it also works for other user's files.

For quite a few filetypes the indent settings have been moved from the
filetype plugin to the indent plugin.  If you used: >
	:filetype plugin on
Then some indent settings may be missing.  You need to use: >
	:filetype plugin indent on

":0verbose" now sets 'verbose' to zero instead of one.

Removed the old and incomplete "VimBuddy" code.

Buffers without a name report "No Name" instead of "No File".  It was
confusing for buffers with a name and 'buftype' set to "nofile".

When ":file xxx" is used in a buffer without a name, the alternate file name
isn't set.  This avoids creating buffers without a name, they are not useful.

The "2html.vim" script now converts closed folds to HTML.  This means the HTML
looks like it's displayed, with the same folds open and closed.  Use "zR", or
"let html_ignore_folding=1", if no folds should appear in the HTML. (partly by
Carl Osterwisch)
Diff mode is now also converted to HTML as it is displayed.

Win32: The effect of the <F10> key depended on 'winaltkeys'.  Now it depends
on whether <F10> has been mapped or not.  This allows mapping <F10> without
changing 'winaltkeys'.

When 'octal' is in 'nrformats' and using CTRL-A on "08" it became "018", which
is illogical.  Now it becomes "9".  The leading zero(s) is(are) removed to
avoid the number becoming octal after incrementing "009" to "010".

When 'encoding' is set to a Unicode encoding, the value for 'fileencodings'
now includes "default" before "latin1".  This means that for files with 8-bit
encodings the default is to use the encoding specified by the environment, if
possible.  Previously latin1 would always be used, which is wrong in a
non-latin1 environment, such as Russian.

Previously Vim would exit when there are two windows, both of them displaying
a help file, and using ":quit".  Now only the window is closed.

"-w {scriptout}" only works when {scriptout} doesn't start with a digit.
Otherwise it's used to set the 'window' option.

Previously <Home> and <xHome> could be mapped separately.  This had the
disadvantage that all mappings (with modifiers) had to be duplicated, since
you can't be sure what the keyboard generates.  Now all <xHome> are internally
translated to <Home>, both for the keys and for mappings.  Also for <xEnd>,
<xF1>, etc.

":put" now leaves the cursor on the last inserted line.

When a .gvimrc file exists then 'compatible' is off, just like when a ".vimrc"
file exists.

When making a string upper-case with "vlllU" or similar then the German sharp
s is replaced with "SS".  This does not happen with "~" to avoid backwards
compatibility problems and because "SS" can't be changed back to a sharp s.

"gd" previously found the very first occurrence of a variable in a function,
that could be the function argument without type.  Now it finds the position
where the type is given.

The line continuation in functions was not taken into account, line numbers in
errors were logical lines, not lines in the sourced file.  That made it
difficult to locate errors.  Now the line number in the sourced file is
reported, relative to the function start.  This also means that line numbers
for ":breakadd func" are different.

When defining a user command with |:command| the special items could be
abbreviated.  This caused unexpected behavior, such as <li> being recognized
as <line1>.  The items can no longer be abbreviated.

When executing a FileChangedRO autocommand it is no longer allowed to switch
to another buffer or edit another file.  This is to prevent crashes (the event
is triggered deep down in the code where changing buffers is not anticipated).
It is still possible to reload the buffer.

At the |more-prompt| and the |hit-enter-prompt|, when the 'more' option is
set, the 'k', 'u', 'g' and 'b' keys are now used to scroll back to previous
messages.  Thus they are no longer used as typeahead.

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES						*new-7*

Vim script enhancements					*new-vim-script*
-----------------------

In Vim scripts the following types have been added:

	|List|		ordered list of items
	|Dictionary|	associative array of items
	|Funcref|	reference to a function

Many functions and commands have been added to support the new types.

The |string()| function can be used to get a string representation of a
variable.  Works for Numbers, Strings and composites of them.  Then |eval()|
can be used to turn the string back into the variable value.

The |:let| command can now use "+=", "-=" and ".=": >
	:let var += expr	" works like :let var = var + expr
	:let var -= expr	" works like :let var = var - expr
	:let var .= string	" works like :let var = var . string

With the |:profile| command you can find out where your function or script
is wasting time.

In the Python interface vim.eval() also handles Dictionaries and Lists.
|python-eval| (G. Sumner Hayes)

The |getscript| plugin was added as a convenient way to update scripts from
www.vim.org automatically. (Charles Campbell)

The |vimball| plugin was added as a convenient way to distribute a set of
files for a plugin (plugin file, autoload script, documentation). (Charles
Campbell)


Spell checking						*new-spell*
--------------

Spell checking has been integrated in Vim.  There were a few implementations
with scripts, but they were slow and/or required an external program.

The 'spell'	   option is used to switch spell checking on or off
The 'spelllang'    option is used to specify the accepted language(s)
The 'spellfile'    option specifies where new words are added
The 'spellsuggest' option specifies the methods used for making suggestions

The |]s| and |[s| commands can be used to move to the next or previous error
The |zg| and |zw| commands can be used to add good and wrong words
The |z=|	  command can be used to list suggestions and correct the word
The |:mkspell|    command is used to generate a Vim spell file from word lists

The "undercurl" highlighting attribute was added to nicely point out spelling
mistakes in the GUI (based on patch from Marcin Dalecki).
The "guisp" color can be used to give it a color different from foreground and
background.
The number of possible different highlight attributes was raised from about
220 to over 30000.  This allows for the attributes of spelling to be combined
with syntax highlighting attributes.  This is also used for syntax
highlighting and marking the Visual area.

Much more info here: |spell|.


Omni completion					*new-omni-completion*
---------------

This could also be called "intellisense", but that is a trademark.  It is a
smart kind of completion.  The text in front of the cursor is inspected to
figure out what could be following.  This may suggest struct and class
members, system functions, etc.

Use CTRL-X CTRL-O in Insert mode to start the completion.  |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|

The 'omnifunc' option is set by filetype plugins to define the function that
figures out the completion.

Currently supported languages:
	C					|ft-c-omni|
	(X)HTML with CSS			|ft-html-omni|
	JavaScript				|ft-javascript-omni|
	PHP					|ft-php-omni|
	Python
	Ruby					|ft-ruby-omni|
	SQL					|ft-sql-omni|
	XML					|ft-xml-omni|
	any language with syntax highlighting	|ft-syntax-omni|

You can add your own omni completion scripts.

When the 'completeopt' option contains "menu" then matches for Insert mode
completion are displayed in a (rather primitive) popup menu.


MzScheme interface					*new-MzScheme*
------------------

The MzScheme interpreter is supported. |MzScheme|

The |:mzscheme| command can be used to execute MzScheme commands
The |:mzfile|   command can be used to execute an MzScheme script file

This depends on Vim being compiled with the |+mzscheme| feature.


Printing multi-byte text				*new-print-multi-byte*
------------------------

The |:hardcopy| command now supports printing multi-byte characters when using
PostScript.

The 'printmbcharset' and 'printmbfont' options are used for this.
Also see |postscript-cjk-printing|.  (Mike Williams)


Tab pages						*new-tab-pages*
---------

A tab page is a page with one or more windows with a label (aka tab) at the top.
By clicking on the label you can quickly switch between the tab pages.  And
with the keyboard, using the |gt| (Goto Tab) command.  This is a convenient
way to work with many windows.

To start Vim with each file argument in a separate tab page use the |-p|
argument.  The maximum number of pages can be set with 'tabpagemax'.

The line with tab labels is either made with plain text and highlighting or
with a GUI mechanism.  The GUI labels look better but are only available on a
few systems.  The line can be customized with 'tabline', 'guitablabel' and
'guitabtooltip'.  Whether it is displayed is set with 'showtabline'.  Whether
to use the GUI labels is set with the "e" flag in 'guioptions'.

The |:tab| command modifier can be used to have most commands that open a new
window open a new tab page instead.

The |--remote-tab| argument can be used to edit a file in a new tab page in an
already running Vim server.

Variables starting with "t:" are local to a tab page.

More info here: |tabpage|
Most of the GUI stuff was implemented by Yegappan Lakshmanan.


Undo branches						*new-undo-branches*
-------------

Previously there was only one line of undo-redo.  If, after undoing a number
of changes, a new change was made all the undone changes were lost.  This
could lead to accidentally losing work.

Vim now makes an undo branch in this situation.  Thus you can go back to the
text after any change, even if they were undone.  So long as you do not run
into 'undolevels', when undo information is freed up to limit the memory used.

To be able to navigate the undo branches each change is numbered sequentially.
The commands |g-| and |:earlier| go back in time, to older changes.  The
commands |g+| and |:later| go forward in time, to newer changes.

The changes are also timestamped.  Use ":earlier 10m" to go to the text as it
was about ten minutes earlier.

The |:undolist| command can be used to get an idea of which undo branches
exist.  The |:undo| command now takes an argument to directly jump to a
specific position in this list.  The |changenr()| function can be used to
obtain the change number.

There is no graphical display of the tree with changes, navigation can be
quite confusing.


Extended Unicode support				*new-more-unicode*
------------------------

Previously only two combining characters were displayed.  The limit is now
raised to 6.  This can be set with the 'maxcombine' option.  The default is
still 2.

|ga| now shows all combining characters, not just the first two.

Previously only 16 bit Unicode characters were supported for displaying.  Now
the full 32 bit character set can be used.  Unless manually disabled at
compile time to save a bit of memory.

For pattern matching it is now possible to search for individual composing
characters. |patterns-composing|

The |8g8| command searches for an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence.


More highlighting				*new-more-highlighting*
-----------------

Highlighting matching parens:

When moving the cursor through the text and it is on a paren, then the
matching paren can be highlighted.  This uses the new |CursorMoved|
autocommand event.

This means some commands are executed every time you move the cursor.  If this
slows you down too much switch it off with: >
	:NoMatchParen

See |matchparen| for more information.

The plugin uses the |:match| command.  It now supports three match patterns.
The plugin uses the third one.  The first one is for the user and the second
one can be used by another plugin.

Highlighting the cursor line and column:

The 'cursorline' and 'cursorcolumn' options have been added.  These highlight
the screen line and screen column of the cursor.  This makes the cursor
position easier to spot.  'cursorcolumn' is also useful to align text.  This
may make screen updating quite slow.  The CursorColumn and CursorLine
highlight groups allow changing the colors used.  |hl-CursorColumn|
|hl-CursorLine|

The number of possible different highlight attributes was raised from about
220 to over 30000.  This allows for the attributes of spelling to be combined
with syntax highlighting attributes.  This is also used for syntax
highlighting, marking the Visual area, CursorColumn, etc.


Translated manual pages					*new-manpage-trans*
-----------------------

The manual page of Vim and associated programs is now also available in
several other languages.

French  - translated by David Blanchet
Italian - translated by Antonio Colombo
Russian - translated by Vassily Ragosin
Polish  - translated by Mikolaj Machowski

The Unix Makefile installs the Italian manual pages in .../man/it/man1/,
.../man/it.ISO8859-1/man1/ and .../man/it.UTF-8/man1/.  There appears to be no
standard for what encoding goes in the "it" directory, the 8-bit encoded file
is used there as a best guess.
Other languages are installed in similar places.
The translated pages are not automatically installed when Vim was configured
with "--disable-nls", but "make install-languages install-tool-languages" will
do it anyway.


Internal grep						*new-vimgrep*
-------------

The ":vimgrep" command can be used to search for a pattern in a list of files.
This is like the ":grep" command, but no external program is used.  Besides
better portability, handling of different file encodings and using multi-line
patterns, this also allows grepping in compressed and remote files.
|:vimgrep|.

If you want to use the search results in a script you can use the
|getqflist()| function.

To grep files in various directories the "**" pattern can be used.  It expands
into an arbitrary depth of directories.  "**" can be used in all places where
file names are expanded, thus also with |:next| and |:args|.


Scroll back in messages					*new-scroll-back*
-----------------------

When displaying messages, at the |more-prompt| and the |hit-enter-prompt|, The
'k', 'u', 'g' and 'b' keys can be used to scroll back to previous messages.
This is especially useful for commands such as ":syntax", ":autocommand" and
":highlight".  This is implemented in a generic way thus it works for all
commands and highlighting is kept.  Only works when the 'more' option is set.
Previously it only partly worked for ":clist".

The |g<| command can be used to see the last page of messages after you have
hit <Enter> at the |hit-enter-prompt|.  Then you can scroll further back.


Cursor past end of the line				*new-onemore*
---------------------------

When the 'virtualedit' option contains "onemore" the cursor can move just past
the end of the line.  As if it's on top of the line break.

This makes some commands more consistent.  Previously the cursor was always
past the end of the line if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi
compatible.  It may also break some plugins or Vim scripts.  Use with care!

The patch was provided by Mattias Flodin.


POSIX compatibility					*new-posix*
-------------------

The POSIX test suite was used to verify POSIX compatibility.  A number of
problems have been fixed to make Vim more POSIX compatible.  Some of them
conflict with traditional Vi or expected behavior.  The $VIM_POSIX environment
variable can be set to get POSIX compatibility.  See |posix|.

Items that were fixed for both Vi and POSIX compatibility:
- repeating "R" with a count only overwrites text once; added the 'X' flag to
  'cpoptions' |cpo-X|
- a vertical movement command that moves to a non-existing line fails; added
  the '-' flag to 'cpoptions' |cpo--|
- when preserving a file and doing ":q!" the file can be recovered; added the
  '&' flag to 'cpoptions' |cpo-&|
- The 'window' option is partly implemented.  It specifies how much CTRL-F and
  CTRL-B scroll when there is one window.  The "-w {number}" argument is now
  accepted.  "-w {scriptout}" only works when {scriptout} doesn't start with a
  digit.
- Allow "-c{command}" argument, no space between "-c" and {command}.
- When writing a file with ":w!" don't reset 'readonly' when 'Z' is present in
  'cpoptions'.
- Allow 'l' and '#' flags for ":list", ":print" and ":number".
- Added the '.' flag to 'cpoptions': ":cd" fails when the buffer is modified.
- In Ex mode with an empty buffer ":read file" doesn't keep an empty line
  above or below the new lines.
- Remove a backslash before a NL for the ":global" command.
- When ":append", ":insert" or ":change" is used with ":global", get the
  inserted lines from the command.  Can use backslash-NL to separate lines.
- Can use ":global /pat/ visual" to execute Normal mode commands at each
  matched line.  Use "Q" to continue and go to the next line.
- The |:open| command has been partially implemented.  It stops Ex mode, but
  redraws the whole screen, not just one line as open mode is supposed to do.
- Support using a pipe to read the output from and write input to an external
  command.  Added the 'shelltemp' option and has("filterpipe").
- In ex silent mode the ":set" command output is displayed.
- The ":@@" and ":**" give an error message when no register was used before.
- The search pattern "[]-`]" matches ']', '^', '_' and '`'.
- Autoindent for ":insert" is using the line below the insert.
- Autoindent for ":change" is using the first changed line.
- Editing Ex command lines is not done in cooked mode, because CTRL-D and
  CTRL-T cannot be handled then.
- In Ex mode, "1,3" prints three lines.  "%" prints all lines.
- In Ex mode "undo" would undo all changes since Ex mode was started.
- Implemented the 'prompt' option.


Debugger support					*new-debug-support*
----------------

The 'balloonexpr' option has been added.  This is a generic way to implement
balloon functionality.  You can use it to show info for the word under the
mouse pointer.


Remote file explorer					*new-netrw-explore*
--------------------

The netrw plugin now also supports viewing a directory, when "scp://" is used.
Deleting and renaming files is possible.

To avoid duplicating a lot of code, the previous file explorer plugin has been
integrated in the netrw plugin.  This means browsing local and remote files
works the same way.

":browse edit" and ":browse split" use the netrw plugin when it's available
and a GUI dialog is not possible.

The netrw plugin is maintained by Charles Campbell.


Define an operator					*new-define-operator*
------------------

Previously it was not possible to define your own operator; a command that is
followed by a {motion}.  Vim 7 introduces the 'operatorfunc' option and the
|g@| operator.  This makes it possible to define a mapping that works like an
operator.  The actual work is then done by a function, which is invoked
through the |g@| operator.

See |:map-operator| for the explanation and an example.


Mapping to an expression				*new-map-expression*
------------------------

The {rhs} argument of a mapping can be an expression.  That means the
resulting characters can depend on the context.  Example: >
	:inoremap <expr> . InsertDot()
Here the dot will be mapped to whatever InsertDot() returns.

This also works for abbreviations.  See |:map-<expr>| for the details.


Visual and Select mode mappings				*new-map-select*
-------------------------------

Previously Visual mode mappings applied both to Visual and Select mode.  With
a trick to have the mappings work in Select mode like they would in Visual
mode.

Commands have been added to define mappings for Visual and Select mode
separately: |:xmap| and |:smap|.  With the associated "noremap" and "unmap"
commands.

The same is done for menus: |:xmenu|, |:smenu|, etc.


Location list						*new-location-list*
-------------

The support for a per-window quickfix list (location list) is added. The
location list can be displayed in a location window (similar to the quickfix
window).  You can open more than one location list window.  A set of commands
similar to the quickfix commands are added to browse the location list.
(Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Greek in cp737 (Panagiotis Louridas)
Polish-slash (HS6_06)
Ukrainian-jcuken (Anatoli Sakhnik)
Kana (Edward L. Fox)


New message translations: ~

The Ukrainian messages are now also available in cp1251.
Vietnamese message translations and menu. (Phan Vinh Thinh)


Others: ~

The |:read| command has the |++edit| argument.  This means it will use the
detected 'fileformat', 'fileencoding' and other options for the buffer.  This
also fixes the problem that editing a compressed file didn't set these
options.

The Netbeans interface was updated for Sun Studio 10.  The protocol number
goes from 2.2 to 2.3. (Gordon Prieur)

Mac: When starting up Vim will load the $VIMRUNTIME/macmap.vim script to
define default command-key mappings. (mostly by Benji Fisher)

Mac: Add the selection type to the clipboard, so that Block, line and
character selections can be used between two Vims. (Eckehard Berns)
Also fixes the problem that setting 'clipboard' to "unnamed" breaks using
"yyp".

Mac: GUI font selector. (Peter Cucka)

Mac: support for multi-byte characters. (Da Woon Jung)
This doesn't always work properly.  If you see text drawing problems try
switching the 'macatsui' option off.

Mac: Support the xterm mouse in the non-GUI version.

Mac: better integration with Xcode.  Post a fake mouse-up event after the odoc
event and the drag receive handler to work around a stall after Vim loads a
file.  Fixed an off-by-one line number error. (Da Woon Jung)

Mac: When started from Finder change directory to the file being edited or the
user home directory.

Added the t_SI and t_EI escape sequences for starting and ending Insert mode.
To be used to set the cursor shape to a bar or a block.  No default values,
they are not supported by termcap/terminfo.

GUI font selector for Motif. (Marcin Dalecki)

Nicer toolbar buttons for Motif. (Marcin Dalecki)

Mnemonics for the Motif find/replace dialog. (Marcin Dalecki)

Included a few improvements for Motif from Marcin Dalecki.  Draw label
contents ourselves to make them handle fonts in a way configurable by Vim and
a bit less dependent on the X11 font management.

Autocommands can be defined local to a buffer.  This means they will also work
when the buffer does not have a name or no specific name.  See
|autocmd-buflocal|.  (Yakov Lerner)

For xterm most combinations of modifiers with function keys are recognized.
|xterm-modifier-keys|

When 'verbose' is set the output of ":highlight" will show where a highlight
item was last set.
When 'verbose' is set the output of the ":map", ":abbreviate", ":command",
":function" and ":autocmd" commands will show where it was last defined.
(Yegappan Lakshmanan)

":function /pattern" lists functions matching the pattern.

"1gd" can be used like "gd" but ignores matches in a {} block that ends before
the cursor position.  Likewise for "1gD" and "gD".

'scrolljump' can be set to a negative number to scroll a percentage of the
window height.

The |v:scrollstart| variable has been added to help find the location in
your script that causes the hit-enter prompt.

To make it possible to handle the situation that a file is being edited that
is already being edited by another Vim instance, the |SwapExists| event has
been added.  The |v:swapname|, |v:swapchoice| and |v:swapcommand| variables
can be used, for example to use the |client-server| functionality to bring the
other Vim to the foreground.
When starting Vim with a "-t tag" argument, there is an existing swapfile and
the user selects "quit" or "abort" then exit Vim.

Undo now also restores the '< and '> marks.  "gv" selects the same area as
before the change and undo.

When editing a search pattern for a "/" or "?" command and 'incsearch' is set
CTRL-L can be used to add a character from the current match.  CTRL-R CTRL-W
will add a word, but exclude the part of the word that was already typed.

Ruby interface: add line number methods. (Ryan Paul)

The $MYVIMRC environment variable is set to the first found vimrc file.
The $MYGVIMRC environment variable is set to the first found gvimrc file.

==============================================================================
IMPROVEMENTS						*improvements-7*

":helpgrep" accepts a language specifier after the pattern: "pat@it".

Moved the help for printing to a separate help file.  It's quite a lot now.

When doing completion for ":!cmd", ":r !cmd" or ":w !cmd" executable files are
found in $PATH instead of looking for ordinary files in the current directory.

When ":silent" is used and a backwards range is given for an Ex command the
range is swapped automatically instead of asking if that is OK.

The pattern matching code was changed from a recursive function to an
iterative mechanism.  This avoids out-of-stack errors.  State is stored in
allocated memory, running out of memory can always be detected.  Allows
matching more complex things, but Vim may seem to hang while doing that.

Previously some options were always evaluated in the |sandbox|.  Now that only
happens when the option was set from a modeline or in secure mode.  Applies to
'balloonexpr', 'foldexpr', 'foldtext' and 'includeexpr'. (Sumner Hayes)

Some commands and expressions could have nasty side effects, such as using
CTRL-R = while editing a search pattern and the expression invokes a function
that jumps to another window.  The |textlock| has been added to prevent this
from happening.

":breakadd here" and ":breakdel here" can be used to set or delete a
breakpoint at the cursor.

It is now possible to define a function with: >
	:exe "func Test()\n ...\n endfunc"

The tutor was updated to make it simpler to use and text was added to explain
a few more important commands.  Used ideas from Gabriel Zachmann.

Unix: When libcall() fails obtain an error message with dlerror() and display
it. (Johannes Zellner)

Mac and Cygwin: When editing an existing file make the file name the same case
of the edited file.  Thus when typing ":e os_UNIX.c" the file name becomes
"os_unix.c".

Added "nbsp" in 'listchars'. (David Blanchet)

Added the "acwrite" value for the 'buftype' option.  This is for a buffer that
does not have a name that refers to a file and is written with BufWriteCmd
autocommands.

For lisp indenting and matching parenthesis: (Sergey Khorev)
- square brackets are recognized properly
- #\(, #\), #\[ and #\] are recognized as character literals
- Lisp line comments (delimited by semicolon) are recognized

Added the "count" argument to match(), matchend() and matchstr(). (Ilya Sher)

winnr() takes an optional "$" or "#" argument.  (Nikolai Weibull, Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

Added 's' flag to search(): set ' mark if cursor moved. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
Added 'n' flag to search(): don't move the cursor. (Nikolai Weibull)
Added 'c' flag to search(): accept match at the cursor.
Added 'e' flag to search(): move to end of the match. (Benji Fisher)
Added 'p' flag to search(): return number of sub-pattern. (Benji Fisher)
These also apply to searchpos(), searchpair() and searchpairpos().

The search() and searchpair() functions have an extra argument to specify
where to stop searching.  Speeds up searches that should not continue too far.

When uncompressing fails in the gzip plugin, give an error message but don't
delete the raw text.  Helps if the file has a .gz extension but is not
actually compressed. (Andrew Pimlott)

When C, C++ or IDL syntax is used, may additionally load doxygen syntax.
(Michael Geddes)

Support setting 'filetype' and 'syntax' to "aaa.bbb" for "aaa" plus "bbb"
filetype or syntax.

The ":registers" command now displays multi-byte characters properly.

VMS: In the usage message mention that a slash can be used to make a flag
upper case.  Add color support to the builtin vt320 terminal codes.
(Zoltan Arpadffy)

For the '%' item in 'viminfo', allow a number to set a maximum for the number
of buffers.

For recognizing the file type: When a file looks like a shell script, check
for an "exec" command that starts the tcl interpreter. (suggested by Alexios
Zavras)

Support conversion between utf-8 and latin9 (iso-8859-15) internally, so that
digraphs still work when iconv is not available.

When a session file is loaded while editing an unnamed, empty buffer that
buffer is wiped out.  Avoids that there is an unused buffer in the buffer
list.

Win32: When libintl.dll supports bind_textdomain_codeset(), use it.
(NAKADAIRA Yukihiro)

Win32: Vim was not aware of hard links on NTFS file systems.  These are
detected now for when 'backupcopy' is "auto".  Also fixed a bogus "file has
been changed since reading it" error for links.

When foldtext() finds no text after removing the comment leader, use the
second line of the fold.  Helps for C-style /* */ comments where the first
line is just "/*".

When editing the same file from two systems (e.g., Unix and MS-Windows) there
mostly was no warning for an existing swap file, because the name of the
edited file differs (e.g., y:\dir\file vs /home/me/dir/file).  Added a flag to
the swap file to indicate it is in the same directory as the edited file.  The
used path then doesn't matter and the check for editing the same file is much
more reliable.

Unix: When editing a file through a symlink the swap file would use the name
of the symlink.  Now use the name of the actual file, so that editing the same
file twice is detected. (suggestions by Stefano Zacchiroli and James Vega)

Client-server communication now supports 'encoding'.  When setting 'encoding'
in a Vim server to "utf-8", and using "vim --remote fname" in a console,
"fname" is converted from the console encoding to utf-8.  Also allows Vims
with different 'encoding' settings to exchange messages.

Internal: Changed ga_room into ga_maxlen, so that it doesn't need to be
incremented/decremented each time.

When a register is empty it is not stored in the viminfo file.

Removed the tcltags script, it's obsolete.

":redir @*>>" and ":redir @+>>" append to the clipboard.  Better check for
invalid characters after the register name. |:redir|

":redir => variable" and ":redir =>> variable" write or append to a variable.
(Yegappan Lakshmanan) |:redir|

":redir @{a-z}>>" appends to register a to z. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

The 'verbosefile' option can be used to log messages in a file.  Verbose
messages are not displayed then.  The "-V{filename}" argument can be used to
log startup messages.

":let g:" lists global variables.
":let b:" lists buffer-local variables.
":let w:" lists window-local variables.
":let v:" lists Vim variables.

The stridx() and strridx() functions take a third argument, where to start
searching.  (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

The getreg() function takes an extra argument to be able to get the expression
for the '=' register instead of the result of evaluating it.

The setline() function can take a List argument to set multiple lines.  When
the line number is just below the last line the line is appended.

g CTRL-G also shows the number of characters if it differs from the number of
bytes.

Completion for ":debug" and entering an expression for the '=' register.  Skip
":" between range and command name. (Peter winters)

CTRL-Q in Insert mode now works like CTRL-V by default.  Previously it was
ignored.

When "beep" is included in 'debug' a function or script that causes a beep
will result in a message with the source of the error.

When completing buffer names, match with "\(^\|[\/]\)" instead of "^", so that
":buf stor<Tab>" finds both "include/storage.h" and "storage/main.c".

To count items (pattern matches) without changing the buffer the 'n' flag has
been added to |:substitute|.  See |count-items|.

In a |:substitute| command the \u, \U, \l and \L items now also work for
multi-byte characters.

The "screen.linux" $TERM name is recognized to set the default for
'background' to "dark". (Ciaran McCreesh)  Also for "cygwin" and "putty".

The |FileChangedShell| autocommand event can now use the |v:fcs_reason|
variable that specifies what triggered the event.  |v:fcs_choice| can be used
to reload the buffer or ask the user what to do.

Not all modifiers were recognized for xterm function keys.  Added the
possibility in term codes to end in ";*X" or "O*X", where X is any character
and the * stands for the modifier code.
Added the <xUp>, <xDown>, <xLeft> and <xRight> keys, to be able to recognize
the two forms that xterm can send their codes in and still handle all possible
modifiers.

getwinvar() now also works to obtain a buffer-local option from the specified
window.

Added the "%s" item to 'errorformat'. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
Added the "%>" item to 'errorformat'.

For 'errorformat' it was not possible to have a file name that contains the
character that follows after "%f".  For example, in "%f:%l:%m" the file name
could not contain ":".  Now include the first ":" where the rest of the
pattern matches.  In the example a ":" not followed by a line number is
included in the file name. (suggested by Emanuele Giaquinta)

GTK GUI: use the GTK file dialog when it's available.  Mix from patches by
Grahame Bowland and Evan Webb.

Added ":scriptnames" to bugreport.vim, so that we can see what plugins were
used.

Win32: If the user changes the setting for the number of lines a scroll wheel
click scrolls it is now used immediately.  Previously Vim would need to be
restarted.

When using @= in an expression the value is expression @= contains.  ":let @=
= value" can be used to set the register contents.

A ! can be added to ":popup" to have the popup menu appear at the mouse
pointer position instead of the text cursor.

The table with encodings has been expanded with many MS-Windows codepages,
such as cp1250 and cp737, so that these can also be used on Unix without
prepending "8bit-".
When an encoding name starts with "microsoft-cp" ignore the "microsoft-" part.

Added the "customlist" completion argument to a user-defined command.  The
user-defined completion function should return the completion candidates as a
Vim List and the returned results are not filtered by Vim. (Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

Win32: Balloons can have multiple lines if common controls supports it.
(Sergey Khorev)

For command-line completion the matches for various types of arguments are now
sorted: user commands, variables, syntax names, etc.

When no locale is set, thus using the "C" locale, Vim will work with latin1
characters, using its own isupper()/toupper()/etc. functions.

When using an rxvt terminal emulator guess the value of 'background' using the
COLORFGBG environment variable. (Ciaran McCreesh)

Also support t_SI and t_EI on Unix with normal features. (Ciaran McCreesh)

When 'foldcolumn' is one then put as much info in it as possible.  This allows
closing a fold with the mouse by clicking on the '-'.

input() takes an optional completion argument to specify the type of
completion supported for the input. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

"dp" works with more than two buffers in diff mode if there is only one where
'modifiable' is set.

The 'diffopt' option has three new values: "horizontal", "vertical" and
"foldcolumn".

When the 'include' option contains \zs the file name found is what is being
matched from \zs to the end or \ze.  Useful to pass more to 'includeexpr'.

Loading plugins on startup now supports subdirectories in the plugin
directory. |load-plugins|

In the foldcolumn always show the '+' for a closed fold, so that it can be
opened easily.  It may overwrite another character, esp. if 'foldcolumn' is 1.

It is now possible to get the W10 message again by setting 'readonly'.  Useful
in the FileChangedRO autocommand when checking out the file fails.

Unix: When open() returns EFBIG give an appropriate message.

":mksession" sets the SessionLoad variable to notify plugins.  A modeline is
added to the session file to set 'filetype' to "vim".

In the ATTENTION prompt put the "Delete it" choice before "Quit" to make it
more logical.  (Robert Webb)

When appending to a file while the buffer has no name the name of the appended
file would be used for the current buffer.  But the buffer contents is
actually different from the file content.  Don't set the file name, unless the
'P' flag is present in 'cpoptions'.

When starting to edit a new file and the directory for the file doesn't exist
then Vim will report "[New DIRECTORY]" instead of "[New File] to give the user
a hint that something might be wrong.

Win32: Preserve the hidden attribute of the viminfo file.

In Insert mode CTRL-A didn't keep the last inserted text when using CTRL-O and
then a cursor key.  Now keep the previously inserted text if nothing is
inserted after the CTRL-O.  Allows using CTRL-O commands to move the cursor
without losing the last inserted text.

The exists() function now supports checking for autocmd group definition
and for supported autocommand events. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Allow using ":global" in the sandbox, it doesn't do anything harmful by
itself.

":saveas asdf.c" will set 'filetype' to c when it's empty.  Also for ":w
asdf.c" when it sets the filename for the buffer.

Insert mode completion for whole lines now also searches unloaded buffers.

The colortest.vim script can now be invoked directly with ":source" or
":runtime syntax/colortest.vim".

The 'statusline' option can be local to the window, so that each window can
have a different value.  (partly by Yegappan Lakshmanan)

The 'statusline' option and other options that support the same format can now
use these new features:
- When it starts with "%!" the value is first evaluated as an expression
  before parsing the value.
- "%#HLname#" can be used to start highlighting with HLname.

When 'statusline' is set to something that causes an error message then it is
made empty to avoid an endless redraw loop.  Also for other options, such at
'tabline' and 'titlestring'.  ":verbose set statusline" will mention that it
was set in an error handler.

When there are several matching tags, the ":tag <name>" and CTRL-] commands
jump to the [count] matching tag. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Win32: In the batch files generated by the install program, use $VIMRUNTIME or
$VIM if it's set.  Example provided by Mathias Michaelis.
Also create a vimtutor.bat batch file.

The 'balloonexpr' option is now |global-local|.

The system() function now runs in cooked mode, thus can be interrupted by
CTRL-C.

==============================================================================
COMPILE TIME CHANGES					*compile-changes-7*

Dropped the support for the BeOS and Amiga GUI.  They were not maintained and
probably didn't work.  If you want to work on this: get the Vim 6.x version
and merge it back in.

When running the tests and one of them fails to produce "test.out" the
following tests are still executed.  This helps when running out of memory.

When compiling with EXITFREE defined and the ccmalloc library it is possible
to detect memory leaks.  Some memory will always reported as leaked, such as
allocated by X11 library functions and the memory allocated in alloc_cmdbuff()
to store the ":quit" command.

Moved the code for printing to src/hardcopy.c.

Moved some code from main() to separate functions to make it easier to see
what is being done.  Using a structure to avoid a lot of arguments to the
functions.

Moved unix_expandpath() to misc1.c, so that it can also be used by os_mac.c
without copying the code.

--- Mac ---

"make" now creates the Vim.app directory and "make install" copies it to its
final destination. (Raf)

Put the runtime directory not directly in Vim.app but in
Vim.app/Contents/Resources/vim, so that it's according to Mac specs.

Made it possible to compile with Motif, Athena or GTK without tricks and still
being able to use the MacRoman conversion.  Added the os_mac_conv.c file.

When running "make install" the runtime files are installed as for Unix.
Avoids that too many files are copied.  When running "make" a link to the
runtime files is created to avoid a recursive copy that takes much time.

Configure will attempt to build Vim for both Intel and PowerPC.  The
--with-mac-arch configure argument can change it.

--- Win32 ---

The Make_mvc.mak file was adjusted to work with the latest MS compilers,
including the free version of Visual Studio 2005. (George Reilly)

INSTALLpc.txt was updated for the recent changes. (George Reilly)

The distributed executable is now produced with the free Visual C++ Toolkit
2003 and other free SDK chunks.  msvcsetup.bat was added to support this.

Also generate the .pdb file that can be used to generate a useful crash report
on MS-Windows. (George Reilly)

==============================================================================
BUG FIXES						*bug-fixes-7*

When using PostScript printing on MS-DOS the default 'printexpr' used "lpr"
instead of "copy".  When 'printdevice' was empty the copy command did not
work.  Use "LPT1" then.

The GTK font dialog uses a font size zero when the font name doesn't include a
size.  Use a default size of 10.

This example in the documentation didn't work:
    :e `=foo . ".c"`
Skip over the expression in `=expr` when looking for comments, |, % and #.

When ":helpgrep" doesn't find anything there is no error message.

"L" and "H" did not take closed folds into account.

Win32: The "-P title" argument stopped at the first title that matched, even
when it doesn't support MDI.

Mac GUI: CTRL-^ and CTRL-@ did not work.

"2daw" on "word." at the end of a line didn't include the preceding white
space.

Win32: Using FindExecutable() doesn't work to find a program.  Use
SearchPath() instead.  For executable() use $PATHEXT when the program searched
for doesn't have an extension.

When 'virtualedit' is set, moving the cursor up after appending a character
may move it to a different column.  Was caused by auto-formatting moving the
cursor and not putting it back where it was.

When indent was added automatically and then moving the cursor, the indent was
not deleted (like when pressing ESC).  The "I" flag in 'cpoptions' can be used
to make it work the old way.

When opening a command-line window, 'textwidth' gets set to 78 by the Vim
filetype plugin.  Reset 'textwidth' to 0 to avoid lines are broken.

After using cursor(line, col) moving up/down doesn't keep the same column.

Win32: Borland C before 5.5 requires using ".u." for LowPart and HighPart
fields. (Walter Briscoe)

On Sinix SYS_NMLN isn't always defined.  Define it ourselves. (Cristiano De
Michele)

Printing with PostScript may keep the printer waiting for more.  Append a
CTRL-D to the printer output. (Mike Williams)

When converting a string with a hex or octal number the leading '-' was
ignored.  ":echo '-05' + 0" resulted in 5 instead of -5.

Using "@:" to repeat a command line didn't work when it contains control
characters.  Also remove "'<,'>" when in Visual mode to avoid that it appears
twice.

When using file completion for a user command, it would not expand environment
variables like for a regular command with a file argument.

'cindent': When the argument of a #define looks like a C++ class the next line
is indented too much.

When 'comments' includes multi-byte characters inserting the middle part and
alignment may go wrong.  'cindent' also suffers from this for right-aligned
items.

Win32: when 'encoding' is set to "utf-8" getenv() still returns strings in the
active codepage.  Convert to utf-8.  Also for $HOME.

The default for 'helplang' was "zh" for both "zh_cn" and "zh_tw".  Now use
"cn" or "tw" as intended.

When 'bin' is set and 'eol' is not set then line2byte() added the line break
after the last line while it's not there.

Using foldlevel() in a WinEnter autocommand may not work.  Noticed when
resizing the GUI shell upon startup.

Python: Using buffer.append(f.readlines()) didn't work.  Allow appending a
string with a trailing newline.  The newline is ignored.

When using the ":saveas f2" command for buffer "f1", the Buffers menu would
contain "f2" twice, one of them leading to "f1".  Also trigger the BufFilePre
and BufFilePost events for the alternate buffer that gets the old name.

strridx() did not work well when the needle is empty. (Ciaran McCreesh)

GTK: Avoid a potential hang in gui_mch_wait_for_chars() when input arrives
just before it is invoked

VMS: Occasionally CR characters were inserted in the file.  Expansion of
environment variables was not correct. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

UTF-8: When 'delcombine' is set "dw" only deleted the last combining character
from the first character of the word.

When using ":sball" in an autocommand only the filetype in one buffer was
detected.  Reset did_filetype in enter_buffer().

When using ":argdo" and the window already was at the first argument index,
but not actually editing it, the current buffer would be used instead.

When ":next dir/*" includes many matches, adding the names to the argument
list may take an awful lot of time and can't be interrupted.  Allow
interrupting this.

When editing a file that was already loaded in a buffer, modelines were not
used.  Now window-local options in the modeline are set.  Buffer-local options
and global options remain unmodified.

Win32: When 'encoding' is set to "utf-8" in the vimrc file, files from the
command line with non-ASCII characters are not used correctly.  Recode the
file names when 'encoding' is set, using the Unicode command line.

Win32 console: When the default for 'encoding' ends up to be "latin1", the
default value of 'isprint' was wrong.

When an error message is given while waiting for a character (e.g., when an
xterm reports the number of colors), the hit-enter prompt overwrote the last
line.  Don't reset msg_didout in normal_cmd() for K_IGNORE.

Mac GUI: Shift-Tab didn't work.

When defining tooltip text, don't translate terminal codes, since it's not
going to be used like a command.

GTK 2: Check the tooltip text for valid utf-8 characters to avoid getting a
GTK error.  Invalid characters may appear when 'encoding' is changed.

GTK 2: Add a safety check for invalid utf-8 sequences, they can crash pango.

Win32: When 'encoding' is changed while starting up, use the Unicode command
line to convert the file arguments to 'encoding'.  Both for the GUI and the
console version.

Win32 GUI: latin9 text (iso-8859-15) was not displayed correctly, because
there is no codepage for latin9.  Do our own conversion from latin9 to UCS2.

When two versions of GTK+ 2 are installed it was possible to use the header
files from one and the library from the other.  Use GTK_LIBDIR to put the
directory for the library early in the link flags.

With the GUI find/replace dialog a replace only worked if the pattern was
literal text.  Now it works for any pattern.

When 'equalalways' is set and 'eadirection' is "hor", ":quit" would still
cause equalizing window heights in the vertical direction.

When ":emenu" is used in a startup script the command was put in the typeahead
buffer, causing a prompt for the crypt key to be messed up.

Mac OS/X: The default for 'isprint' included characters 128-160, causes
problems for Terminal.app.

When a syntax item with "containedin" is used, it may match in the start or
end of a region with a matchgroup, while this doesn't happen for a "contains"
argument.

When a transparent syntax items matches in another item where the highlighting
has already stopped (because of a he= argument), the highlighting would come
back.

When cscope is used to set the quickfix error list, it didn't get set if there
was only one match. (Sergey Khorev)

When 'confirm' is set and using ":bdel" in a modified buffer, then selecting
"cancel", would still give an error message.

The PopUp menu items that started Visual mode didn't work when not in Normal
mode.  Switching between selecting a word and a line was not possible.

Win32: The keypad decimal point always resulted in a '.', while on some
keyboards it's a ','.  Use MapVirtualKey(VK_DECIMAL, 2).

Removed unused function DisplayCompStringOpaque() from gui_w32.c

In Visual mode there is not always an indication whether the line break is
selected or not.  Highlight the character after the line when the line break
is included, e.g., after "v$o".

GTK: The <F10> key can't be mapped, it selects the menu.  Disable that with a
GTK setting and do select the menu when <F10> isn't mapped. (David Necas)

After "Y" '[ and '] were not at start/end of the yanked text.

When a telnet connection is dropped Vim preserves files and exits.  While
doing that a SIGHUP may arrive and disturb us, thus ignore it. (Scott
Anderson)  Also postpone SIGHUP, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM until it's safe to
handle.  Added handle_signal().

When completing a file name on the command line backslashes are required for
white space.  Was only done for a space, not for a Tab.

When configure could not find a terminal library, compiling continued for a
long time before reporting the problem.  Added a configure check for tgetent()
being found in a library.

When the cursor is on the first char of the last line a ":g/pat/s///" command
may cause the cursor to be displayed below the text.

Win32: Editing a file with non-ASCII characters doesn't work when 'encoding'
is "utf-8".  use _wfullpath() instead of _fullpath(). (Yu-sung Moon)

When recovering the 'fileformat' and 'fileencoding' were taken from the
original file instead of from the swapfile.  When the file didn't exist, was
empty or the option was changed (e.g., with ":e ++fenc=cp123 file") it could
be wrong.  Now store 'fileformat' and 'fileencoding' in the swapfile and use
the values when recovering.

":bufdo g/something/p" overwrites each last printed text line with the file
message for the next buffer.  Temporarily clear 'shortmess' to avoid that.

Win32: Cannot edit a file starting with # with --remote.  Do escape % and #
when building the ":drop" command.

A comment or | just after an expression-backtick argument was not recognized.
E.g. in :e `="foo"`"comment.

"(" does not stop at an empty sentence (single dot and white space) while ")"
does.  Also breaks "das" on that dot.

When doing "yy" with the cursor on a TAB the ruler could be wrong and "k"
moved the cursor to another column.

When 'commentstring' is '"%s' and there is a double quote in the line a double
quote before the fold marker isn't removed in the text displayed for a  closed
fold.

In Visual mode, when 'bin' and 'eol' set, g CTRL-G counted the last line
break, resulting in "selected 202 of 201 bytes".

Motif: fonts were not used for dialog components. (Marcin Dalecki)

Motif: After using a toolbar button the keyboard focus would be on the toolbar
(Lesstif problem). (Marcin Dalecki)

When using "y<C-V>`x" where mark x is in the first column, the last line was
not included.

Not all test scripts work properly on MS-Windows when checked out from CVS.
Use a Vim command to fix all fileformats to dos before executing the tests.

When using ":new" and the file fits in the window, lines could still be above
the window.  Now remove empty lines instead of keeping the relative position.

Cmdline completion didn't work after ":let var1 var<Tab>".

When using ":startinsert" or ":startreplace" when already in Insert mode
(possible when using CTRL-R =), pressing Esc would directly restart Insert
mode. (Peter Winters)

"2daw" didn't work at end of file if the last word is a single character.

Completion for ":next a'<Tab>" put a backslash before single quote, but it was
not removed when editing a file.  Now halve backslashes in save_patterns().
Also fix expanding a file name with the shell that contains "\'".

When doing "1,6d|put" only "fewer lines" was reported.  Now a following "more
lines" overwrites the message.

Configure could not handle "-Dfoo=long\ long" in the TCL config output.

When searching backwards, using a pattern that matches a newline and uses \zs
after that, didn't find a match.  Could also get a hang or end up in the right
column in the wrong line.

When $LANG is "sl" for slovenian, the slovak menu was used, since "slovak"
starts with "sl".

When 'paste' is set in the GUI the Paste toolbar button doesn't work.  Clear
'paste' when starting the GUI.

A message about a wrong viminfo line included the trailing NL.

When 'paste' is set in the GUI the toolbar button doesn't work in Insert mode.
Use ":exe" in menu.vim to avoid duplicating the commands, instead of using a
mapping.

Treat "mlterm" as an xterm-like terminal. (Seiichi Sato)

":z.4" and ":z=4" didn't work Vi compatible.

When sourcing a file, editing it and sourcing it again, it could appear twice
in ":scriptnames" and get a new <SID>, because the inode has changed.

When $SHELL is set but empty the 'shell' option would be empty.  Don't use an
empty $SHELL value.

A command "w! file" in .vimrc or $EXINIT didn't work.  Now it writes an empty
file.

When a CTRL-F command at the end of the file failed, the cursor was still
moved to the start of the line.  Now it remains where it is.

When using ":s" or "&" to repeat the last substitute and "$" was used to put
the cursor in the last column, put the cursor in the last column again.  This
is Vi compatible.

Vim is not fully POSIX compliant but sticks with traditional Vi behavior.
Added a few flags in 'cpoptions' to behave the POSIX way when wanted.  The
$VIM_POSIX environment variable is checked to set the default.

Appending to a register didn't insert a line break like Vi.  Added the '>'
flag to 'cpoptions' for this.

Using "I" in a line with only blanks appended to the line.  This is not Vi
compatible.  Added the 'H' flag in 'coptions' for this.

When joining multiple lines the cursor would be at the last joint, but Vi
leaves it at the position where "J" would put it.  Added the 'q' flag in
'cpoptions' for this.

Autoindent didn't work for ":insert" and ":append".

Using ":append" in an empty buffer kept the dummy line.  Now it's deleted to
be Vi compatible.

When reading commands from a file and stdout goes to a terminal, would still
request the xterm version.  Vim can't read it, thus the output went to the
shell and caused trouble there.

When redirecting to a register with an invalid name the redirection would
still be done (after an error message).  Now reset "redir_reg". (Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

It was not possible to use a NL after a backslash in Ex mode.  This is
sometimes used to feed multiple lines to a shell command.

When 'cmdheight' is set to 2 in .vimrc and the GUI uses the number of lines
from the terminal we actually get 3 lines for the cmdline in gvim.

When setting $HOME allocated memory would leak.

Win32: bold characters may sometimes write in another character cell.  Use
unicodepdy[] as for UTF-8. (Taro Muraoka)

":w fname" didn't work for files with 'buftype' set to "nofile".

The method used to locate user commands for completion differed from when they
are executed.  Ambiguous command names were not completed properly.

Incremental search may cause a crash when there is a custom statusline that
indirectly invokes ":normal".

Diff mode failed when $DIFF_OPTIONS was set in the environment.  Unset it
before invoking "diff".

Completion didn't work after ":argdo", ":windo" and ":bufdo".  Also for ":set
&l:opt" and ":set &g:opt". (Peter Winters)

When setting 'ttymouse' to "dec" in an xterm that supports the DEC mouse
locator it doesn't work.  Now switch off the mouse before selecting another
mouse model.

When the CursorHold event is triggered and the commands peek for typed
characters the typeahead buffer may be messed up, e.g., when a mouse-up event
is received.  Avoid invoking the autocommands from the function waiting for a
character, let it put K_CURSORHOLD in the input buffer.

Removed the "COUNT" flag from ":argadd", to avoid ":argadd 1*" to be used like
":1argadd *".  Same for ":argdelete" and ":argedit".

Avoid that $LANG is used for the menus when LC_MESSAGES is "en_US".

Added backslashes before dashes in the vim.1 manual page to make the appear as
real dashes. (Pierr Habouzit)

Where "gq" left the cursor depended on the value of 'formatprg'.  Now "gq"
always leaves the cursor at the last line of the formatted text.

When editing a compressed file, such as "changelog.Debian.gz" file, filetype
detection may try to check the contents of the file while it's still
compressed.  Skip setting 'filetype' for compressed files until they have been
decompressed.  Required for patterns that end in a "*".

Starting with an argument "+cmd" or "-S script" causes the cursor the be moved
to the first line.  That breaks a BufReadPost autocommand that uses g`".
Don't move the cursor if it's somewhere past the first line.

"gg=G" while 'modifiable' is off was uninterruptible.

When 'encoding' is "sjis" inserting CTRL-V u d800 a few times causes a crash.
Don't insert a DBCS character with a NUL second byte.

In Insert mode CTRL-O <Home> didn't move the cursor.  Made "ins_at_eol" global
and reset it in nv_home().

Wildcard expansion failed: ":w /tmp/$$.`echo test`".  Don't put quotes around
spaces inside backticks.

After this sequence of commands: Y V p gv: the wrong line is selected.  Now
let "gv" select the text that was put, since the original text is deleted.
This should be the most useful thing to do.

":sleep 100u" sleeps for 100 seconds, not 100 usec as one might expect.  Give
an error message when the argument isn't recognized.

In gui_mch_draw_string() in gui_w32.c "unibuflen" wasn't static, resulting in
reallocating the buffer every time. (Alexei Alexandrov)

When using a Python "atexit" function it was not invoked when Vim exits.  Now
call Py_Finalize() for that. (Ugo Di Girolamo)
This breaks the thread stuff though, fixed by Ugo.

GTK GUI: using a .vimrc with "set cmdheight=2 lines=43" and ":split" right
after startup, the window layout is messed up. (Michael Schaap)  Added
win_new_shellsize() call in gui_init() to fix the topframe size.

Trick to get ...MOUSE_NM not used when there are vertical splits.  Now pass
column -1 for the left most window and add MOUSE_COLOFF for others.  Limits
mouse column to 10000.

searchpair() may hang when the end pattern has "\zs" at the end.  Check that
we find the same position again and advance one character.

When in diff mode and making a change that causes the "changed" highlighting
to disappear or reappear, it was still highlighted in another window.

When a ":next" command fails because the user selects "Abort" at the ATTENTION
prompt the argument index was advanced anyway.

When "~" is in 'iskeyword' the "gd" doesn't work, it's used for the previous
substitute pattern.  Put "\V" in the pattern to avoid that.

Use of sprintf() sometimes didn't check properly for buffer overflow.  Also
when using smsg().  Included code for snprintf() to avoid having to do size
checks where invoking them

":help \=<Tab>" didn't find "sub-replace-\=".  Wild menu for help tags didn't
show backslashes.  ":he :s\=" didn't work.

When reading an errorfile "~/" in a file name was not expanded.

GTK GUI: When adding a scrollbar (e.g. when using ":vsplit") in a script or
removing it the window size may change.  GTK sends us resize events when we
change the window size ourselves, but they may come at an unexpected moment.
Peek for a character to get any window resize events and fix 'columns' and
'lines' to undo this.

When using the GTK plug mechanism, resizing and focus was not working
properly. (Neil Bird)

After deleting files from the argument list a session file generated with
":mksession" may contain invalid ":next" commands.

When 'shortmess' is empty and 'keymap' set to accents, in Insert mode CTRL-N
may cause the hit-enter prompt.  Typing 'a then didn't result in the accented
character.  Put the character typed at the prompt back in the typeahead buffer
so that mapping is done in the right mode.

setbufvar() and setwinvar() did not give error messages.

It was possible to set a variable with an illegal name, e.g. with setbufvar().
It was possible to define a function with illegal name, e.t. ":func F{-1}()"

CTRL-W F and "gf" didn't use the same method to get the file name.

When reporting a conversion error the line number of the last error could be
given.  Now report the first encountered error.

When using ":e ++enc=name file" and iconv() was used for conversion an error
caused a fall-back to no conversion.  Now replace a character with '?' and
continue.

When opening a new buffer the local value of 'bomb' was not initialized from
the global value.

Win32: When using the "Edit with Vim" entry the file name was limited to about
200 characters.

When using command line completion for ":e *foo" and the file "+foo" exists
the resulting command ":e +foo" doesn't work.  Now insert a backslash: ":e
\+foo".

When the translation of "-- More --" was not 10 characters long the following
message would be in the wrong position.

At the more-prompt the last character in the last line wasn't drawn.

When deleting non-existing text while 'virtualedit' is set the '[ and '] marks
were not set.

Win32: Could not use "**/" in 'path', it had to be "**\".

The search pattern "\n" did not match at the end of the last line.

Searching for a pattern backwards, starting on the NUL at the end of the line
and 'encoding' is "utf-8" would match the pattern just before it incorrectly.
Affected searchpair('/\*', '', '\*/').

For the Find/Replace dialog it was possible that not finding the text resulted
in an error message while redrawing, which cleared the syntax highlighting
while it was being used, resulting in a crash.  Now don't clear syntax
highlighting, disable it with b_syn_error.

Win32: Combining UTF-8 characters were drawn on the previous character.
Could be noticed with a Thai font.

Output of ":function" could leave some of the typed text behind. (Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

When the command line history has only a few lines the command line window
would be opened with these lines above the first window line.

When using a command line window for search strings ":qa" would result in
searching for "qa" instead of quitting all windows.

GUI: When scrolling with the scrollbar and there is a line that doesn't fit
redrawing may fail.  Make sure w_skipcol is valid before redrawing.

Limit the values of 'columns' and 'lines' to avoid an overflow in Rows *
Columns.  Fixed bad effects when running out of memory (command line would be
reversed, ":qa!" resulted in ":!aq").

Motif: "gvim -iconic" opened the window anyway.  (David Harrison)

There is a tiny chance that a symlink gets created between checking for an
existing file and creating a file.  Use the O_NOFOLLOW for open() if it's
available.

In an empty line "ix<CTRL-O>0" moved the cursor to after the line instead of
sticking to the first column.

When using ":wq" and a BufWriteCmd autocmd uses inputsecret() the text was
echoed anyway.  Set terminal to raw mode in getcmdline().

Unix: ":w a;b~c" caused an error in expanding wildcards.

When appending to a file with ":w >>fname" in a buffer without a name, causing
the buffer to use "fname", the modified flag was reset.

When appending to the current file the "not edited" flag would be reset.
":w" would overwrite the file accidentally.

Unix: When filtering text with an external command Vim would still read input,
causing text typed for the command (e.g., a password) to be eaten and echoed.
Don't read input when the terminal is in cooked mode.

The Cygwin version of xxd used CR/LF line separators. (Corinna Vinschen)

Unix: When filtering text through a shell command some resulting text may be
dropped.  Now after detecting that the child has exited try reading some more
of its output.

When inside input(), using "CTRL-R =" and the expression throws an exception
the command line was not abandoned but it wasn't used either.  Now abandon
typing the command line.

'delcombine' was also used in Visual and Select mode and for commands like
"cl".  That was illogical and has been disabled.

When recording while a CursorHold autocommand was defined special keys would
appear in the register.  Now the CursorHold event is not triggered while
recording.

Unix: the src/configure script used ${srcdir-.}, not all shells understand
that.  Use ${srcdir:-.} instead.

When editing file "a" which is a symlink to file "b" that doesn't exist,
writing file "a" to create "b" and then ":split b" resulted in two buffers on
the same file with two different swapfile names.  Now set the inode in the
buffer when creating a new file.

When 'esckeys' is not set don't send the xterm code to request the version
string, because it may cause trouble in Insert mode.

When evaluating an expression for CTRL-R = on the command line it was possible
to call a function that opens a new window, resulting in errors for
incremental search, and many other nasty things were possible.  Now use the
|textlock| to disallow changing the buffer or jumping to another window
to protect from unexpected behavior.  Same for CTRL-\ e.

"d(" deleted the character under the cursor, while the documentation specified
an exclusive motion.  Vi also doesn't delete the character under the cursor.

Shift-Insert in Insert mode could put the cursor before the last character
when it just fits in the window.  In coladvance() don't stop at the window
edge when filling with spaces and when in Insert mode.  In mswin.vim avoid
getting a beep from the "l" command.

Win32 GUI: When Alt-F4 is used to close the window and Cancel is selected in
the dialog then Vim would insert <M-F4> in the text.  Now it's ignored.

When ":silent! {cmd}" caused the swap file dialog, which isn't displayed,
there would still be a hit-enter prompt.

Requesting the termresponse (|t_RV|) early may cause problems with "-c"
arguments that invoke an external command or even "-c quit".  Postpone it
until after executing "-c" arguments.

When typing in Insert mode so that a new line is started, using CTRL-G u to
break undo and start a new change, then joining the lines with <BS> caused
undo info to be missing.  Now reset the insertion start point.

Syntax HL: When a region start match has a matchgroup and an offset that
happens to be after the end of the line then it continued in the next line and
stopped at the region end match, making the region continue after that.
Now check for the column being past the end of the line in syn_add_end_off().

When changing a file, setting 'swapfile' off and then on again, making another
change and killing Vim, then some blocks may be missing from the swapfile.
When 'swapfile' is switched back on mark all blocks in the swapfile as dirty.
Added mf_set_dirty().

Expanding wildcards in a command like ":e aap;<>!" didn't work.  Put
backslashes before characters that are special to the shell. (Adri Verhoef)

A CursorHold autocommand would cause a message to be cleared.  Don't show the
special key for the event for 'showcmd'.

When expanding a file name for a shell command, as in "!cmd foo<Tab>" or ":r
!cmd foo<Tab>" also escape characters that are special for the shell:
"!;&()<>".

When the name of the buffer was set by a ":r fname" command |cpo-f| no
autocommands were triggered to notify about the change in the buffer list.

In the quickfix buffer 'bufhidden' was set to "delete", which caused closing
the quickfix window to leave an unlisted "No Name" buffer behind every time.

Win32: when using two screens of different size, setting 'lines' to a large
value didn't fill the whole screen. (SungHyun Nam)

Win32 installer: The generated _vimrc contained an absolute path to diff.exe.
After upgrading it becomes invalid.  Now use $VIMRUNTIME instead.

The command line was cleared to often when 'showmode' was set and ":silent
normal vy" was used.  Don't clear the command line unless the mode was
actually displayed.  Added the "mode_displayed" variable.

The "load session" toolbar item could not handle a space or other special
characters in v:this_session.

":set sta ts=8 sw=4 sts=2" deleted 4 spaces halfway a line instead of 2.

In a multi-byte file the foldmarker could be recognized in the trail byte.
(Taro Muraoka)

Pasting with CTRL-V and menu didn't work properly when some commands are
mapped.  Use ":normal!" instead of ":normal". (Tony Apuzzo)

Crashed when expanding a file name argument in backticks.

In some situations the menu and scrollbar didn't work, when the value contains
a CSI byte. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

GTK GUI: When drawing the balloon focus changes and we might get a key release
event that removed the balloon again.  Ignore the key release event.

'titleold' was included in ":mkexrc" and ":mksession" files.

":set background&" didn't use the same logic as was used when starting up.

When "umask" is set such that nothing is writable then the viminfo file would
be written without write permission. (Julian Bridle)

Motif: In diff mode dragging one scrollbar didn't update the scrollbar of the
other diff'ed window.

When editing in an xterm with a different number of colors than expected the
screen would be cleared and redrawn, causing the message about the edited file
to be cleared.  Now set "keep_msg" to redraw the last message.

For a color terminal: When the Normal HL uses bold, possibly to make the color
lighter, and another HL group specifies a color it might become light as well.
Now reset bold if a HL group doesn't specify bold itself.

When using 256 color xterm the color 255 would show up as color 0.  Use a
short instead of a char to store the color number.

ml_get errors when searching for "\n\zs" in an empty file.

When selecting a block and using "$" to select until the end of every line and
not highlighting the character under the cursor the first character of the
block could be unhighlighted.

When counting words for the Visual block area and using "$" to select until
the end of every line only up to the length of the last line was counted.

"dip" in trailing empty lines left one empty line behind.

The script ID was only remembered globally for each option. When a buffer- or
window-local option was set the same "last set" location was changed for all
buffers and windows.  Now remember the script ID for each local option
separately.

GUI: The "Replace All" button didn't handle backslashes in the replacement in
the same way as "Replace".  Escape backslashes so that they are taken
literally.

When using Select mode from Insert mode and typing a key, causing lines to be
deleted and a message displayed, delayed the effect of inserting the key.
Now overwrite the message without delay.

When 'whichwrap' includes "l" then "dl" and "yl" on a single letter line
worked differently.  Now recognize all operators when using "l" at the end of
a line.

GTK GUI: when the font selector returned a font name with a comma in it then
it would be handled like two font names.  Now put a backslash before the
comma.

MS-DOS, Win32: When 'encoding' defaults to "latin1" then the value for
'iskeyword' was still for CPxxx.  And when 'nocompatible' was set 'isprint'
would also be the wrong value.

When a command was defined not to take arguments and no '|' no warning message
would be given for using a '|'.  Also with ":loadkeymap".

Motif: When using a fontset and 'encoding' is "utf-8" and sizeof(wchar_t) !=
sizeof(XChar2b) then display was wrong. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

":all" always set the current window to the first window, even when it
contains a buffer that is not in the argument list (can't be closed because it
is modified).  Now go to the window that has the first item of the argument
list.

GUI: To avoid left-over pixels from bold text all characters after a character
with special attributes were redrawn.  Now only do this for characters that
actually are bold.  Speeds up displaying considerably.

When only highlighting changes and the text is scrolled at the same time
everything is redrawn instead of using a scroll and updating the changed text.
E.g., when using ":match" to highlight a paren that the cursor landed on.
Added SOME_VALID: Redraw the whole window but also try to scroll to minimize
redrawing.

Win32: When using Korean IME making it active didn't work properly. (Moon,
Yu-sung, 2005 March 21)

Ruby interface: when inserting/deleting lines display wasn't updated. (Ryan
Paul)

--- fixes since Vim 7.0b ---

Getting the GCC version in configure didn't work with Solaris sed.  First
strip any "darwin." and then get the version number.

The "autoload" directory was missing from the self-installing executable for
MS-Windows.

The MS-Windows install program would find "vimtutor.bat" in the install
directory.  After changing to "c:" also change to "\" to avoid looking in the
install directory.

To make the 16 bit DOS version compile exclude not used highlight
initializations and build a tiny instead of small version.

finddir() and findfile() accept a negative count and return a List then.

The Python indent file contained a few debugging statements, removed.

Expanding {} for a function name, resulting in a name starting with "s:" was
not handled correctly.

Spelling: renamed COMPOUNDMAX to COMPOUNDWORDMAX.  Added several items to be
able to handle the new Hungarian dictionary.

Mac: Default to building for the current platform only, that is much faster
than building a universal binary.  Also, using Perl/Python/etc. only works for
the current platform.

The time on undo messages disappeared for someone.  Using %T for strftime()
apparently doesn't work everywhere.  Use %H:%M:%S instead.

Typing BS at the "z=" prompt removed the prompt.

--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0c ---

When jumping to another tab page the Vim window size was always set, even when
nothing in the layout changed.

Win32 GUI tab pages line wasn't always enabled.  Do a proper check for the
compiler version.

Win32: When switching between tab pages the Vim window was moved when part of
it was outside of the screen.  Now only do that in the direction of a size
change.

Win32: added menu to GUI tab pages line. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Mac: Added document icons. (Benji Fisher)

Insert mode completion: Using Enter to accept the current match causes
confusion.  Use CTRL-Y instead.  Also, use CTRL-E to go back to the typed
text.

GUI: When there are left and right scrollbars, ":tabedit" kept them instead of
using the one that isn't needed.

Using "gP" to replace al the text could leave the cursor below the last line,
causing ml_get errors.

When 'cursorline' is set don't use the highlighting when Visual mode is
active, otherwise it's difficult to see the selected area.

The matchparen plugin restricts the search to 100 lines, to avoid a long delay
when there are closed folds.

Sometimes using CTRL-X s to list spelling suggestions used text from another
line.

Win32: Set the default for 'isprint' back to the wrong default "@,~-255",
because many people use Windows-1252 while 'encoding' is "latin1".

GTK: Added a workaround for gvim crashing when used over an untrusted ssh
link, caused by GTK doing something nasty. (Ed Catmur)

Win32: The font used for the tab page labels is too big.  Use the system menu
font. (George Reilly)

Win32: Adjusting the window position and size to keep it on the screen didn't
work properly when the taskbar is on the left or top of the screen.

The installman.sh and installml.sh scripts use ${10}, that didn't work with
old shells.  And use "test -f" instead of "test -e".

Win32: When 'encoding' was set in the vimrc then a directory argument for diff
mode didn't work.

GUI: at the inputlist() prompt the cursorshape was adjusted as if the windows
were still at their old position.

The parenmatch plugin didn't remember the highlighting per window.

Using ":bd" for a buffer that's the current window in another tab page caused
a crash.

For a new tab page the 'scroll' option wasn't set to a good default.

Using an end offset for a search "/pat/e" didn't work properly for multi-byte
text. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

":s/\n/,/" doubled the text when used on the last line.

When "search" is in 'foldopen' "[s" and "]s" now open folds.

When using a numbered function "dict" can be omitted, but "self" didn't work
then.  Always add FC_DICT to the function flags when it's part of a
dictionary.

When "--remote-tab" executes locally it left an empty tab page.

"gvim -u NONE", ":set cursorcolumn", "C" in the second line didn't update
text.  Do update further lines even though the "$" is displayed.

VMS: Support GTK better, also enable +clientserver. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

When highlighting of statusline or tabline is changed there was no redraw to
show the effect.

Mac: Added "CFBundleIdentifier" to infplist.xml.

Added tabpage-local variables t:var.

Win32: Added double-click in tab pages line creates new tab. (Yegappan
Lakshmanan)

Motif: Added GUI tab pages line. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Fixed crash when 'lines' was set to 1000 in a modeline.

When init_spellfile() finds a writable directory in 'runtimepath' but it
doesn't contain a "spell" directory, create one.

Win32: executable() also finds "xxd" in the directory where Vim was started,
but "!xxd" doesn't work.  Append the Vim starting directory to $PATH.

The tab page labels are shortened, directory names are reduced to a single
letter by default.  Added the pathshorten() function to allow a user to do the
same.

":saveas" now resets 'readonly' if the file was successfully written.

Set $MYVIMRC file to the first found .vimrc file.
Set $MYGVIMRC file to the first found .gvimrc file.
Added menu item "Startup Settings" that edits the $MYVIMRC file

Added matcharg().

Error message E745 appeared twice.  Renamed one to E786.

Fixed crash when using "au BufRead * Sexplore" and doing ":help".  Was wiping
out a buffer that's still in a window.

":hardcopy" resulted in an error message when 'encoding' is "utf-8" and
'printencoding' is empty.  Now it assumes latin1. (Mike Williams)

The check for the toolbar feature for Motif, depending on certain included
files, wasn't detailed enough, causing building to fail in gui_xmebw.c.

Using CTRL-E in Insert mode completion after CTRL-P inserted the first match
instead of the original text.

When displaying a UTF-8 character with a zero lower byte Vim might think the
previous character is double-wide.

The "nbsp" item of 'listchars' didn't work when 'encoding' was utf-8.

Motif: when Xm/xpm.h is missing gui_xmebw.c would not compile.
HAVE_XM_UNHIGHLIGHTT_H was missing a T.

Mac: Moved the .icns files into src/os_mac_rsrc, so that they can all be
copied at once.  Adjusted the Info.plist file for three icons.

When Visual mode is active while switching to another tabpage could get ml_get
errors.

When 'list' is set, 'nowrap' the $ in the first column caused 'cursorcolumn'
to move to the right.

When a line wraps, 'cursorcolumn' was never displayed past the end of the
line.

'autochdir' was only available when compiled with NetBeans and GUI.  Now it's
a separate feature, also available in the "big" version.

Added CTRL-W gf: open file under cursor in new tab page.

When using the menu in the tab pages line, "New Tab" opens the new tab before
where the click was.  Beyond the labels the new tab appears at the end instead
of after the current tab page.

Inside a mapping with an expression getchar() could not be used.

When vgetc is used recursively vgetc_busy protects it from being used
recursively.  But after a ":normal" command the protection was reset.

":s/a/b/n" didn't work when 'modifiable' was off.

When $VIMRUNTIME includes a multi-byte character then rgb.txt could not be
found. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

":mkspell" didn't work correctly for non-ASCII affix flags when conversion is
needed on the spell file.

glob('/dir/\$ABC/*') didn't work.

When using several tab pages and changing 'cmdheight' the display could become
messed up.  Now store the value of 'cmdheight' separately for each tab page.

The user of the Enter key while the popup menu is visible was still confusing.
Now use Enter to select the match after using a cursor key.

Added "usetab" to 'switchbuf'.


--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0d ---

Added CTRL-W T: move a window to a new tab page.

Using CTRL-X s in Insert mode to complete spelling suggestions and using BS
deleted characters before the bad word.

A few small fixes for the VMS makefile. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

With a window of 91 lines 45 cols, ":vsp" scrolled the window.  Copy w_wrow
when splitting a window and skip setting the height when it's already at the
right value.

Using <silent> in a mapping with a shell command and the GUI caused redraw
to use wrong attributes.

Win32: Using MSVC 4.1 for install.exe resulted in the start menu items to be
created in the administrator directory instead of "All Users".  Define the
CSIDL_ items if they are missing.

Motif: The GUI tabline did not use the space above the right scrollbar.  Work
around a bug in the Motif library. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

The extra files for XML Omni completion are now also installed.
|xml-omni-datafile|

GTK GUI: when 'm' is missing from 'guioptions' during startup and pressing
<F10> GTK produced error messages.  Now do create the menu but disable it just
after the first gui_mch_update().

":mkspell" doesn't work well with the Hungarian dictionary from the Hunspell
project.  Back to the Myspell dictionary.

In help files hide the | used around tags.

Renamed pycomplete to pythoncomplete.

Added "tabpages" to 'sessionoptions'.

When 'guitablabel' is set the effect wasn't visible right away.

Fixed a few 'cindent' errors.

When completing menu names, e.g., after ":emenu", don't sort the entries but
keep them in the original order.

Fixed a crash when editing a directory in diff mode.  Don't trigger
autocommands when executing the diff command.

Getting a keystroke could get stuck if 'encoding' is a multi-byte encoding and
typing a special key.

When 'foldignore' is set the folds were not updated right away.

When a list is indexed with [a : b] and b was greater than the length an error
message was given.  Now silently truncate the result.

When using BS during Insert mode completion go back to the original text, so
that CTRL-N selects the first matching entry.

Added the 'M' flag to 'cinoptions'.

Win32: Make the "gvim --help" window appear in the middle of the screen
instead of at an arbitrary position. (Randall W. Morris)

Added gettabwinvar() and settabwinvar().

Command line completion: pressing <Tab> after ":e /usr/*" expands the whole
tree, because it becomes ":e /usr/**".  Don't add a star if there already is
one.

Added grey10 to grey90 to all GUIs, so that they can all be used for
initializing highlighting.  Use grey40 for CursorColumn and CursorLine when
'background' is "dark".

When reading a file and using iconv for conversion, an incomplete byte
sequence at the end caused problems. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)


--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0e ---

Default color for MatchParen when 'background' is "dark" is now DarkCyan.

":syn off" had to be used twice in a file that sets 'syntax' in a modeline.
(Michael Geddes)

When using ":vsp" or ":sp" the available space wasn't used equally between
windows. (Servatius Brandt)

Expanding <cWORD> on a trailing blank resulted in the first word in the line
if 'encoding' is a multi-byte encoding.

Spell checking: spellbadword() didn't see a missing capital in the first word
of a line.  Popup menu now only suggest the capitalized word when appropriate.

When using whole line completion CTRL-L moves through the matches but it
didn't work when at the original text.

When completion finds the longest match, don't go to the first match but stick
at the original text, so that CTRL-N selects the first one.

Recognize "zsh-beta" like "zsh" for setting the 'shellpipe' default. (James
Vega)

When using ":map <expr>" and the expression results in something with a
special byte (NUL or CSI) then it didn't work properly.  Now escape special
bytes.

The default Visual highlighting for a color xterm with 8 colors was a magenta
background, which made magenta text disappear.  Now use reverse in this
specific situation.

After completing the longest match "." didn't insert the same text.  Repeating
also didn't work correctly for multi-byte text.

When using Insert mode completion and BS the whole word that was completed
would result in all possible matches.  Now stop completion.  Also fixes that
for spell completion the previous word was deleted.

GTK: When 'encoding' is "latin1" and using non-ASCII characters in a file name
the tab page label was wrong and an error message would be given.

The taglist() function could hang on a tags line with a non-ASCII character.

Win32: When 'encoding' differs from the system encoding tab page labels with
non-ASCII characters looked wrong. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Motif: building failed when Xm/Notebook.h doesn't exist.  Added a configure
check, disable GUI tabline when it's missing.

Mac: When compiled without multi-byte feature the clipboard didn't work.

It was possible to switch to another tab page when the cmdline window is open.

Completion could hang when 'lines' is 6 and a preview window was opened.

Added CTRL-W gF: open file under cursor in new tab page and jump to the line
number following the file name.
Added 'guitabtooltip'.  Implemented for Win32 (Yegappan Lakshmanan).

Added "throw" to 'debug' option: throw an exception for error messages even
whey they would otherwise be ignored.

When 'keymap' is set and a line contains an invalid entry could get a "No
mapping found" warning instead of a proper error message.

Motif: default to using XpmAttributes instead of XpmAttributes_21.

A few more changes for 64 bit MS-Windows. (George Reilly)

Got ml_get errors when doing "o" and selecting in other window where there are
less lines shorter than the cursor position in the other window.  ins_mouse()
was using position in wrong window.

Win32 GUI: Crash when giving a lot of messages during startup.  Allocate twice
as much memory for the dialog template.

Fixed a few leaks and wrong pointer use reported by coverity.

When showing menus the mode character was sometimes wrong.

Added feedkeys(). (Yakov Lerner)

Made matchlist() always return all submatches.

Moved triggering QuickFixCmdPost to before jumping to the first location.

Mac: Added the 'macatsui' option as a temporary work around for text drawing
problems.

Line completion on "/**" gave error messages when scanning an unloaded buffer.

--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0f ---

Win32: The height of the tab page labels is now adjusted to the font height.
(Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Win32: selecting the tab label was off by one. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Added tooltips for Motif and GTK tab page labels. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

When 'encoding' is "utf-8" then ":help spell" would report an illegal byte and
the file was not converted from latin1 to utf-8.  Now retry with latin1 if
reading the file as utf-8 results in illegal bytes.

Escape the argument of feedkeys() before putting it in the typeahead buffer.
(Yukihiro Nakadaira)

Added the v:char variable for evaluating 'formatexpr'. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

With 8 colors Search highlighting combined with Statement highlighted text
made the text disappear.

VMS: avoid warnings for redefining MAX and MIN. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

When 'virtualedit' includes "onemore", stopping Visual selection would still
move the cursor left.

Prevent that using CTRL-R = in Insert mode can start Visual mode.

Fixed a crash that occurred when in Insert mode with completion active and a
mapping caused edit() to be called recursively.

When using CTRL-O in Insert mode just after the last character while
'virtualedit' is "all", then typing CR moved the last character to the next
line.  Call coladvance() before starting the new line.

When using |:shell| ignore clicks on the tab page labels.  Also when using the
command line window.

When 'eventignore' is "all" then adding more to ignoring some events, e.g.,
for ":vimgrep", would actually trigger more events.

Win32: When a running Vim uses server name GVIM1 then "gvim --remote fname"
didn't find it.  When looking for a server name that doesn't end in a digit
and it is not found then use another server with that name and a number (just
like on Unix).

When using "double" in 'spellsuggest' when the language doesn't support sound
folding resulted in too many suggestions.

Win32: Dropping a shortcut on the Vim icon didn't edit the referred file like
editing it in another way would.  Use fname_expand() in buf_set_name() instead
of simply make the file name a full path.

Using feedkeys() could cause Vim to hang.

When closing another tab page from the tabline menu in Insert mode the tabline
was not updated right away.

The syntax menu didn't work in compatible mode.

After using ":tag id" twice with the same "id", ":ts" and then ":pop" a ":ts"
reported no matching tag.  Clear the cached tag name.

In Insert mode the matchparen plugin highlighted the wrong paren when there is
a string just next to a paren.

GTK: After opening a new tab page the text was sometimes not drawn correctly.
Flush output and catch up with events when updating the tab page labels.

In the GUI, using CTRL-W q to close the last window of a tab page could cause
a crash.

GTK: The tab pages line menu was not converted from 'encoding' to utf-8.

Typing a multi-byte character or a special key at the hit-enter prompt did not
work.

When 'virtualedit' contains "onemore" CTRL-O in Insert mode still moved the
cursor left when it was after the end of the line, even though it's allowed to
be there.

Added test for using tab pages.

towupper() and towlower() were not used, because of checking for
__STDC__ISO_10646__ instead of __STDC_ISO_10646__. (sertacyildiz)

For ":map <expr>" forbid changing the text, jumping to another buffer and
using ":normal" to avoid nasty side effects.

--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0g ---

Compilation error on HP-UX, use of "dlerr" must be inside a #ifdef.
(Gary Johnson)

Report +reltime feature in ":version" output.

The tar and zip plugins detect failure to get the contents of the archive and
edit the file as-is.

When the result of 'guitablabel' is empty fall back to the default label.

Fixed crash when using ":insert" in a while loop and missing "endwhile".

"gt" and other commands could move to another window when |textlock| active
and when the command line window was open.

Spell checking a file with syntax highlighting and a bad word at the end of
the line is ignored could make "]s" hang.

Mac: inputdialog() didn't work when compiled with big features.

Interrupting ":vimgrep" while it is busy loading a file left a modified and
hidden buffer behind.  Use enter_cleanup() and leave_cleanup() around
wipe_buffer().

When making 'keymap' empty the b:keymap_name variable wasn't deleted.

Using CTRL-N that searches a long time, pressing space to interrupt the
searching and accept the first match, the popup menu was still displayed
briefly.

When setting the Vim window height with -geometry the 'window' option could be
at a value that makes CTRL-F behave differently.

When opening a quickfix window in two tabs they used different buffers,
causing redrawing problems later.  Now use the same buffer for all quickfix
windows. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

When 'mousefocus' is set moving the mouse to the text tab pages line would
move focus to the first window.  Also, the mouse pointer would jump to the
active window.

In a session file, when an empty buffer is wiped out, do this silently.

When one window has the cursor on the last line and another window is resized
to make that window smaller, the cursor line could go below the displayed
lines.  In win_new_height() subtract one from the available space.
Also avoid that using "~" lines makes the window scroll down.

Mac: When sourcing the "macmap.vim" script and then finding a .vimrc file the
'cpo' option isn't set properly, because it was already set and restored.
Added the <special> argument to ":map", so that 'cpo' doesn't need to be
changed to be able to use <> notation.  Also do this for ":menu" for
consistency.

When using "/encoding=abc" in a spell word list, only "bc" was used.

When 'encoding' and 'printencoding' were both "utf-8" then ":hardcopy" didn't
work. (Mike Williams)

Mac: When building with "--disable-gui" the install directory would still be
"/Applications" and Vim.app would be installed.  Now install in /usr/local as
usual for a console application.

GUI: when doing completion and there is one match and still searching for
another, the cursor was displayed at the end of the line instead of after the
match.  Now show the cursor after the match while still searching for matches.

GUI: The mouse shape changed on the statusline even when 'mouse' was empty and
they can't be dragged.

GTK2: Selecting a button in the confirm() dialog with Tab or cursor keys and
hitting Enter didn't select that button.  Removed GTK 1 specific code. (Neil
Bird)

When evaluating 'balloonexpr' takes a long time it could be called
recursively, which could cause a crash.

exists() could not be used to detect whether ":2match" is supported.  Added a
check for it specifically.

GTK1: Tab page labels didn't work. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Insert mode completion: When finding matches use 'ignorecase', but when adding
matches to the list don't use it, so that all words with different case are
added, "word", "Word" and "WORD".

When 'cursorline' and 'hlsearch' are set and the search pattern is "x\n"
the rest of the line was highlighted as a match.

Cursor moved while evaluating 'balloonexpr' that invokes ":isearch" and
redirects the output.  Don't move the cursor to the command line if msg_silent
is set.

exists() ignored text after a function name and option name, which could
result in false positives.

exists() ignored characters after the recognized word, which can be wrong when
using a name with non-keyword characters.  Specifically, these calls no longer
allow characters after the name: exists('*funcname') exists('*funcname(...')
exists('&option') exists(':cmd') exists('g:name') exists('g:name[n]')
exists('g:name.n')

Trigger the TabEnter autocommand only after entering the current window of the
tab page, otherwise the commands are executed with an invalid current window.

Win32: When using two monitors and Vim is on the second monitor, changing the
width of the Vim window could make it jump to the first monitor.

When scrolling back at the more prompt and the quitting a line of text would
be left behind when 'cmdheight' is 2 or more.

Fixed a few things for Insert mode completion, especially when typing BS,
CTRL-N or a printable character while still searching for matches.

Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.009
Problem:    ml_get errors with both 'sidescroll' and 'spell' set.

Patch 7.0.035
Problem:    Insert mode completion works when typed but not when replayed from
	    a register. (Hari Krishna Dara)
	    Also: Mappings for Insert mode completion don't always work.
Solution:   When finding a non-completion key in the input don't interrupt
	    completion when it wasn't typed.
	    Do use mappings when checking for typeahead while still finding
	    completions.  Avoids that completion is interrupted too soon.
	    Use "compl_pending" in a different way.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 7.0.036
Problem:    Can't compile with small features and syntax highlighting or the
	    diff feature.
Solution:   Define LINE_ATTR whenever syntax highlighting or the diff feature

Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 7.0.038
Problem:    When calling complete() from an Insert mode expression mapping
	    text could be inserted in an improper way.
Solution:   Make undo_allowed() global and use it in complete().
Files:	    src/undo.c, src/proto/undo.pro, src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.039
Problem:    Calling inputdialog() with a third argument in the console doesn't
	    work.
Solution:   Make a separate function for input() and inputdialog(). (Yegappan
	    Lakshmanan)
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.040
Problem:    When 'cmdheight' is larger than 1 using inputlist() or selecting
	    a spell suggestion with the mouse gets the wrong entry.
Solution:   Start listing the first alternative on the last line of the screen.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/spell.c

Patch 7.0.041
Problem:    cursor([1, 1]) doesn't work. (Peter Hodge)
Solution:   Allow leaving out the third item of the list and use zero for the
	    virtual column offset.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.042
Problem:    When pasting a block of text in Insert mode Vim hangs or crashes.
	    (Noam Halevy)
Solution:   Avoid that the cursor is positioned past the NUL of a line.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 7.0.043
Problem:    Using "%!" at the start of 'statusline' doesn't work.
Solution:   Recognize the special item when the option is being set.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 7.0.044
Problem:    Perl: setting a buffer line in another buffer may result in
	    changing the current buffer.
Solution:   Properly change to the buffer to be changed.
Files:	    src/if_perl.xs

Patch 7.0.045 (extra)

Solution:   Move including vim.h to before windows.h. (Ilya Bobir)
Files:	    src/if_ole.cpp

Patch 7.0.046
Problem:    The matchparen plugin ignores parens in strings, but not in single
	    quotes, often marked with "character".
Solution:   Also ignore parens in syntax items matching "character".
Files:	    runtime/plugin/matchparen.vim

Patch 7.0.047
Problem:    When running configure the exit status is wrong.
Solution:   Handle the exit status properly. (Matthew Woehlke)
Files:	    configure, src/configure

Patch 7.0.048
Problem:    Writing a compressed file fails when there are parens in the name.
	    (Wang Jian)
Solution:   Put quotes around the temp file name.
Files:	    runtime/autoload/gzip.vim

Patch 7.0.049

Files:	    runtime/scripts.vim

Patch 7.0.050
Problem:    After using the netbeans interface close command a stale pointer
	    may be used.
Solution:   Clear the pointer to the closed buffer. (Xaview de Gaye)

	    were created before detecting the error.
Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 7.0.055
Problem:    ":startinsert" in a CmdwinEnter autocommand doesn't take immediate
	    effect. (Bradley White)

Files:	    src/if_perl.xs

Patch 7.0.060 (after 7.0.51)
Problem:    Code for temporarily switching to another buffer is duplicated in
	    quite a few places.
Solution:   Use aucmd_prepbuf() and aucmd_restbuf() also when FEAT_AUTOCMD is
	    not defined.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/eval.c, src/fileio.c, src/if_ruby.c,
	    src/if_perl.xs, src/quickfix.c, src/structs.h

Patch 7.0.061
Problem:    Insert mode completion for Vim commands may crash if there is
	    nothing to complete.
Solution:   Instead of freeing the pattern make it empty, so that a "not
	    found" error is given. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 7.0.062
Problem:    Mac: Crash when using the popup menu for spell correction.  The
	    popup menu appears twice when letting go of the right mouse button
	    early.

	    short file name when it shouldn't.  Window-local options from a
	    modeline may be applied to the wrong window. (Teemu Likonen)
Solution:   Add the did_lcd flag, use the full path when it's set.  Don't use

Files:	    src/fileio.c,  src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 7.0.240

==============================================================================
VERSION 7.3					*version-7.3* *version7.3*

This section is about improvements made between version 7.2 and 7.3.

This release has hundreds of bug fixes and there are a few new features.  The
most notable new features are:


Persistent undo					*new-persistent-undo*
---------------

Store undo information in a file.  Can undo to before when the file was read,
also for unloaded buffers. See |undo-persistence| (partly by Jordan Lewis)

Added the ":earlier 1f" and ":later 1f" commands.
Added file save counter to undo information.
Added the |undotree()| and |undofile()| functions.

Also added the 'undoreload' option.  This makes it possible to save the
current text when reloading the buffer, so that the reload can be undone.


More encryption					*new-more-encryption*
---------------

Support for Blowfish encryption.  Added the 'cryptmethod' option.
Mostly by Mohsin Ahmed.

Also encrypt the text in the swap file and the undo file.


Conceal text					*new-conceal*
------------

Added the |+conceal| feature.  (Vince Negri)
This allows hiding stretches of text, based on syntax highlighting.
It also allows replacing a stretch of text by a character |:syn-cchar|.
The 'conceallevel' option specifies what happens with text matching a syntax
item that has the conceal attribute.
The 'concealcursor' option specifies what happens in the cursor line.

The help files conceal characters used to mark tags and examples.

Added the |synconcealed()| function and use it for :TOhtml. (Benjamin Fritz)

Added the 'cursorbind' option, keeps the cursor in two windows with the same
text in sync.


Lua interface					*new-lua*
-------------

Added the |Lua| interface.  (Luis Carvalho)


Python3 interface				*new-python3*
-----------------

Added the Python3 interface.  It exists next to Python 2.x, both can be used
at the same time.  See |python3| (Roland Puntaier)


Changed							*changed-7.3*
-------

The MS-Windows installer no longer requires the user to type anything in the
console windows.  The installer now also works on 64 bit systems, including
the "Edit with Vim" context menu.
The gvim executable is 32 bits, the installed gvimext.dll is either a 32 or 64
bit version. (mostly by George Reilly)
Made the DOS installer work with more compilers.
The MS-Windows big gvim is now built with Python 2.7 and 3.1.2, Perl 5.12 and
Ruby 1.9.1.  You need the matching .dll files to use them.

The extra and language files are no longer distributed separately.
The source files for all systems are included in one distribution.

After using ":recover" or recovering a file in another way, ":x" and "ZZ"
didn't save what you see.  This could result in work being lost.  Now the text
after recovery is compared to the original file contents.  When they differ
the buffer is marked as modified.

When Vim is exiting because of a deadly signal, when v:dying is 2 or more,
VimLeavePre, VimLeave, BufWinLeave and BufUnload autocommands are not
executed.

Removed support for GTK 1.  It was no longer maintained and required a lot of
#ifdefs in the source code.  GTK 2 should be available for every system.
(James Vega)

It is no longer allowed to set the 'encoding' option from a modeline.  It
would corrupt the text.  (Patrick Texier)

Renamed runtime/spell/fixdup to runtime/spell/fixdup.vim.

Removed obsolete Mac code.

Updated spell files for Ubuntu locale names.

Switched from autoconf 2.63 to 2.65.

Removed Mupad indent and ftplugin files, they are not useful.

The maximum number of messages remembered in the history is now 200 (was 100).


Added							*added-7.3*
-----

Added the 'relativenumber' option. (Markus Heidelberg)

Added the 'colorcolumn' option: highlight one or more columns in a window.
E.g. to highlight the column after 'textwidth'. (partly by Gregor Uhlenheuer)

Added support for NetBeans in a terminal.  Added |:nbstart| and |:nbclose|.
(Xavier de Gaye)

More floating point functions: |acos()|, |asin()|, |atan2()|, |cosh()|,
|exp()|, |fmod()|, |log()|, |sinh()|, |tan()|, |tanh()|.  (Bill McCarthy)

Added the |gettabvar()| and |settabvar()| functions. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Added the |strchars()|, |strwidth()| and |strdisplaywidth()| functions.

Support GDK_SUPER_MASK for GTK on Mac. (Stephan Schulz)

Made CTRL and ALT modifier work for mouse wheel. (Benjamin Haskell)

Added support for horizontal scroll wheel. (Bjorn Winckler)

When the buffer is in diff mode, have :TOhtml create HTML to show the diff
side-by-side.  (Christian Brabandt)

Various improvements to ":TOhtml" and the 2html.vim script.  (Benjamin Fritz)

Add the 'L' item to 'cinoptions'. (Manuel Konig)

Improve Javascript indenting.  Add "J" flag to 'cinoptions'. (Hari Kumar G)

Mac: Support disabling antialias. (LC Mi)

Mac: Add clipboard support in the Mac console. (Bjorn Winckler)

Make it possible to drag a tab page label to another position. (Paul B. Mahol)

Better implementation of creating the Color Scheme menu. (Juergen Kraemer)

In Visual mode with 'showcmd' display the number of bytes and characters.

Allow synIDattr() getting GUI attributes when built without GUI.  (Matt
Wozniski)

Support completion for ":find".  Added test 73. (Nazri Ramliy)

Command line completion for :ownsyntax and :setfiletype. (Dominique Pelle)

Command line completion for :lmap and :lunmap.

Support syntax and filetype completion for user commands. (Christian Brabandt)

Avoid use of the GTK main_loop() so that the GtkFileChooser can be used.
(James Vega)

When 'formatexpr' evaluates to non-zero fall back to internal formatting, also
for "gq". (James Vega)

Support :browse for commands that use an error file argument. (Lech Lorens)

Support wide file names in gvimext. (Szabolcs Horvat)

Improve test for joining lines. (Milan Vancura)
Make joining a range of lines much faster. (Milan Vancura)

Add patch to improve support of z/OS (OS/390). (Ralf Schandl)

Added the helphelp.txt file.  Moved text from various.txt to it.

Added "q" item for 'statusline'.  Added |w:quickfix_title|. (Lech Lorens)

Various improvements for VMS. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

Patch 7.2.041
Problem:    In diff mode, when using two tabs, each with two diffed buffers,

==============================================================================
VERSION 7.4					*version-7.4* *version7.4*

This section is about improvements made between version 7.3 and 7.4.

This release has hundreds of bug fixes and there are a few new features.  The
most notable new features are:

- New regexp engine			|new-regexp-engine|
- A more pythonic Python interface	|better-python-interface|


New regexp engine					*new-regexp-engine*
-----------------

What is now called the "old" regexp engine uses a backtracking algorithm.  It
tries to match the pattern with the text in one way, and when that fails it
goes back and tries another way.  This works fine for simple patterns, but
complex patterns can be very slow on longer text.

The new engine uses a state machine.  It tries all possible alternatives at
the current character and stores the possible states of the pattern.  This is
a bit slower for simple patterns, but much faster for complex patterns and
long text.

Most notably, syntax highlighting for Javascript and XML files with long lines
is now working fine.  Previously Vim could get stuck.

More information here: |two-engines|


Better Python interface				*better-python-interface*
-----------------------

Added |python-bindeval| function. Unlike |python-eval| this one returns 
|python-Dictionary|, |python-List| and |python-Function| objects for 
dictionaries lists and functions respectively in place of their Python 
built-in equivalents (or None if we are talking about function references).
   For simple types this function returns Python built-in types and not only 
Python `str()` like |python-eval| does. On Python 3 it will return `bytes()` 
objects in place of `str()` ones avoiding possibility of UnicodeDecodeError.
   Interface of new objects mimics standard Python `dict()` and `list()`
interfaces to some extent. Extent will be improved in the future.

Added special |python-vars| objects also available for |python-buffer| and 
|python-window|. They ease access to VimL variables from Python.

Now you no longer need to alter `sys.path` to import your module: special 
hooks are responsible for importing from {rtp}/python2, {rtp}/python3 and 
{rtp}/pythonx directories (for Python 2, Python 3 and both respectively). 
See |python-special-path|.

Added possibility to work with |tabpage|s through |python-tabpage| object.

Added automatic conversion of Vim errors and exceptions to Python 
exceptions.

Changed the behavior of the |python-buffers| object: it now uses buffer numbers 
as keys in place of the index of the buffer in the internal buffer list. 
This should not break anything as the only way to get this index was 
iterating over |python-buffers|.

Added |:pydo| and |:py3do| commands.

Added the |pyeval()| and |py3eval()| functions.

Now in all places which previously accepted `str()` objects, `str()` and
`unicode()` (Python 2) or `bytes()` and `str()` (Python 3) are accepted.

|python-window| has gained `.col` and `.row` attributes that are currently 
the only way to get internal window positions.

Added or fixed support for `dir()` in Vim Python objects.


Changed							*changed-7.4*
-------

Old Python versions (≤2.2) are no longer supported. Building with them did 
not work anyway.

Options:
	Added ability to automatically save the selection into the system 
	clipboard when using non-GUI version of Vim (autoselectplus in 
	'clipboard'). Also added ability to use the system clipboard as
	default register (previously only primary selection could be used).
	(Ivan Krasilnikov, Christian Brabandt, Bram Moolenaar)

	Added a special 'shiftwidth' value that makes 'sw' follow 'tabstop'.
	As indenting via 'indentexpr' became tricky |shiftwidth()| function
	was added. Also added equivalent special value to 'softtabstop'
	option.  (Christian Brabandt, so8res)

	Show absolute number in number column when 'relativenumber' option is
	on.  Now there are four combinations with 'number' and
	'relativenumber'.  (Christian Brabandt)

Commands:
	|:diffoff| now saves the local values of some settings and restores 
	them in place of blindly resetting them to the defaults. (Christian 
	Brabandt)

Other:
	Lua interface now also uses userdata binded to Vim structures. (Taro 
	Muraoka, Luis Carvalho)

	glob() and autocommand patterns used to work with the undocumented
	"\{n,m\}" item from a regexp.  "\{" is now used for a literal "{", as
	this is normal in shell file patterns.  Now used "\\\{n,m\}" to get
	"\{n,m}" in the regexp pattern.

Added							*added-7.4*
-----

Various syntax, indent and other plugins were added.

Added support for |Lists| and |Dictionaries| in |viminfo|. (Christian
Brabandt)

Functions:
	Bitwise functions: |and()|, |or()|, |invert()|, |xor()|.

	Added |luaeval()| function. (Taro Muraoka, Luis Carvalho)

	Added |sha256()| function. (Tyru, Hirohito Higashi)

	Added |wildmenumode()| function. (Christian Brabandt)

	Debugging functions: |screenattr()|, |screenchar()|, |screencol()|, 
	|screenrow()|. (Simon Ruderich, Bram Moolenaar)

	Added ability to use |Dictionary-function|s for |sort()|ing, via 
	optional third argument. (Nikolay Pavlov)

	Added special |expand()| argument that expands to the current line 
	number.

	Made it possible to force |char2nr()| to always give unicode codepoints 
	regardless of current encoding. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

	Made it possible for functions generating file list generate |List| 
	and not NL-separated string. (e.g. |glob()|, |expand()|) (Christian 
	Brabandt)

	Functions that obtain variables from the specific window, tabpage or 
	buffer scope dictionary can now return specified default value in 
	place of empty string in case variable is not found. (|gettabvar()|, 
	|getwinvar()|, |getbufvar()|) (Shougo Matsushita, Hirohito Higashi)

Autocommands:
	Added |InsertCharPre| event launched before inserting character. 
	(Jakson A. Aquino)

	Added |CompleteDone| event launched after finishing completion in 
	insert mode. (idea by Florian Klein)

	Added |QuitPre| event launched when commands that can either close Vim 
	or only some window(s) are launched.

	Added |TextChanged| and |TextChangedI| events launched when text is 
	changed.

Commands:
	|:syntime| command useful for debugging.

	Made it possible to remove all signs from the current buffer using 
	|:sign-unplace|. (Christian Brabandt)

	Added |:language| autocompletion. (Dominique Pelle)

	Added more |:command-complete| completion types: |:behave| suboptions, 
	color schemes, compilers, |:cscope| suboptions, files from 'path', 
	|:history| suboptions, locale names, |:syntime| suboptions, user 
	names. (Dominique Pelle)

	Added |:map-nowait| creating mapping which when having lhs that is the 
	prefix of another mapping’s lhs will not allow Vim to wait for user to 
	type more characters to resolve ambiguity, forcing Vim to take the 
	shorter alternative: one with <nowait>.

Options:
	Made it possible to ignore case when completing: 'wildignorecase'.

	Added ability to delete comment leader when using |J| by `j` flag in 
	'formatoptions' (|fo-table|). (Lech Lorens)

	Added ability to control indentation inside namespaces: |cino-N|. 
	(Konstantin Lepa)

	Added ability to control alignment inside `if` condition separately 
	from alignment inside function arguments: |cino-k|. (Lech Lorens)

Other:
	Improved support for cmd.exe. (Ben Fritz, Bram Moolenaar)

	Added |v:windowid| variable containing current window number in GUI 
	Vim. (Christian J. Robinson, Lech Lorens)

	Added rxvt-unicode and SGR mouse support. (Yiding Jia, Hayaki Saito)
