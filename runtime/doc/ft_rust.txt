INTRODUCTION                                                      *rust-intro*

This plugin provides syntax and supporting functionality for the Rust
filetype. It requires Vim 8 or higher for full functionality. Some commands
will not work on earlier versions.

==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                       *rust-settings*

This plugin has a few variables you can define in your vimrc that change the
behavior of the plugin.

Some variables can be set buffer local (`:b` prefix), and the buffer local
will take precedence over the global `g:` counterpart.

                                                                *g:rustc_path*
g:rustc_path ~
	Set this option to the path to rustc for use in the |:RustRun| and
	|:RustExpand| commands. If unset, `rustc` will be located in $PATH: >vim
	    let g:rustc_path = $HOME."/bin/rustc"
<

                                                  *g:rustc_makeprg_no_percent*
g:rustc_makeprg_no_percent ~
	Set this option to 1 to have 'makeprg' default to `rustc` instead of
	`rustc %`: >vim
	    let g:rustc_makeprg_no_percent = 1
<

                                                              *g:rust_conceal*
g:rust_conceal ~
	Set this option to turn on the basic |conceal| support: >vim
	    let g:rust_conceal = 1
<

                                                     *g:rust_conceal_mod_path*
g:rust_conceal_mod_path ~
	Set this option to turn on |conceal| for the path connecting token
	"::": >vim
	    let g:rust_conceal_mod_path = 1
<

                                                          *g:rust_conceal_pub*
g:rust_conceal_pub ~
	Set this option to turn on |conceal| for the "pub" token: >vim
	    let g:rust_conceal_pub = 1
<

                                                     *g:rust_recommended_style*
g:rust_recommended_style ~
        Set this option to enable vim indentation and textwidth settings to
        conform to style conventions of the rust standard library (i.e. use 4
        spaces for indents and sets 'textwidth' to 99). This option is enabled
	by default. To disable it: >vim
	    let g:rust_recommended_style = 0
<

                                                                 *g:rust_fold*
g:rust_fold ~
	Set this option to turn on |folding|: >vim
	    let g:rust_fold = 1
<
	Value		Effect ~
	0		No folding
	1		Braced blocks are folded. All folds are open by
			default.
	2		Braced blocks are folded. 'foldlevel' is left at the
			global value (all folds are closed by default).

						  *g:rust_bang_comment_leader*
g:rust_bang_comment_leader ~
	Set this option to 1 to preserve the leader on multi-line doc comments
	using the `/*!` syntax: >vim
	    let g:rust_bang_comment_leader = 1
<

                                                *g:rust_use_custom_ctags_defs*
g:rust_use_custom_ctags_defs ~
	Set this option to 1 if you have customized ctags definitions for Rust
	and do not wish for those included with rust.vim to be used: >vim
	    let g:rust_use_custom_ctags_defs = 1
<

	NOTE: rust.vim's built-in definitions are only used for the Tagbar Vim
	plugin, if you have it installed, AND if Universal Ctags is not
	detected. This is because Universal Ctags already has built-in
	support for Rust when used with Tagbar.

	Also, note that when using ctags other than Universal Ctags, it is not
	automatically used when generating |tags| files that Vim can use to
	navigate to definitions across different source files. Feel free to
	copy `rust.vim/ctags/rust.ctags` into your own `~/.ctags` if you wish
	to generate |tags| files.

                                                 *g:ftplugin_rust_source_path*
g:ftplugin_rust_source_path ~
	Set this option to a path that should be prepended to 'path' for Rust
	source files: >vim
	    let g:ftplugin_rust_source_path = $HOME . '/dev/rust'
<

						       *g:rustfmt_command*
g:rustfmt_command ~
	Set this option to the name of the "rustfmt" executable in your $PATH. If
	not specified it defaults to "rustfmt" : >vim
	    let g:rustfmt_command = 'rustfmt'
<
						       *g:rustfmt_autosave*
g:rustfmt_autosave ~
	Set this option to 1 to run |:RustFmt| automatically when saving a
	buffer. If not specified it defaults to 0 : >vim
	    let g:rustfmt_autosave = 0
<
	There is also a buffer-local b:rustfmt_autosave that can be set for
	the same purpose, and can override the global setting.

                                        *g:rustfmt_autosave_if_config_present*
g:rustfmt_autosave_if_config_present ~
	Set this option to 1 to have *b:rustfmt_autosave* be set automatically
	if a `rustfmt.toml` file is present in any parent directly leading to
	the file being edited. If not set, default to 0: >vim
	    let g:rustfmt_autosave_if_config_present = 0
<
	This is useful to have `rustfmt` only execute on save, on projects
	that have `rustfmt.toml` configuration.

	There is also a buffer-local b:rustfmt_autosave_if_config_present
	that can be set for the same purpose, which can overrides the global
	setting.

						       *g:rustfmt_fail_silently*
g:rustfmt_fail_silently ~
	Set this option to 1 to prevent "rustfmt" from populating the
	|location-list| with errors. If not specified it defaults to 0: >vim
	    let g:rustfmt_fail_silently = 0
<
						       *g:rustfmt_options*
g:rustfmt_options ~
	Set this option to a string of options to pass to "rustfmt". The
	write-mode is already set to "overwrite". If not specified it
	defaults to '' : >vim
	    let g:rustfmt_options = ''
<
                                                       *g:rustfmt_emit_files*
g:rustfmt_emit_files ~
	If not specified rust.vim tries to detect the right parameter to
	pass to rustfmt based on its reported version. Otherwise, it
	determines whether to run rustfmt with '--emit=files' (when 1 is
	provided) instead of '--write-mode=overwrite'. >vim
	    let g:rustfmt_emit_files = 0
<

							  *g:rust_playpen_url*
g:rust_playpen_url ~
	Set this option to override the url for the playpen to use: >vim
	    let g:rust_playpen_url = 'https://play.rust-lang.org/'
<

							*g:rust_shortener_url*
g:rust_shortener_url ~
	Set this option to override the url for the url shortener: >vim
	    let g:rust_shortener_url = 'https://is.gd/'
<
                                                        *g:rust_clip_command*
g:rust_clip_command ~
	Set this option to the command used in your OS to copy the Rust Play
	url to the clipboard: >vim
	    let g:rust_clip_command = 'xclip -selection clipboard'
<

                                                       *g:cargo_makeprg_params*
g:cargo_makeprg_params ~
	Set this option to the string of parameters to pass to cargo. If not
	specified it defaults to `$*` : >vim
	    let g:cargo_makeprg_params = 'build'
<

                                                  *g:cargo_shell_command_runner*
g:cargo_shell_command_runner ~
	Set this option to change how to run shell commands for cargo commands
	|:Cargo|, |:Cbuild|, |:Crun|, ...
	By default, |:terminal| is used to run shell command in terminal window
	asynchronously. But if you prefer |:!| for running the commands, it can
	be specified: >vim
	    let g:cargo_shell_command_runner = '!'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Integration with Syntastic                                    *rust-syntastic*

This plugin automatically integrates with the Syntastic checker. There are two
checkers provided: `rustc`, and `cargo`. The latter invokes `cargo` in order to
build code, and the former delivers a single edited '.rs' file as a compilation
target directly to the Rust compiler, `rustc`.

Because Cargo is almost exclusively being used for building Rust code these
days, `cargo` is the default checker. >vim

    let g:syntastic_rust_checkers = ['cargo']
<
If you would like to change it, you can set `g:syntastic_rust_checkers` to a
different value.
                                          *g:rust_cargo_avoid_whole_workspace*
                                          *b:rust_cargo_avoid_whole_workspace*
g:rust_cargo_avoid_whole_workspace ~
	When editing a crate that is part of a Cargo workspace, and this
	option is set to 1 (the default), then `cargo` will be executed
	directly in that crate directory instead of in the workspace
	directory. Setting 0 prevents this behavior - however be aware that if
	you are working in large workspace, Cargo commands may take more time,
	plus the Syntastic error list may include all the crates in the
	workspace. >vim
            let g:rust_cargo_avoid_whole_workspace = 0
<
                                              *g:rust_cargo_check_all_targets*
                                              *b:rust_cargo_check_all_targets*
g:rust_cargo_check_all_targets ~
	When set to 1, the `--all-targets` option will be passed to cargo when
	Syntastic executes it, allowing the linting of all targets under the
	package.
	The default is 0.

                                              *g:rust_cargo_check_all_features*
                                              *b:rust_cargo_check_all_features*
g:rust_cargo_check_all_features ~
	When set to 1, the `--all-features` option will be passed to cargo when
	Syntastic executes it, allowing the linting of all features of the
	package.
	The default is 0.

                                                 *g:rust_cargo_check_examples*
                                                 *b:rust_cargo_check_examples*
g:rust_cargo_check_examples ~
	When set to 1, the `--examples` option will be passed to cargo when
	Syntastic executes it, to prevent the exclusion of examples from
	linting. The examples are normally under the `examples/` directory of
	the crate.
	The default is 0.

                                                    *g:rust_cargo_check_tests*
                                                    *b:rust_cargo_check_tests*
g:rust_cargo_check_tests ~
	When set to 1, the `--tests` option will be passed to cargo when
	Syntastic executes it, to prevent the exclusion of tests from linting.
	The tests are normally under the `tests/` directory of the crate.
	The default is 0.

                                                  *g:rust_cargo_check_benches*
                                                  *b:rust_cargo_check_benches*
g:rust_cargo_check_benches ~
	When set to 1, the `--benches` option will be passed to cargo when
	Syntastic executes it.  The benches are normally under the `benches/`
	directory of the crate.
	The default is 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Integration with auto-pairs                                    *rust-auto-pairs*

This plugin automatically configures the auto-pairs plugin not to duplicate
single quotes, which are used more often for lifetime annotations than for
single character literals.

                                                  *g:rust_keep_autopairs_default*
g:rust_keep_autopairs_default ~

	Don't override auto-pairs default for the Rust filetype. The default
	is 0.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                       *rust-commands*

Invoking Cargo ~

This plug defines very simple shortcuts for invoking Cargo from with Vim.

:Cargo <args>                                                       *:Cargo*
                Runs `cargo` with the provided arguments.

                Shortcut for `cargo clean` .

:Cdoc <args>                                                         *:Cdoc*
                Shortcut for `cargo doc` .

:Cinit <args>                                                       *:Cinit*
                Shortcut for `cargo init` .

:Crun <args>                                                         *:Crun*
                Shortcut for `cargo run` .

:Ctest <args>                                                       *:Ctest*
                Shortcut for `cargo test` .

                Shortcut for `cargo bench` .

:Csearch <args>                                                   *:Csearch*
                Shortcut for `cargo search` .

:Cpublish <args>                                                 *:Cpublish*
                Shortcut for `cargo publish` .

:Cinstall <args>                                                 *:Cinstall*

:Cruntarget <args>                                                 *:Cruntarget*
                Shortcut for `cargo run --bin` or `cargo run --example`,
                depending on the currently open buffer.

Formatting ~

:RustFmt                                                       *:RustFmt*
		Runs |g:rustfmt_command| on the current buffer. If
		|g:rustfmt_options| is set then those will be passed to the
		executable.

		If |g:rustfmt_fail_silently| is 0 (the default) then it
		will populate the |location-list| with the errors from
		|g:rustfmt_command|. If |g:rustfmt_fail_silently| is set to 1
		then it will not populate the |location-list|.

:RustFmtRange                                                  *:RustFmtRange*
		Runs |g:rustfmt_command| with selected range. See
		|:RustFmt| for any other information.


Playpen integration ~

:RustPlay                                                          *:RustPlay*
		This command will only work if you have web-api.vim installed
		(available at https://github.com/mattn/webapi-vim).  It sends the
		current selection, or if nothing is selected, the entirety of the
		current buffer to the Rust playpen, and emits a message with the
		shortened URL to the playpen.

		|g:rust_playpen_url| is the base URL to the playpen, by default
		"https://play.rust-lang.org/".

		|g:rust_shortener_url| is the base url for the shorterner, by
		default "https://is.gd/"

		|g:rust_clip_command| is the command to run to copy the
		playpen url to the clipboard of your system.


Evaluation of a single Rust file ~

NOTE: These commands are useful only when working with standalone Rust files,
which is usually not the case for common Rust development. If you wish to
building Rust crates from with Vim can should use Vim's make, Syntastic, or
functionality from other plugins.


:RustRun  [args]                                                    *:RustRun*
:RustRun! [rustc-args] [--] [args]
		Compiles and runs the current file. If it has unsaved changes,
		it will be saved first using |:update|. If the current file is
		an unnamed buffer, it will be written to a temporary file
		first. The compiled binary is always placed in a temporary
		directory, but is run from the current directory.

		The arguments given to |:RustRun| will be passed to the
		compiled binary.

		If ! is specified, the arguments are passed to rustc instead.
		A "--" argument will separate the rustc arguments from the
		arguments passed to the binary.

		If |g:rustc_path| is defined, it is used as the path to rustc.
		Otherwise it is assumed rustc can be found in $PATH.

:RustExpand  [args]                                              *:RustExpand*
:RustExpand! [TYPE] [args]
		Expands the current file using `--pretty` and displays the
		results in a new split. If the current file has unsaved
		changes, it will be saved first using |:update|. If the
		current file is an unnamed buffer, it will be written to a
		temporary file first.

		The arguments given to |:RustExpand| will be passed to rustc.
		This is largely intended for specifying various `--cfg`
		configurations.

		If ! is specified, the first argument is the expansion type to
		pass to `rustc --pretty` . Otherwise it will default to
		"expanded".

		If |g:rustc_path| is defined, it is used as the path to rustc.
		Otherwise it is assumed rustc can be found in $PATH.

:RustEmitIr [args]                                               *:RustEmitIr*
		Compiles the current file to LLVM IR and displays the results
		in a new split. If the current file has unsaved changes, it
		will be saved first using |:update|. If the current file is an
		unnamed buffer, it will be written to a temporary file first.

		The arguments given to |:RustEmitIr| will be passed to rustc.

		If |g:rustc_path| is defined, it is used as the path to rustc.
		Otherwise it is assumed rustc can be found in $PATH.

:RustEmitAsm [args]                                             *:RustEmitAsm*
		Compiles the current file to assembly and displays the results
		in a new split. If the current file has unsaved changes, it
		will be saved first using |:update|. If the current file is an
		unnamed buffer, it will be written to a temporary file first.

		The arguments given to |:RustEmitAsm| will be passed to rustc.

		If |g:rustc_path| is defined, it is used as the path to rustc.
		Otherwise it is assumed rustc can be found in $PATH.


Running test(s) ~

:[N]RustTest[!] [options]                                       *:RustTest*
		Runs a test under the cursor when the current buffer is in a
		cargo project with "cargo test" command. If the command did
		not find any test function under the cursor, it stops with an
		error message.

		When N is given, adjust the size of the new window to N lines
		or columns.

		When ! is given, runs all tests regardless of current cursor
		position.

		When [options] is given, it is passed to "cargo" command
		arguments.

		When the current buffer is outside cargo project, the command
		runs `rustc --test` command instead of "cargo test" as
		fallback. All tests are run regardless of adding ! since there
		is no way to run specific test function with rustc. [options]
		is passed to `rustc` command arguments in the case.

		Takes optional modifiers (see |<mods>|):  >vim
		    :tab RustTest
		    :belowright 16RustTest
		    :leftabove vert 80RustTest
