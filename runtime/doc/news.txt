==============================================================================
BREAKING CHANGES IN HEAD OR EXPERIMENTAL                    *news-breaking-dev*

              ====== Remove this section before release. ======

The following changes to UNRELEASED features were made during the development
cycle (Nvim HEAD, the "master" branch).

EXPERIMENTS

• Removed `vim.loader.disable()`. Use `vim.loader.enable(false)` instead.

LSP

• `lsp/` runtimepath files should return a table instead of calling
  |vim.lsp.config()| (or assigning to `vim.lsp.config`). See |lsp-config|
• `vim.lsp.buf.document_symbol()` uses the |location-list| by default. Use
  `vim.lsp.buf.document_symbol({ loclist = false })` to use the |quickfix|
  list.


OPTIONS

• 'jumpoptions' flag "unload" has been renamed to "clean".
• The `msghistory` option has been removed in favor of 'messagesopt'.

TREESITTER

• *TSNode:child_containing_descendant()* has been removed in the tree-sitter
  library and is no longer available; use |TSNode:child_with_descendant()|
  instead.

==============================================================================
BREAKING CHANGES                                                *news-breaking*

These changes may require adaptations in your config or plugins.

API

• `vim.rpcnotify(0)` and `rpcnotify(0)` broadcast to ALL channels. Previously
  they would "multicast" only to subscribed channels (controlled by
  `nvim_subscribe()`). Plugins and clients that want "multicast" behavior must
  now maintain their own list of channels.
  • In the future, |vim.rpcnotify()| may accept a list of channels, if there
    is demand for this use-case.
• "Dictionary" was renamed to "Dict" internally and in the RPC |api-metadata|.
  This is not expected to break clients because there are no known clients
  that actually use the `return_type` field or the parameter type names
  reported by |--api-info| or |nvim_get_api_info()|.
• |nvim_open_win()| supports a `mouse` field that allows configuring mouse
  interaction with the window separately from `focusable` field.
• Renamed `nvim__id_dictionary` (unsupported/experimental API) to
  `nvim__id_dict`.

BUILD

On Windows, only building with the UCRT runtime is supported.

DEFAULTS

• 'number', 'relativenumber', 'signcolumn', and 'foldcolumn' are disabled in
  |terminal| buffers. See |terminal-config| for an example of changing these defaults.
• 'diffopt' default includes "linematch:40".

DIAGNOSTICS

• The "underline" diagnostics handler sorts diagnostics by severity when using
  the "severity_sort" option.
• Diagnostics are filtered by severity before being passed to a diagnostic
  handler |diagnostic-handlers|.
• The "virtual_text" handler is disabled by default. Enable with >lua
    vim.diagnostic.config({ virtual_text = true })
<
EDITOR

• The order in which signs are placed was changed. Higher priority signs will
  now appear left of lower priority signs.
• |hl-CurSearch| now behaves the same as Vim and no longer updates on every
  cursor movement.
• Moving in the buffer list using |:bnext| and similar commands behaves as
  documented and skips help buffers if run from a non-help buffer, otherwise
  it moves to another help buffer.
• Bells from a |terminal| buffer are now silent by default, unless 'belloff'
  option doesn't contain "term" or "all".

EVENTS

• |vim.ui_attach()| callbacks for |ui-messages| `msg_show` events are executed in
  |api-fast| context.
• New/enhanced arguments in these existing UI events:
  • `cmdline_hide`: `abort` argument indicating if the cmdline was aborted.
  • `cmdline_show`:
    • Prompts that were previously emitted as `msg_show` events, are now routed
      through `cmdline_show`.
    • `hl_id` argument to highlight the prompt text.
  • `msg_show`:
    • `history` argument indicating if the message was added to the history.
    • new message kinds: "bufwrite", "completion", "list_cmd", "lua_print",
      "search_cmd", "shell_out/err/ret", "undo", "verbose", wildlist".

HIGHLIGHTS

• |TermCursorNC| is removed and no longer supported. Unfocused terminals no
  longer have a cursor.

LSP

• |vim.lsp.buf.references()|, |vim.lsp.buf.declaration()|, |vim.lsp.buf.definition()|,
  |vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()|, |vim.lsp.buf.implementation()| and
  |vim.lsp.buf.hover()| now support merging the results of multiple clients
  but no longer trigger the global handlers from `vim.lsp.handlers`
• |vim.lsp.buf.typehierarchy()| now passes the correct params for each
  client request.
• |vim.lsp.handlers.signature_help()| is no longer used.
• |vim.lsp.diagnostic.on_publish_diagnostics()| and
  |vim.lsp.diagnostic.on_diagnostic()| no longer accept a config parameter and
  can no longer be configured with |vim.lsp.with()|.
  Instead use: >lua
    vim.diagnostic.config(config, vim.lsp.diagnostic.get_namespace(client_id))
<
• |vim.lsp.util.make_position_params()|, |vim.lsp.util.make_range_params()|
  and |vim.lsp.util.make_given_range_params()| now require the `position_encoding`
  parameter.
• |vim.lsp.util.symbols_to_items()| now requires the `position_encoding` parameter.

LUA

• API functions now consistently return an empty dictionary as
  |vim.empty_dict()|. Earlier, a |lua-special-tbl| was sometimes used.
• |vim.json.encode()| no longer escapes forward slashes "/" by default

OPTIONS

• The 'statuscolumn' `%l` item can now be used as a number column segment that
  changes according to related options. It takes care of alignment, 'number',
  'relativenumber' and 'signcolumn' set to "number". The now redundant `%r` item
  is no longer treated specially for 'statuscolumn'.
• `:set {option}<` removes the local value for all |global-local| options instead
  of just string |global-local| options.
• `:setlocal {option}<` copies the global value to the local value for number
  and boolean |global-local| options instead of removing the local value.
• Setting |hidden-options| now gives an error. In particular, setting
  'noshellslash' is now only allowed on Windows.

PLUGINS

• TODO

TREESITTER

• |Query:iter_matches()| correctly returns all matching nodes in a match
  instead of only the last node. This means that the returned table maps
  capture IDs to a list of nodes that need to be iterated over. For
  backwards compatibility, an option `all=false` (only return the last
  matching node) is provided that will be removed in a future release.
• |vim.treesitter.language.get_filetypes()| always includes the {language}
  argument in addition to explicitly registered filetypes.
• |vim.treesitter.language.get_lang()| falls back to the {filetype} argument
  if no languages are explicitly registered.
• |vim.treesitter.language.add()| returns `true` if a parser was loaded
  successfully and `nil,errmsg` otherwise instead of throwing an error.
• |vim.treesitter.get_parser()| and |vim.treesitter.start()| no longer parse
  the tree before returning. Scripts must call |LanguageTree:parse()| explicitly. >lua
    local p = vim.treesitter.get_parser(0, 'c')
    p:parse()
• |vim.treesitter.get_parser()| expects its buffer to be loaded.
<

TUI

• OSC 52 is used as a fallback clipboard provider when no other
  |clipboard-tool| is found, even when not using SSH |clipboard-osc52|. To
  disable OSC 52 queries, set the "osc52" key of |g:termfeatures| to false.

VIMSCRIPT

• |v:msgpack_types| has the type "binary" removed. |msgpackparse()| no longer
  treats BIN, STR and FIXSTR as separate types. Any of these is returned as a
  string if possible, or a |blob| if the value contained embedded NUL:s.

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES                                                    *news-features*

• Additions to |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|:
  • `conceal_lines` field to conceal an entire line.
  • `hl_group` field can be an array of layered groups.
  • `virt_text_pos` field accepts value `eol_right_align` to allow for right
    aligned text that truncates before covering up buffer text.

    "Configure Diagnostics" items when there are diagnostics in the buffer.
  • |]d-default| and |[d-default| accept a count.
  • |[D-default| and |]D-default| jump to the first and last diagnostic in the
    current buffer, respectively.
  • Mappings inspired by Tim Pope's vim-unimpaired:
    • |[q|, |]q|, |[Q|, |]Q|, |[CTRL-Q|, |]CTRL-Q| navigate through the |quickfix| list
    • |[l|, |]l|, |[L|, |]L|, |[CTRL-L|, |]CTRL-L| navigate through the |location-list|

    when a snippet is active and jumpable forwards.
  • `<S-Tab>` in Insert and Select mode maps to `vim.snippet.jump({ direction = -1 })`
    when a snippet is active and jumpable backwards.

DIAGNOSTICS

  |vim.diagnostic.jump()|.
• A "virtual_lines" diagnostic handler was added to render diagnostics using
  virtual lines below the respective code.
• The "virtual_text" diagnostic handler accepts a `current_line` option to
  only show virtual text at the cursor's line.

EDITOR

• Use |g==| in :help docs to execute Lua and Vimscript code examples.
• Improved |paste| handling for redo (dot-repeat) and macros (|recording|):
  • Redoing a large paste is significantly faster and ignores 'autoindent'.
  • Replaying a macro with |@| also replays pasted text.
• On Windows, filename arguments on the command-line prefixed with "~\" or
  "~/" are now expanded to the user's profile directory, not a relative path
  to a literal "~" directory.
• |hl-ComplMatchIns| shows matched text of the currently inserted completion.
• |hl-PmenuMatch| and |hl-PmenuMatchSel| show matched text in completion popup.
• |gO| now works in `help`, `checkhealth`, and `markdown` buffers.
• Jump between sections in `help` and `checkhealth` buffers with `[[` and
  `]]`.

EVENTS

• |CompleteDone| now sets the `reason` key in `v:event` which specifies the reason
  for completion being done.
• |vim.on_key()| callbacks can consume the key by returning an empty string.

LSP

• Improved rendering of LSP hover docs. |K-lsp-default|
• |vim.lsp.completion.enable()| gained the `convert` callback which enables
  customizing the transformation of an LSP CompletionItem to |complete-items|.
• |vim.lsp.diagnostic.from()| can be used to convert a list of
  |vim.Diagnostic| objects into their LSP diagnostic representation.
• `:checkhealth vim.lsp` displays the server version (if available).
• Completion side effects (including snippet expansion, execution of commands
  and application of additional text edits) is now built-in.
• |vim.lsp.util.locations_to_items()| and |vim.lsp.util.symbols_to_items()| now
  sets `end_col` and `end_lnum` fields.
• |vim.lsp.buf.format()| now supports passing a list of ranges
  via the `range` parameter (this requires support for the
  `textDocument/rangesFormatting` request).
• |vim.lsp.buf.code_action()| actions show client name when there are multiple
  clients.
• |vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()| can now cycle through different signatures
  using `<C-s>` and also support multiple clients.
• The client now supports `'utf-8'` and `'utf-32'` position encodings.
• |vim.lsp.buf.hover()| now highlights hover ranges using the
  |hl-LspReferenceTarget| highlight group.
• Functions in |vim.lsp.Client| can now be called as methods.
• Implemented LSP folding: |vim.lsp.foldexpr()|
  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_foldingRange
• |vim.lsp.config()| has been added to define default configurations for
  servers. In addition, configurations can be specified in `lsp/<name>.lua`.
• |vim.lsp.enable()| has been added to enable servers.

LUA

• Command-line completions for: `vim.g`, `vim.t`, `vim.w`, `vim.b`, `vim.v`,
  `vim.o`, `vim.wo`, `vim.bo`, `vim.opt`, `vim.opt_local`, `vim.opt_global`,
  and `vim.fn`.
• Documentation for |lua-bit|.
• |vim.fs.rm()| can delete files and directories.
• |vim.validate()| now has a new signature which uses less tables,
  is more performant and easier to read.
• |vim.str_byteindex()| and |vim.str_utfindex()| gained overload signatures
  supporting two new parameters, `encoding` and `strict_indexing`.
• |vim.json.encode()| has an option to enable forward slash escaping
• |vim.fs.abspath()| converts paths to absolute paths.
• |vim.fs.relpath()| gets relative path compared to base path.
• |vim.fs.dir()| and |vim.fs.find()| now follow symbolic links by default,
  the behavior can be turn off using the new `follow` option.

OPTIONS

• 'completeopt' flag "fuzzy" enables |fuzzy-matching| during |ins-completion|.
• 'completeopt' flag "preinsert" highlights text to be inserted.
• 'messagesopt' configures |:messages| and |hit-enter| prompt.
• 'tabclose' controls which tab page to focus when closing a tab page.
• 'eventignorewin' to persistently ignore events in a window.

PERFORMANCE

• Significantly reduced redraw time for long lines with treesitter
  highlighting.
• LSP diagnostics and inlay hints are de-duplicated (new requests cancel
  inflight requests). This greatly improves performance with slow LSP servers.
• 10x speedup for |vim.treesitter.foldexpr()| (when no parser exists for the
  buffer).
• Strong |treesitter-query| caching makes repeat  |vim.treesitter.query.get()|
  and |vim.treesitter.query.parse()| calls significantly faster for large
  queries.
• Treesitter highlighting is now asynchronous. To force synchronous parsing,
  use `vim.g._ts_force_sync_parsing = true`.
• Treesitter folding is now calculated asynchronously.
• |LanguageTree:parse()| now only runs the injection query on the provided
  range (as long as the language does not have a combined injection),
  significantly improving |treesitter-highlight| performance.
• Treesitter injection query iteration is now asynchronous, making edits in
  large buffers with combined injections much quicker.

PLUGINS

• EditorConfig
  • spelling_language property is now supported.
• 'inccommand' incremental preview can run on 'nomodifiable' buffers and
  restores their 'modifiable' state

STARTUP

• |-es| ("script mode") disables shada by default.
• Nvim will fail if the |--listen| or |$NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS| address is
  invalid, instead of silently skipping an invalid address.

TERMINAL

• The |terminal| now understands the OSC 52 escape sequence to write to the
  system clipboard (copy). Querying with OSC 52 (paste) is not supported.
• |hl-StatusLineTerm| and |hl-StatusLineTermNC| define highlights for the
  status line in |terminal| windows.
• The terminal buffer now supports reflow (wrapped lines adapt when the buffer
  is resized horizontally). Note: Lines that are not visible and kept in
  'scrollback' are not reflown.
• The |terminal| now supports OSC 8 escape sequences and will display
  hyperlinks in supporting host terminals.
• The |terminal| now uses the actual cursor, rather than a "virtual" cursor.
  This means that escape codes sent by applications running in a terminal
  buffer can change the cursor shape and visibility. However, it also
  means that the |TermCursorNC| highlight group is no longer supported: an
  unfocused terminal window will have no cursor at all (so there is nothing to
  highlight).
• |jobstart()| gained the "term" flag.
• The |terminal| will send theme update notifications when 'background' is
  changed and DEC mode 2031 is enabled.
• The |terminal| has experimental support for the Kitty keyboard protocol
  (sometimes called "CSI u" key encoding). Only the "Disambiguate escape
  codes" mode is currently supported.
• The |terminal| emits a |TermRequest| autocommand event when the child process
  emits an APC control sequence.

TREESITTER

• |LanguageTree:node_for_range()| gets anonymous and named nodes for a range
• |vim.treesitter.get_node()| now takes an option `include_anonymous`, default
  false, which allows it to return anonymous nodes as well as named nodes.
• |treesitter-directive-trim!| can trim all whitespace (not just empty lines)
  from both sides of a node.
• |vim.treesitter.get_captures_at_pos()| now returns the `id` of each capture
• New |TSNode:child_with_descendant()|, which efficiently gets the node's
  child that contains a given node as descendant.
• |LanguageTree:parse()| optionally supports asynchronous invocation, which is
  activated by passing the `on_parse` callback parameter.
• |vim.treesitter.query.set()| can now inherit and/or extend runtime file
  queries in addition to overriding.
• |LanguageTree:is_valid()| now accepts a range parameter to narrow the scope
  of the validity check.
• |:InspectTree| now shows which nodes are missing.
• Bundled markdown highlight queries use `conceal_lines` metadata to conceal
  code block fence lines vertically.

TUI

• The builtin UI declares info |nvim_set_client_info()| on its channel. See
  |startup-tui|. To see the current UI info, try this: >
    :lua =vim.api.nvim_get_chan_info(vim.api.nvim_list_uis()[1].chan)
• |log| messages written by the builtin UI client (TUI, |--remote-ui|) are
  now prefixed with "ui" instead of "?".
• The TUI will re-query the terminal's background color when a theme update
  notification is received and Nvim will update 'background' accordingly.

UI

• |:detach| the current UI, let the Nvim server continue running as a background
  process. Works with the builtin TUI, and all GUIs.
• |vim.ui.open()| (by default bound to |gx|) accepts an `opt.cmd` parameter
  which controls the tool used to open the given path or URL. If you want to
  globally set this, you can override vim.ui.open using the same approach
  described at |vim.paste()|.
• `vim.ui.open()` now supports
  [lemonade](https://github.com/lemonade-command/lemonade) as an option for
  opening urls/files. This is handy if you are in an ssh connection and use
  `lemonade`.
• The |ins-completion-menu| now supports cascading highlight styles.
  |hl-PmenuSel| and |hl-PmenuMatch| both inherit from |hl-Pmenu|, and
  |hl-PmenuMatchSel| inherits highlights from both |hl-PmenuSel| and
  |hl-PmenuMatch|.
• |vim.diagnostic.setqflist()| updates an existing quickfix list with the
  given title if found
• |ui-messages| content chunks now also contain the highlight group ID.
• |:checkhealth| can display in a floating window, controlled by the
  |g:health| variable.

VIMSCRIPT

• |getchar()| and |getcharstr()| have optional {opts} |Dict| argument to control:
  cursor behavior, return type, and whether to simplify the returned key.

==============================================================================
CHANGED FEATURES                                                 *news-changed*

These existing features changed their behavior.

• 'scrollbind' now works properly with buffers that contain virtual lines.

  Scrollbind works by aligning to a target top line of each window in a tab
  page. Previously this was done by calculating the difference between the old
  top line and the target top line, and scrolling by that amount. Now the
  top lines are calculated using screen line numbers which take virtual lines
  into account.

• The implementation of grapheme clusters (or combining chars |mbyte-combining|)
  was upgraded to closely follow extended grapheme clusters as defined by UAX#29
  in the unicode standard. Noteworthily, this enables proper display of many
  more emoji characters than before, including those encoded with multiple
  emoji codepoints combined with ZWJ (zero width joiner) codepoints.

  This also applies to :terminal output, where width of cells will be calculated
  using the upgraded implementation.

• Custom highlights in 'rulerformat', 'statuscolumn', 'statusline', 'tabline',
  'winbar', and the sign/number column are stacked with their respective
  highlight groups, as opposed to |hl-Normal|.
  This is also reflected in the `highlights` from |nvim_eval_statusline()|,
  with a new `groups` field containing an array of stacked highlight groups.

• |vim.on_key()| callbacks won't be invoked recursively when a callback itself
  consumes input.

• "q" in man pages now uses |CTRL-W_q| instead of |CTRL-W_c| to close the
  current window, and it no longer throws |E444| when there is only one window
  on the screen. Global variable `vim.g.pager` is removed.

• Default 'titlestring' is now implemented with 'statusline' "%" format items.
  This means the default, empty value is essentially an alias to:
  `%t%(\ %M%)%(\ \(%{expand(\"%:~:h\")}\)%)%a\ -\ Nvim`. This is only an
  implementation simplification, not a behavior change.
