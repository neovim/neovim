BREAKING CHANGES IN HEAD                                    *news-breaking-dev*

              ====== Remove this section before release. ======

The following changes to UNRELEASED features were made during the development
cycle (Nvim HEAD, the "master" branch).

==============================================================================
BREAKING CHANGES                                                *news-breaking*

These changes may require adaptations in your config or plugins.

API

• `vim.rpcnotify(0)` and `rpcnotify(0)` broadcast to ALL channels. Previously
  they would "multicast" only to subscribed channels (controlled by
  `nvim_subscribe()`). Plugins and clients that want "multicast" behavior must
  now maintain their own list of channels.
  • In the future, |vim.rpcnotify()| may accept a list of channels, if there
    is demand for this use-case.

DEFAULTS

• |]d-default| and |[d-default| accept a count.
• |[D-default| and |]D-default| jump to the first and last diagnostic in the
  current buffer, respectively.

DIAGNOSTICS

• |vim.diagnostic.config()| accepts a "jump" table to specify defaults for
  |vim.diagnostic.jump()|.

EDITOR

• The order in which signs are placed was changed. Higher priority signs will
  now appear left of lower priority signs.
