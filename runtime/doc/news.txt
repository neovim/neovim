The following changes to UNRELEASED features were made during the development
cycle (Nvim HEAD, the "master" branch).

EVENTS

• Renamed "nvim.find_exrc" |default-autocmds| group to "nvim.exrc".

EXPERIMENTS

• todo

LSP

• |vim.lsp.buf.selection_range()| now accepts an integer which specifies its
  direction, rather than a string `'outer'` or `'inner'`.

OPTIONS

UI

• `progress` attribute removed form |ui-messages| msg_show event


==============================================================================
BREAKING CHANGES                                                *news-breaking*

These changes may require adaptations in your config or plugins.

API

• Decoration provider has `on_range()` callback.

BUILD

• todo

DIAGNOSTICS

• |diagnostic-signs| can no longer be configured with |:sign-define| or
  |sign_define()| (deprecated in Nvim 0.10 |deprecated-0.10|).
• |vim.diagnostic.disable()| and |vim.diagnostic.is_disabled()| (deprecated in
  Nvim 0.10 |deprecated-0.10|) are removed.
• The legacy signature of |vim.diagnostic.enable()| (deprecated in Nvim 0.10
  |deprecated-0.10|) is no longer supported.

EDITOR

- |i_CTRL-R| inserts named/clipboard registers (A-Z,a-z,0-9+) literally, like
  pasting instead of like user input. Improves performance, avoids broken
  formatting. To get the old behavior you can use `<C-R>=@x`.

EVENTS

• |ui-messages| no longer emits the `msg_show.return_prompt`, and
  `msg_history_clear` events. The `msg_clear` event was repurposed and is now
  emitted after the screen is cleared. These events arbitrarily assumed a
  message UI that mimicks the legacy message grid. Benefit: reduced UI event
  traffic and more flexibility for UIs.
  The `msg_history_show` event has an additional "prev_cmd" argument.
• A new `empty` message kind is emitted for an empty (e.g. `:echo ""`) message.

HIGHLIGHTS

• todo

LSP

• `root_markers` in |vim.lsp.Config| can now be ordered by priority.
• The function set with |vim.lsp.log.set_format_func()| is now given all
  arguments corresponding to a log entry instead of the individual arguments.
• `vim.lsp.semantic_tokens.start/stop` now renamed to
  `vim.lsp.semantic_tokens.enable`
• Missing fields in LSP messages are now represented using |vim.NIL| instead of nil.
• |vim.lsp.util.convert_signature_help_to_markdown_lines()| activeParameter
  handling updated:
    • Values < 0 are now treated as `nil` instead of 0.
    • Values outside the range of `signatures[activeSignature].parameters`
      are now treated as `nil` instead of `#signatures[activeSignature].parameters`

LUA

• Renamed `vim.diff` to `vim.text.diff`.
• |vim.net.request()| adds a minimal HTTP GET API using curl.

OPTIONS

• 'shelltemp' defaults to "false".

PLUGINS

• todo

TREESITTER

• |treesitter-directive-offset!| can now be applied to quantified captures. It
  no longer sets `metadata[capture_id].range`; it instead sets
  `metadata[capture_id].offset`. The offset will be applied in
  |vim.treesitter.get_range()|, which should be preferred over reading
  metadata directly for retrieving node ranges.
• |Query:iter_captures()| supports specifying starting and ending columns.

TUI

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES                                                    *news-features*

The following new features were added.

API

• |api-contract| allows existing functions to change return-type from `void =>
  non-void`.
• |nvim_win_text_height()| can limit the lines checked when a certain
  `max_height` is reached, and returns the `end_row` and `end_vcol` for which
  `max_height` or the calculated height is reached.
• |vim.secure.read()| now returns `true` for trusted directories. Previously
  it would return `nil`, which made it impossible to tell if the directory was
  actually trusted.
• Added |vim.lsp.is_enabled()| to check if a given LSP config has been enabled
  by |vim.lsp.enable()|.
• |nvim_ui_send()| writes arbitrary data to a UI's stdout. Use this to write
  escape sequences to the terminal when Nvim is running in the |TUI|.
• |nvim_echo()| can set the |ui-messages| kind with which to emit the message.
• |nvim_echo()| can create |Progress| messages

BUILD

• A Zig-based build system has been added as an alternative to CMake. It is
  currently limited in functionality, and CMake remains the recommended option
  for the time being.

DEFAULTS

• 'statusline' default is exposed as a statusline expression (previously it
  was implemented as an internal C routine).
• 'statusline' includes |vim.diagnostic.status()|
• Project-local configuration ('exrc') is also loaded from parent directories.
  Unset 'exrc' to stop further search.
• Mappings:
  • |grt| in Normal mode maps to |vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()|

DIAGNOSTICS

• |vim.diagnostic.setloclist()| and |vim.diagnostic.setqflist()| now support a
  `format` function to modify (or filter) diagnostics before being set in the
  location/quickfix list.
• |vim.diagnostic.get()| now accepts an `enabled` filter to only return
  enabled or disabled diagnostics.
• |vim.diagnostic.status()| returns a formatted string with current buffer
  diagnostics

EDITOR

• |:iput| works like |:put| but adjusts indent.
• |:retab| accepts new optional parameter -indentonly to only change leading
  whitespace in indented lines.
• |:uniq| deduplicates text in the current buffer.
• |omnicompletion| in `help` buffer. |ft-help-omni|
• Setting "'0" in 'shada' prevents storing the jumplist in the shada file.
• 'shada' now correctly respects "/0" and "f0".
• |prompt-buffer| supports multiline input/paste, undo/redo, and o/O normal
  commands.
• 'wildchar' now enables completion in search contexts using |/|, |?|, |:g|, |:v|
   and |:vimgrep| commands.
• For security, 'exrc' no longer shows an "(a)llow" choice. Instead you must
  "(v)iew" then run `:trust`.

EVENTS

• |CmdlineLeave| sets |v:char| to the character that stops the Cmdline mode.
• |CmdlineLeavePre| triggered before preparing to leave the command line.
• New `append` paremeter for |ui-messages| `msg_show` event.
• New `msg_id` paremeter for |ui-messages| `msg_show` event.
• Creating or updating a progress message with |nvim_echo()| triggers a |Progress| event.

HIGHLIGHTS

• |hl-DiffTextAdd| highlights added text within a changed line.
• |hl-OkMsg| |hl-StderrMsg| |hl-StdoutMsg|
• |hl-SnippetTabstopActive| highlights the currently active tabstop.

LSP

• |vim.lsp.ClientConfig| gained `workspace_required`.
• You can control priority of |vim.lsp.Config| `root_markers`.
• Support for `textDocument/documentColor`: |lsp-document_color|
  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_documentColor

  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_colorPresentation
• The `textDocument/diagnostic` request now includes the previous id in its
  parameters.
• |vim.lsp.enable()| start/stops clients as necessary. And detaches
  non-applicable LSP clients.
• |vim.lsp.is_enabled()| checks if a LSP config is enabled (without
  "resolving" it).
• Support for `workspace/diagnostic`: |vim.lsp.buf.workspace_diagnostics()|
  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#workspace_dagnostics
• Incremental selection is now supported via `textDocument/selectionRange`.
  `an` selects outwards and `in` selects inwards.
• Support for multiline semantic tokens.
• Support for the `disabled` field on code actions.
• The function form of `cmd` in a vim.lsp.Config or vim.lsp.ClientConfig
  receives the resolved config as the second arg: `cmd(dispatchers, config)`.
• Support for annotated text edits.
• `:checkhealth vim.lsp` is now available to check which buffers the active LSP features are attached to.
• LSP `DiagnosticRelatedInformation` is now shown in
  |vim.diagnostic.open_float()|. It is read from the LSP diagnostic object
  stored in the `user_data` field.
• When inside the float created by |vim.diagnostic.open_float()| and the
  cursor is on a line with `DiagnosticRelatedInformation`, |gf| can be used to
  jump to the problematic location.
• Support for `textDocument/linkedEditingRange`: |lsp-linked_editing_range|

• 'busy' sets a buffer "busy" status. Indicated in the default statusline.

PERFORMANCE

• |vim.glob.to_lpeg()| uses a new LPeg-based implementation (Peglob) that
  provides ~50% speedup for complex patterns. The implementation restores
  support for nested braces and follows LSP 3.17 specification with
  additional constraints for improved correctness and resistance to
  backtracking edge cases.
- |i_CTRL-R| inserts named/clipboard registers literally, 10x speedup.

PLUGINS
