BREAKING CHANGES IN HEAD OR EXPERIMENTAL                    *news-breaking-dev*

              ====== Remove this section before release. ======

The following changes to UNRELEASED features were made during the development
cycle (Nvim HEAD, the "master" branch).

EVENTS

• Renamed "nvim.find_exrc" |default-autocmds| group to "nvim.exrc".

EXPERIMENTS

• todo

LSP

• |vim.lsp.buf.selection_range()| now accepts an integer which specifies its
  direction, rather than a string `'outer'` or `'inner'`.

BREAKING CHANGES                                                *news-breaking*

These changes may require adaptations in your config or plugins.

API

• todo

BUILD

• todo

DIAGNOSTICS

• |diagnostic-signs| can no longer be configured with |:sign-define| or
  |sign_define()| (deprecated in Nvim 0.10 |deprecated-0.10|).
• |vim.diagnostic.disable()| and |vim.diagnostic.is_disabled()| (deprecated in
  Nvim 0.10 |deprecated-0.10|) are removed.
• The legacy signature of |vim.diagnostic.enable()| (deprecated in Nvim 0.10
  |deprecated-0.10|) is no longer supported.

EDITOR

• todo

EVENTS

• |ui-messages| no longer emits the `msg_show.return_prompt`, and
  `msg_history_clear` events. The `msg_clear` event was repurposed and is now
  emitted after the screen is cleared. These events arbitrarily assumed a
  message UI that mimicks the legacy message grid. Benefit: reduced UI event
  traffic and more flexibility for UIs.
  The `msg_history_show` event has an additional "prev_cmd" argument.
• A new `empty` message kind is emitted for an empty (e.g. `:echo ""`) message.

HIGHLIGHTS

• todo

LSP

• `root_markers` in |vim.lsp.Config| can now be ordered by priority.
• The function set with |vim.lsp.log.set_format_func()| is now given all
  arguments corresponding to a log entry instead of the individual arguments.

LUA

• todo

OPTIONS

• 'shelltemp' defaults to "false".

PLUGINS

• todo

TREESITTER

• |treesitter-directive-offset!| can now be applied to quantified captures. It
  no longer sets `metadata[capture_id].range`; it instead sets
  `metadata[capture_id].offset`. The offset will be applied in
  |vim.treesitter.get_range()|, which should be preferred over reading
  metadata directly for retrieving node ranges.

NEW FEATURES                                                    *news-features*

The following new features were added.

API

• |api-contract| allows existing functions to change return-type from `void =>
  non-void`.
• |nvim_win_text_height()| can limit the lines checked when a certain
  `max_height` is reached, and returns the `end_row` and `end_vcol` for which
  `max_height` or the calculated height is reached.
• |vim.secure.read()| now returns `true` for trusted directories. Previously
  it would return `nil`, which made it impossible to tell if the directory was
  actually trusted.
• Added |vim.lsp.is_enabled()| to check if a given LSP config has been enabled
  by |vim.lsp.enable()|.
• |nvim_echo()| can set the |ui-messages| kind with which to emit the message.

BUILD

• A Zig-based build system has been added as an alternative to CMake. It is
  currently limited in functionality, and CMake remains the recommended option
  for the time being.

DEFAULTS

• 'statusline' default is exposed as a statusline expression (previously it
  was implemented as an internal C routine).
• Project-local configuration ('exrc') is also loaded from parent directories.
  Unset 'exrc' to stop further search.
• Mappings:
  • |grt| in Normal mode maps to |vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()|

DIAGNOSTICS

• |vim.diagnostic.setloclist()| and |vim.diagnostic.setqflist()| now support a
  `format` function to modify (or filter) diagnostics before being set in the
  location/quickfix list.
• |vim.diagnostic.get()| now accepts an `enabled` filter to only return
  enabled or disabled diagnostics.

EDITOR

• |:iput| works like |:put| but adjusts indent.
• |:uniq| deduplicates text in the current buffer.
• |omnicompletion| in `help` buffer. |ft-help-omni|
• Setting "'0" in 'shada' prevents storing the jumplist in the shada file.
• 'shada' now correctly respects "/0" and "f0".
• |prompt-buffer| supports multiline input/paste, undo/redo, and o/O normal
  commands.
• 'wildchar' now enables completion in search contexts using |/|, |?|, |:g|, |:v|
   and |:vimgrep| commands.

EVENTS

• |CmdlineLeavePre| triggered before preparing to leave the command line.
• New `append` paremeter for |ui-messages| `msg_show` event.

HIGHLIGHTS

• |hl-DiffTextAdd| highlights added text within a changed line.
• |hl-StderrMsg| |hl-StdoutMsg|

LSP

• |vim.lsp.ClientConfig| gained `workspace_required`.
• You can control priority of |vim.lsp.Config| `root_markers`.
• Support for `textDocument/documentColor`: |lsp-document_color|
  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_documentColor
• The `textDocument/diagnostic` request now includes the previous id in its
  parameters.
• |vim.lsp.enable()| start/stops clients as necessary. And detaches
  non-applicable LSP clients.
• |vim.lsp.is_enabled()| checks if a LSP config is enabled (without
  "resolving" it).
• Support for `workspace/diagnostic`: |vim.lsp.buf.workspace_diagnostics()|
  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#workspace_dagnostics
• Incremental selection is now supported via `textDocument/selectionRange`.
  `an` selects outwards and `in` selects inwards.
• Support for multiline semantic tokens.
• Support for the `disabled` field on code actions.
• The function form of `cmd` in a vim.lsp.Config or vim.lsp.ClientConfig
  receives the resolved config as the second arg: `cmd(dispatchers, config)`.
• Support for annotated text edits.
• `:checkhealth vim.lsp` is now available to check which buffers the active LSP features are attached to.
• LSP `DiagnosticRelatedInformation` is now shown in
  |vim.diagnostic.open_float()|. It is read from the LSP diagnostic object
  stored in the `user_data` field.

LUA

• Lua type annotations for `vim.uv`.
• |vim.hl.range()| now allows multiple timed highlights.
• |vim.tbl_extend()| and |vim.tbl_deep_extend()| now accept a function behavior argument.
• |vim.fs.root()| can define "equal priority" via nested lists.
• |vim.version.range()| output can be converted to human-readable string with |tostring()|.
• |vim.version.intersect()| computes intersection of two version ranges.
• |Iter:take()| and |Iter:skip()| now optionally accept predicates.
• Built-in plugin manager |vim.pack|

OPTIONS

• 'autowriteall' writes all buffers upon receiving `SIGHUP`, `SIGQUIT` or `SIGTSTP`.
• 'chistory' and 'lhistory' set size of the |quickfix-stack|.
• 'completefuzzycollect' enables fuzzy collection of candidates for (some)
  |ins-completion| modes.
• 'complete' new flags:
  • "F{func}"   complete using given function
  • "F"         complete using 'completefunc'
  • "o"         complete using 'omnifunc'
• 'complete' allows limiting matches for sources using "{flag}^<limit>".
• 'completeopt' flag "nearset" sorts completion results by distance to cursor.
• 'diffopt' `inline:` configures diff highlighting for changes within a line.
• 'grepformat' is now a |global-local| option.
• 'pummaxwidth' sets maximum width for the completion popup menu.
• 'winborder' "bold" style, custom border style.
• |g:clipboard| accepts a string name to force any builtin clipboard tool.
• 'busy' sets a buffer "busy" status. Indicated in the default statusline.

PERFORMANCE

• |vim.glob.to_lpeg()| uses a new LPeg-based implementation (Peglob) that
  provides ~50% speedup for complex patterns. The implementation restores
  support for nested braces and follows LSP 3.17 specification with
  additional constraints for improved correctness and resistance to
  backtracking edge cases.

PLUGINS

• Customize :checkhealth by handling a `FileType checkhealth` event.
  |health-usage|

STARTUP

• todo

UI

• |:restart| restarts Nvim and reattaches the current UI.
• |:checkhealth| shows a summary in the header for every healthcheck.
• |ui-multigrid| provides composition information and absolute coordinates.
• `vim._extui` provides an experimental commandline and message UI intended to
  replace the message grid in the TUI.
• Error messages are more concise:
  • "Error detected while processing:" changed to "Error in:".
  • "Error executing Lua:" changed to "Lua:".
• 'busy' status is shown in default statusline with symbol ◐
