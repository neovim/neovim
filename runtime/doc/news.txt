BREAKING CHANGES                                                *news-breaking*

The following changes may require adaptations in user config or plugins.

• |vim.tbl_islist()| now checks whether a table is actually list-like (i.e.,
  has integer keys without gaps and starting from 1). For the previous
  behavior (only check for integer keys, allow gaps or not starting with 1),
  use |vim.tbl_isarray()|.

• "#" followed by a digit no longer stands for a function key at the start of
  the lhs of a mapping.

• `:behave` was removed. if you used `:behave mswin`, the following is equivalent: >vim

    set selection=exclusive
    set selectmode=mouse,key
    set mousemodel=popup
    set keymodel=startsel,stopsel

• |vim.tbl_contains()| now works for general tables and allows specifying a
  predicate function that is checked for each value. (Use |vim.list_contains()|
  for checking list-like tables (integer keys without gaps) for literal values.)

• |vim.region()| can use a string accepted by |getpos()| as position.
