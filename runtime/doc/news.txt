NEW FEATURES                                                    *news-features*

The following new features were added.

API

• |nvim_win_text_height()| can limit the lines checked when a certain
  `max_height` is reached, and returns the `end_row` and `end_vcol` for which
  `max_height` or the calculated height is reached.
• |vim.secure.read()| now returns `true` for trusted directories. Previously
  it would return `nil`, which made it impossible to tell if the directory was
  actually trusted.
• Added |vim.lsp.is_enabled()| to check if a given LSP config has been enabled
  by |vim.lsp.enable()|.
• |nvim_echo()| can set the |ui-messages| kind with which to emit the message.

BUILD

• A Zig-based build system has been added as an alternative to CMake. It is
  currently limited in functionality, and CMake remains the recommended option
  for the time being.

DEFAULTS

• 'statusline' default is exposed as a statusline expression (previously it
  was implemented as an internal C routine).
• Project-local configuration ('exrc') is also loaded from parent directories.
  Unset 'exrc' to stop further search.

DIAGNOSTICS

• |vim.diagnostic.setloclist()| and |vim.diagnostic.setqflist()| now support a
  `format` function to modify (or filter) diagnostics before being set in the
  location/quickfix list.
• |vim.diagnostic.get()| now accepts an `enabled` filter to only return
  enabled or disabled diagnostics.

EDITOR

• |:iput| works like |:put| but adjusts indent.
• |omnicompletion| in `help` buffer. |ft-help-omni|

EVENTS

• |CmdlineLeavePre| triggered before preparing to leave the command line.
• New `append` paremeter for |ui-messages| `msg_show` event.

HIGHLIGHTS

• |hl-DiffTextAdd| highlights added text within a changed line.

LSP

• |vim.lsp.ClientConfig| gained `workspace_required`.
• Support for `textDocument/documentColor`: |lsp-document_color|
  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_documentColor
• The `textDocument/diagnostic` request now includes the previous id in its
  parameters.

LUA

• Lua type annotations for `vim.uv`.
• |vim.hl.range()| now allows multiple timed highlights.
• |vim.tbl_extend()| and |vim.tbl_deep_extend()| now accept a function behavior argument.

OPTIONS

• 'autowriteall' writes all buffers upon receiving `SIGHUP`, `SIGQUIT` or `SIGTSTP`.
• 'chistory' and 'lhistory' set size of the |quickfix-stack|.
• 'completefuzzycollect' enables fuzzy collection of candidates for (some)
  |ins-completion| modes.
• 'completeopt' flag "nearset" sorts completion results by distance to cursor.
• 'diffopt' `inline:` configures diff highlighting for changes within a line.
• 'grepformat' is now a |global-local| option.
• 'pummaxwidth' sets maximum width for the completion popup menu.
• 'winborder' "bold" style.
• |g:clipboard| accepts a string name to force any builtin clipboard tool.

PERFORMANCE

• |vim.glob.to_lpeg()| uses a new LPeg-based implementation (Peglob) that
  provides ~50% speedup for complex patterns. The implementation restores
  support for nested braces and follows LSP 3.17 specification with
  additional constraints for improved correctness and resistance to
  backtracking edge cases.

PLUGINS

• Customize :checkhealth by handling a `FileType checkhealth` event.
  |health-usage|

STARTUP

• todo

TERMINAL

• |nvim_open_term()| can be called with a non-empty buffer. The buffer
  contents are piped to the PTY and displayed as terminal output.

TREESITTER

• todo

TUI

• todo

UI

• |:checkhealth| shows a summary in the header for every healthcheck.
• |ui-multigrid| provides composition information and absolute coordinates.
• `vim._extui` provides an experimental commandline and message UI intended to
  replace the message grid in the TUI.
• Error messages are more concise:
  • "Error detected while processing:" changed to "Error in:".
  • "Error executing Lua:" changed to "Lua:".

VIMSCRIPT

• |cmdcomplete_info()| gets current cmdline completion info.
