BREAKING CHANGES IN HEAD                                    *news-breaking-dev*

              ====== Remove this section before release. ======

The following changes to UNRELEASED features were made during the development
cycle (Nvim HEAD, the "master" branch).

==============================================================================
BREAKING CHANGES                                                *news-breaking*

These changes may require adaptations in your config or plugins.

API

• `vim.rpcnotify(0)` and `rpcnotify(0)` broadcast to ALL channels. Previously
  they would "multicast" only to subscribed channels (controlled by
  `nvim_subscribe()`). Plugins and clients that want "multicast" behavior must
  now maintain their own list of channels.
  • In the future, |vim.rpcnotify()| may accept a list of channels, if there
    is demand for this use-case.

DEFAULTS

• |]d-default| and |[d-default| accept a count.
• |[D-default| and |]D-default| jump to the first and last diagnostic in the
  current buffer, respectively.

DIAGNOSTICS

• |vim.diagnostic.config()| accepts a "jump" table to specify defaults for
  |vim.diagnostic.jump()|.

EDITOR

• The order in which signs are placed was changed. Higher priority signs will
  now appear left of lower priority signs.
• |hl-CurSearch| now behaves the same as Vim and no longer updates on every
  cursor movement.
• Moving in the buffer list using |:bnext| and similar commands behaves as
  documented and skips help buffers if run from a non-help buffer, otherwise
  it moves to another help buffer.

VIM SCRIPT

• |v:msgpack_types| has the type "binary" removed. |msgpackparse()| no longer
  treats BIN, STR and FIXSTR as separate types. Any of these is returned as a
  string if possible, or a |blob| if the value contained embedded NUL:s.

EVENTS

• TODO

LSP

• TODO

LUA

• API functions now consistently return an empty dictionary as
  |vim.empty_dict()|. Earlier, a |lua-special-tbl| was sometimes used.

OPTIONS

• The 'statuscolumn' `%l` item can now be used as a number column segment that
  changes according to related options. It takes care of alignment, 'number',
  'relativenumber' and 'signcolumn' set to "number". The now redundant `%r` item
  is no longer treated specially for 'statuscolumn'.

NEW FEATURES                                                    *news-features*

The following new features were added.

API

• |nvim__ns_set()| can set properties for a namespace

DEFAULTS

• Mappings:
  • |grn| in Normal mode maps to |vim.lsp.buf.rename()|
  • |grr| in Normal mode maps to |vim.lsp.buf.references()|
  • |gra| in Normal and Visual mode maps to |vim.lsp.buf.code_action()|
  • CTRL-S in Insert mode maps to |vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()|

• Snippet:
  • `<Tab>` in Insert and Select mode maps to `vim.snippet.jump({ direction = 1 })`
    when a snippet is active and jumpable forwards.
  • `<S-Tab>` in Insert and Select mode maps to `vim.snippet.jump({ direction = -1 })`
    when a snippet is active and jumpable backwards.

EDITOR

• On Windows, filename arguments on the command-line prefixed with "~\" or
  "~/" are now expanded to the user's profile directory, not a relative path
  to a literal "~" directory.
• |hl-PmenuMatch| and |hl-PmenuMatchSel| show matched text in completion popup.

EVENTS

• |CompleteDone| now sets the `reason` key in `v:event` which specifies the reason
  for completion being done.

LSP

• Completion side effects (including snippet expansion, execution of commands
  and application of additional text edits) is now built-in.
• |vim.lsp.util.locations_to_items()| sets `end_col` and `end_lnum` fields.
• |vim.lsp.buf.format()| now supports passing a list of ranges
  via the `range` parameter (this requires support for the
  `textDocument/rangesFormatting` request).

LUA

• TODO

OPTIONS

• 'completeopt' flag "fuzzy" enables |fuzzy-matching| during |ins-completion|.
• 'tabclose' controls which tab page to focus when closing a tab page.

PERFORMANCE

• TODO

PLUGINS

• EditorConfig
  • spelling_language property is now supported.

STARTUP

• TODO

TERMINAL

• The |terminal| now understands the OSC 52 escape sequence to write to the
  system clipboard (copy). Querying with OSC 52 (paste) is not supported.
• |hl-StatusLineTerm| and |hl-StatusLineTermNC| define highlights for the
  status line in |terminal| windows.
• The terminal buffer now supports reflow (wrapped lines adapt when the buffer
  is resized horizontally). Note: Lines that are not visible and kept in
  'scrollback' are not reflown.

TREESITTER

• |LanguageTree:node_for_range()| gets anonymous and named nodes for a range
• |vim.treesitter.get_node()| now takes an option `include_anonymous`, default
  false, which allows it to return anonymous nodes as well as named nodes.

CHANGED FEATURES                                                 *news-changed*

These existing features changed their behavior.

• 'scrollbind' now works properly with buffers that contain virutal lines.

  Scrollbind works by aligning to a target top line of each window in a tab
  page. Previously this was done by calculating the difference between the old
  top line and the target top line, and scrolling by that amount. Now the
  top lines are calculated using screen line numbers which take virtual lines
  into account.

REMOVED FEATURES                                                 *news-removed*
