BREAKING CHANGES IN HEAD OR EXPERIMENTAL                    *news-breaking-dev*

              ====== Remove this section before release. ======

The following changes to UNRELEASED features were made during the development
cycle (Nvim HEAD, the "master" branch).

EXPERIMENTS

• Removed `vim.loader.disable()`. Use `vim.loader.enable(false)` instead.

OPTIONS

• 'jumpoptions' flag "unload" has been renamed to "clean".
• The `msghistory` option has been removed in favor of 'messagesopt'.

==============================================================================
BREAKING CHANGES                                                *news-breaking*

These changes may require adaptations in your config or plugins.

API

• Improved API "meta" docstrings and :help documentation.
• `vim.rpcnotify(0)` and `rpcnotify(0)` broadcast to ALL channels. Previously
  they would "multicast" only to subscribed channels (controlled by
  `nvim_subscribe()`). Plugins and clients that want "multicast" behavior must
  now maintain their own list of channels.
  • In the future, |vim.rpcnotify()| may accept a list of channels, if there
    is demand for this use-case.
• "Dictionary" was renamed to "Dict" internally and in the RPC |api-metadata|.
  This is not expected to break clients because there are no known clients
  that actually use the `return_type` field or the parameter type names
  reported by |--api-info| or |nvim_get_api_info()|.
• |nvim_open_win()| supports a `mouse` field that allows configuring mouse
  interaction with the window separately from `focusable` field.
• Renamed `nvim__id_dictionary` (unsupported/experimental API) to
  `nvim__id_dict`.

BUILD

On Windows, only building with the UCRT runtime is supported.

DEFAULTS

• |]d-default| and |[d-default| accept a count.
• |[D-default| and |]D-default| jump to the first and last diagnostic in the
  current buffer, respectively.
• 'number', 'relativenumber', 'signcolumn', and 'foldcolumn' are disabled in
  |terminal| buffers. See |terminal-config| for an example of changing these defaults.
• |vim.json.encode()| no longer escapes the forward slash symbol by default

DIAGNOSTICS

• |vim.diagnostic.config()| accepts a "jump" table to specify defaults for
  |vim.diagnostic.jump()|.
• The "underline" diagnostics handler sorts diagnostics by severity when using
  the "severity_sort" option.

EDITOR

• The order in which signs are placed was changed. Higher priority signs will
  now appear left of lower priority signs.
• |hl-CurSearch| now behaves the same as Vim and no longer updates on every
  cursor movement.
• Moving in the buffer list using |:bnext| and similar commands behaves as
  documented and skips help buffers if run from a non-help buffer, otherwise
  it moves to another help buffer.
• Bells from a |terminal| buffer are now silent by default, unless 'belloff'
  option doesn't contain "term" or "all".

EVENTS

• |vim.ui_attach()| callbacks for |ui-messages| `msg_show` events are executed in
  |api-fast| context.

LSP

• Improved rendering of LSP hover docs. |K-lsp-default|
• |vim.lsp.completion.enable()| gained the `convert` callback which enables
  customizing the transformation of an LSP CompletionItem to |complete-items|.
• |vim.lsp.diagnostic.from()| can be used to convert a list of
  |vim.Diagnostic| objects into their LSP diagnostic representation.
• |vim.lsp.buf.references()|, |vim.lsp.buf.declaration()|, |vim.lsp.buf.definition()|,
  |vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()|, |vim.lsp.buf.implementation()| and
  |vim.lsp.buf.hover()| now support merging the results of multiple clients
  but no longer trigger the global handlers from `vim.lsp.handlers`
• |vim.lsp.buf.typehierarchy()| now passes the correct params for each
  client request.
• |vim.lsp.handlers.signature_help()| is no longer used.
• |vim.lsp.diagnostic.on_publish_diagnostics()| and
  |vim.lsp.diagnostic.on_diagnostic()| no longer accept a config parameter and
  can no longer be configured with |vim.lsp.with()|.
  Instead use: >lua
    vim.diagnostic.config(config, vim.lsp.diagnostic.get_namespace(client_id))
<
• |vim.lsp.util.make_position_params()|, |vim.lsp.util.make_range_params()|
  and |vim.lsp.util.make_given_range_params()| now require the `position_encoding`
  parameter.

LUA

• API functions now consistently return an empty dictionary as
  |vim.empty_dict()|. Earlier, a |lua-special-tbl| was sometimes used.
• Command-line completions for: `vim.g`, `vim.t`, `vim.w`, `vim.b`, `vim.v`,
  `vim.o`, `vim.wo`, `vim.bo`, `vim.opt`, `vim.opt_local`, `vim.opt_global`,
  and `vim.fn`.

OPTIONS

• The 'statuscolumn' `%l` item can now be used as a number column segment that
  changes according to related options. It takes care of alignment, 'number',
  'relativenumber' and 'signcolumn' set to "number". The now redundant `%r` item
  is no longer treated specially for 'statuscolumn'.
• `:set {option}<` removes the local value for all |global-local| options instead
  of just string |global-local| options.
• `:setlocal {option}<` copies the global value to the local value for number
  and boolean |global-local| options instead of removing the local value.
• Setting |hidden-options| now gives an error. In particular, setting
  'noshellslash' is now only allowed on Windows.

PLUGINS

• TODO

TREESITTER

• |Query:iter_matches()| correctly returns all matching nodes in a match
  instead of only the last node. This means that the returned table maps
  capture IDs to a list of nodes that need to be iterated over. For
  backwards compatibility, an option `all=false` (only return the last
  matching node) is provided that will be removed in a future release.
• |vim.treesitter.language.get_filetypes()| always includes the {language}
  argument in addition to explicitly registered filetypes.
• |vim.treesitter.language.get_lang()| falls back to the {filetype} argument
  if no languages are explicitly registered.
• |vim.treesitter.language.add()| returns `true` if a parser was loaded
  successfully and `nil,errmsg` otherwise instead of throwing an error.
• New |TSNode:child_with_descendant()|, which is nearly identical to
  |TSNode:child_containing_descendant()| except that it can return the
  descendant itself.

TUI

• TODO

VIMSCRIPT

• |v:msgpack_types| has the type "binary" removed. |msgpackparse()| no longer
  treats BIN, STR and FIXSTR as separate types. Any of these is returned as a
  string if possible, or a |blob| if the value contained embedded NUL:s.

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES                                                    *news-features*

The following new features were added.

API

• |vim.json.encode()| has an option to enable forward slash escaping

DEFAULTS

• Highlighting:
  • Improved styling of :checkhealth and :help buffers.

    on a URL.
  • Mouse |popup-menu| includes a "Go to definition" item when LSP is active
    in the buffer.
  • Mappings inspired by Tim Pope's vim-unimpaired:
    • |[q|, |]q|, |[Q|, |]Q|, |[CTRL-Q|, |]CTRL-Q| navigate through the |quickfix| list
    • |[l|, |]l|, |[L|, |]L|, |[CTRL-L|, |]CTRL-L| navigate through the |location-list|

    when a snippet is active and jumpable forwards.
  • `<S-Tab>` in Insert and Select mode maps to `vim.snippet.jump({ direction = -1 })`
    when a snippet is active and jumpable backwards.

EDITOR

• Improved |paste| handling for redo (dot-repeat) and macros (|recording|):
  • Redoing a large paste is significantly faster and ignores 'autoindent'.
  • Replaying a macro with |@| also replays pasted text.
• On Windows, filename arguments on the command-line prefixed with "~\" or
  "~/" are now expanded to the user's profile directory, not a relative path
  to a literal "~" directory.
• |hl-PmenuMatch| and |hl-PmenuMatchSel| show matched text in completion popup.

EVENTS

• |CompleteDone| now sets the `reason` key in `v:event` which specifies the reason
  for completion being done.
• |vim.on_key()| callbacks can consume the key by returning an empty string.

LSP

• Completion side effects (including snippet expansion, execution of commands
  and application of additional text edits) is now built-in.
• |vim.lsp.util.locations_to_items()| sets `end_col` and `end_lnum` fields.
• |vim.lsp.buf.format()| now supports passing a list of ranges
  via the `range` parameter (this requires support for the
  `textDocument/rangesFormatting` request).
• |vim.lsp.buf.code_action()| actions show client name when there are multiple
  clients.
• |vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()| can now cycle through different signatures
  using `<C-s>` and also support multiple clients.

• |vim.lsp.buf.hover()| now highlights hover ranges using the
  |hl-LspReferenceTarget| highlight group.
• Functions in |vim.lsp.Client| can now be called as methods.
• Implemented LSP folding: |vim.lsp.foldexpr()|
  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_foldingRange

LUA

• |vim.fs.rm()| can delete files and directories.
• |vim.validate()| now has a new signature which uses less tables,
  is more performant and easier to read.
• |vim.str_byteindex()| and |vim.str_utfindex()| gained overload signatures
  supporting two new parameters, `encoding` and `strict_indexing`.

OPTIONS

• 'completeopt' flag "fuzzy" enables |fuzzy-matching| during |ins-completion|.
• 'messagesopt' configures |:messages| and |hit-enter| prompt.
• 'tabclose' controls which tab page to focus when closing a tab page.

PERFORMANCE

• TODO

PLUGINS

• EditorConfig
  • spelling_language property is now supported.

STARTUP

• Nvim will fail if the |--listen| or |$NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS| address is
  invalid, instead of silently skipping an invalid address.

TERMINAL

• The |terminal| now understands the OSC 52 escape sequence to write to the
  system clipboard (copy). Querying with OSC 52 (paste) is not supported.
• |hl-StatusLineTerm| and |hl-StatusLineTermNC| define highlights for the
  status line in |terminal| windows.
• The terminal buffer now supports reflow (wrapped lines adapt when the buffer
  is resized horizontally). Note: Lines that are not visible and kept in
  'scrollback' are not reflown.
• The |terminal| now supports OSC 8 escape sequences and will display
  hyperlinks in supporting host terminals.

TREESITTER

• |LanguageTree:node_for_range()| gets anonymous and named nodes for a range
• |vim.treesitter.get_node()| now takes an option `include_anonymous`, default
  false, which allows it to return anonymous nodes as well as named nodes.
• |treesitter-directive-trim!| can trim all whitespace (not just empty lines)
  from both sides of a node.

TUI

• The builtin UI declares info |nvim_set_client_info()| on its channel. See
  |startup-tui|. To see the current UI info, try this: >
    :lua =vim.api.nvim_get_chan_info(vim.api.nvim_list_uis()[1].chan)
• |log| messages written by the builtin UI client (TUI, |--remote-ui|) are
  now prefixed with "ui" instead of "?".
• The TUI will re-query the terminal's background color when a theme update
  notification is received and Nvim will update 'background' accordingly.

UI

• |vim.ui.open()| (by default bound to |gx|) accepts an `opt.cmd` parameter
  which controls the tool used to open the given path or URL. If you want to
  globally set this, you can override vim.ui.open using the same approach
  described at |vim.paste()|.
- `vim.ui.open()` now supports
  [lemonade](https://github.com/lemonade-command/lemonade) as an option for
  opening urls/files. This is handy if you are in an ssh connection and use
  `lemonade`.
• The |ins-completion-menu| now supports cascading highlight styles.
  |hl-PmenuSel| and |hl-PmenuMatch| both inherit from |hl-Pmenu|, and
  |hl-PmenuMatchSel| inherits highlights from both |hl-PmenuSel| and
  |hl-PmenuMatch|.
• |vim.diagnostic.setqflist()| updates existing diagnostics quickfix list if one
  exists.

• |ui-messages| content chunks now also contain the highlight group ID.

==============================================================================
CHANGED FEATURES                                                 *news-changed*

These existing features changed their behavior.

• 'scrollbind' now works properly with buffers that contain virtual lines.

  Scrollbind works by aligning to a target top line of each window in a tab
  page. Previously this was done by calculating the difference between the old
  top line and the target top line, and scrolling by that amount. Now the
  top lines are calculated using screen line numbers which take virtual lines
  into account.

• The implementation of grapheme clusters (or combining chars |mbyte-combining|)
  was upgraded to closely follow extended grapheme clusters as defined by UAX#29
  in the unicode standard. Noteworthily, this enables proper display of many
  more emoji characters than before, including those encoded with multiple
  emoji codepoints combined with ZWJ (zero width joiner) codepoints.

• Text in the 'statusline', 'tabline', and 'winbar' now inherits highlights
  from the respective |hl-StatusLine|, |hl-TabLine|, and |hl-WinBar| highlight
  groups.

• |vim.on_key()| callbacks won't be invoked recursively when a callback itself
  consumes input.

• "q" in man pages now uses |CTRL-W_q| instead of |CTRL-W_c| to close the
  current window, and it no longer throws |E444| when there is only one window
  on the screen. Global variable `vim.g.pager` is removed.

• Default 'titlestring' is now implemented with 'statusline' "%" format items.
  This means the default, empty value is essentially an alias to:
  `%t%(\ %M%)%(\ \(%{expand(\"%:~:h\")}\)%)%a\ -\ Nvim`. This is only an
  implementation simplification, not a behavior change.
