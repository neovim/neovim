NEW FEATURES                                                    *news-features*

The following new APIs or features were added.

• |nvim_open_win()| now accepts a relative `mouse` option to open a floating win
  relative to the mouse. Note that the mouse doesn't update frequently without
  setting `vim.o.mousemoveevent = true`

• EditorConfig support is now builtin. This is enabled by default and happens
  automatically. To disable it, users should add >lua

    vim.g.editorconfig = false
<
  (or the Vimscript equivalent) to their |config| file.

• Run Lua scripts from your shell using |-l|. >
      nvim -l foo.lua --arg1 --arg2
<  Also works with stdin: >
      echo "print(42)" | nvim -l -

• Added a |vim.lsp.codelens.clear()| function to clear codelenses.

• |vim.inspect_pos()|, |vim.show_pos()| and |:Inspect| allow a user to get or show items
  at a given buffer position. Currently this includes treesitter captures,
  semantic tokens, syntax groups and extmarks.

• Added support for semantic token highlighting to the LSP client. This
  functionality is enabled by default when a client that supports this feature
  is attached to a buffer. Opt-out can be performed by deleting the
  `semanticTokensProvider` from the LSP client's {server_capabilities} in the
  `LspAttach` callback.

  See |lsp-semantic_tokens| for more information.

• |vim.treesitter.show_tree()| opens a split window showing a text
  representation of the nodes in a language tree for the current buffer.

• Added support for the `willSave` and `willSaveWaitUntil` capabilities to the
  LSP client. `willSaveWaitUntil` allows a server to modify a document before it
  gets saved. Example use-cases by language servers include removing unused
  imports, or formatting the file.

• Treesitter syntax highlighting for `help` files now supports highlighted
  code examples. To enable, create a `.config/nvim/ftplugin/help.lua` with
  the contents >lua
    vim.treesitter.start()
<
  Note: Highlighted code examples are only available in the Nvim manual, not
  in help files taken from Vim. The treesitter `help` parser is also work in
  progress and not guaranteed to correctly highlight every help file in the
  wild.

• |vim.secure.trust()|, |:trust| allows the user to manage files in trust
  database.

• |vim.diagnostic.open_float()| (and therefore |vim.diagnostic.config()|) now
  accepts a `suffix` option which, by default, renders LSP error codes.
  Similarly, the `virtual_text` configuration in |vim.diagnostic.config()| now
  has a `suffix` option which does nothing by default.

• |vim.fs.dir()| now has a `opts` argument with a depth field to allow
  recursively searching a directory tree.

• |vim.secure.read()| reads a file and prompts the user if it should be
  trusted and, if so, returns the file's contents.

• When using Nvim inside tmux 3.2 or later, the default clipboard provider
  will now copy to the system clipboard. |provider-clipboard|

• |'showcmdloc'| option to display the 'showcmd' information in the
  status line or tab line. A new %S statusline item is available to place
  the 'showcmd' text in a custom 'statusline'. Useful for when |'cmdheight'|
  is set to 0.

• |'splitkeep'| option to control the scroll behavior of horizontal splits.

• |'statuscolumn'| option to customize the area to the side of a window,
  normally containing the fold, sign and number columns. This new option follows
  the 'statusline' syntax and can be used to transform the line numbers, create
  mouse click callbacks for |signs|, introduce a custom margin or separator etc.

• |nvim_select_popupmenu_item()| now supports |cmdline-completion| popup menu.

• |'diffopt'| now includes a `linematch` option to enable a second-stage diff
  on individual hunks to provide much more accurate diffs. This option is also
  available to |vim.diff()|

  See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/14537.

• |vim.diagnostic.is_disabled()| checks if diagnostics are disabled in a given
  buffer or namespace.

• |--remote-ui| option was added to connect to a remote instance and display
  in it in a |TUI| in the local terminal. This can be used run a headless nvim
  instance in the background and display its UI on demand, which previously
  only was possible using an external UI implementation.

• Several improvements were made to make the code generation scripts more
  deterministic, and a `LUA_GEN_PRG` build parameter has been introduced to
  allow for a workaround for some remaining reproducibility problems.

• |:highlight| now supports an additional attribute "altfont".

• Treesitter captures can now be transformed by directives. This will allow
  more complicated dynamic language injections.

• |vim.treesitter.query.get_node_text()| now accepts a `metadata` option for
  writing custom directives using |vim.treesitter.query.add_directive()|.

CHANGED FEATURES                                                 *news-changes*

The following changes to existing APIs or features add new behavior.

• 'exrc' now supports `.nvim.lua` file.
• 'exrc' is no longer marked deprecated.

• The |TUI| is changed to run in a separate process (previously, a separate
  thread was used). This is not supposed to be a visible change to the user,
  but might be the cause of subtle changes of behavior and bugs.

  Previously, the TUI could be disabled as a build time feature (+tui/-tui),
  resulting in a nvim binary which only could be run headless or embedded
  in an external process. As of this version, TUI is always available.

• API calls now show more information about where an exception happened.

==============================================================================
REMOVED FEATURES                                                 *news-removed*

The following deprecated functions or APIs were removed.

• It is no longer possible to scroll the whole screen when showing messages
  longer than 'cmdheight'. |msgsep| is now always enabled even if 'display'
  doesn't contain the "msgsep" flag.

• `filetype.vim` is removed in favor of |lua-filetype|
  (Note that filetype logic and tests still align with Vim, so additions or
  changes need to be contributed there first.)
  See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/20674.

==============================================================================
DEPRECATIONS                                                *news-deprecations*

The following functions are now deprecated and will be removed in the next
release.
