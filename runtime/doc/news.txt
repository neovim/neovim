BREAKING CHANGES                                                *news-breaking*

The following changes may require adaptations in user config or plugins.

• In some cases, the cursor in the Nvim |TUI| used to blink even without
  configuring 'guicursor' as mentioned in |cursor-blinking|. This was a bug
  that has now been fixed. If your cursor has stopped blinking, add the
  following (or similar, adapted to user preference) to your |config| file: >vim

    set guicursor+=n-v-c:blinkon500-blinkoff500
<
• |vim.tbl_islist()| now checks whether a table is actually list-like (i.e.,
  has integer keys without gaps and starting from 1). For the previous
  behavior (only check for integer keys, allow gaps or not starting with 1),
  use |vim.tbl_isarray()|.

• "#" followed by a digit no longer stands for a function key at the start of
  the lhs of a mapping.

• `:behave` was removed.
  - If you used `:behave xterm`, the following is equivalent: >vim

    set mousemodel=extend
<
  - If you used `:behave mswin`, the following is equivalent: >vim

    set selection=exclusive
    set selectmode=mouse,key
    set mousemodel=popup
    set keymodel=startsel,stopsel
<
• When switching windows, |CursorMoved| autocommands trigger when Nvim is back
  in the main loop rather than immediately. This is more compatible with Vim.

• |-l| ensures output ends with a newline if the script prints messages and
  doesn't cause Nvim to exit.

• |LspRequest| and LspProgressUpdate (renamed to |LspProgress|) autocmds were
  promoted from a |User| autocmd to first class citizen.

• Renamed `vim.treesitter.playground` to `vim.treesitter.dev`.

• Removed functions from the |vim.json| module:
  • Unnecessary, undocumented functions which caused global side-effects.
  • `vim.json.null` is redundant with `vim.NIL`.
  • `vim.json.array_mt` (and related) is redundant with `vim.empty_dict()`.

• Removed some Vim 5.0<= option compatibilities:
  • |'backspace'| no longer supports number values. Instead:
    • for `backspace=0` set `backspace=` (empty)
    • for `backspace=1` set `backspace=indent,eol`
    • for `backspace=2` set `backspace=indent,eol,start` (default behavior in Nvim)
    • for `backspace=3` set `backspace=indent,eol,nostop`
  • |'backupdir'| and |'directory'| will no longer remove a `>` at the start
    of the option.

• |LanguageTree:parse()| will no longer parse injections by default and
  now requires an explicit range argument to be passed. If injections are
  required, provide an explicit range via `parser:parse({ start_row, end_row })`.

• |vim.lsp.util.parse_snippet()| will now strictly follow the snippet grammar
  defined by LSP, and hence previously parsed snippets might now be considered
  invalid input.

• |OptionSet| autocommand args |v:option_new|, |v:option_old|,
  |v:option_oldlocal|, |v:option_oldglobal| now have the type of the option
  instead of always being strings. |v:option_old| is now the old global value
  for all global-local options, instead of just string global-local options.

• Local value for a global-local number/boolean option is now unset when
  the option is set (e.g. using |:set| or |nvim_set_option_value()|) without a
  scope, which means they now behave the same way as string options.

• Signs placed through the legacy |sign-commands| are now stored and displayed
  as |extmarks| internally. Along with the following changes:
  • A sign placed twice in the same group with the same identifier will be moved.
  • Legacy signs are always deleted along with the line it is placed on.
  • Legacy and extmark signs will show up in both |:sign-place-list| and |nvim_buf_get_extmarks()|.
  • Legacy and extmark signs are displayed and listed with the same priority:
      line number -> priority -> sign id -> recently placed

• Default color scheme has been updated to be "Nvim branded" and accessible.
  Use `:colorscheme vim` to revert to the old legacy color scheme.

  Here is a list of Nvim specific highlight groups which are now defined in
  a meaningfully different way and might need an update:
  • |hl-FloatBorder| is linked to |hl-NormalFloat| instead of |hl-WinSeparator|.
  • |hl-NormalFloat| is not linked to |hl-Pmenu|.
  • |hl-WinBar| has different background.
  • |hl-WinBarNC| is similar to |hl-WinBar| but not bold.
  • |hl-WinSeparator| is linked to |hl-Normal| instead of |hl-VertSplit|.

  This also might result into some color schemes looking differently due to
  them relying on implicit assumptions about how highlight groups are defined
  by default. To account for this, define all attributes of highlight groups
  explicitly. Alternatively, use `:colorscheme vim` or `:source
  $VIMRUNTIME/colors/vim.lua` to restore previous definitions.

• 'termguicolors' is enabled by default when Nvim is able to determine that
  the host terminal emulator supports 24-bit color.

• Treesitter highlight groups have been renamed to be more in line with
  upstream tree-sitter and Helix to make it easier to share queries. The full
  list is documented in |treesitter-highlight-groups|.

• |vim.lsp.codelens.refresh()| now takes an `opts` argument. With this change,
  the default behavior of just refreshing the current buffer has been replaced by
  refreshing all buffers.

• |shm-q| now fully hides macro recording message instead of only shortening it.

• Returning any truthy value from a callback passed to |nvim_create_autocmd()|
  (rather than just `true`) will delete the autocommand.

• |vim.lsp.util.extract_completion_items()| will no longer return reliable
  results, since it does not apply `itemDefaults` when its input is a
  `CompletionList`.
  Moreover, since support for LSP `completionList.itemDefaults` was added,
  some third party plugins might be negatively impacted in case the language
  servers support the feature but the plugin does not.
  If necessary, the respective capability can be
  removed when calling |vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()|.

• |:TOhtml| has been rewritten in Lua to support Neovim-specific decorations,
  and many options have been removed.

==============================================================================
BREAKING CHANGES IN HEAD                                    *news-breaking-dev*

The following breaking changes were made during the development cycle to
unreleased features on Nvim HEAD.

• Removed `vim.treesitter.foldtext` as transparent foldtext is now supported
  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/20750

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES                                                    *news-features*

The following new APIs and features were added.

• Performance:
  • 'diffopt' "linematch" scoring algorithm now favours larger and less groups
    https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/23611
  • Treesitter highlighting now parses injections incrementally during
    screen redraws only for the line range being rendered. This significantly
    improves performance in large files with many injections.
  • 'breakindent' performance is significantly improved for wrapped lines.
  • Cursor movement, insertion with [count] and |screenpos()| are now faster.

• |vim.iter()| provides a generic iterator interface for tables and Lua
  iterators |for-in|.

• |vim.ringbuf()| creates ring buffers.

• |vim.keycode()| translates keycodes in a string.

• |'smoothscroll'| option to scroll by screen line rather than by text line
  when |'wrap'| is set.

• |nvim_buf_set_extmark()| supports inline virtual text.

• 'foldtext' now supports virtual text format. |fold-foldtext|

• |'foldtext'| can be set to an empty string to disable and render the line:
  as normal with regular highlighting and no line wrapping.

• The terminal buffer now supports reflow (wrapped lines adapt when the buffer
  is resized horizontally). Note: Lines that are not visible and kept in
  |'scrollback'| are not reflown.

• |vim.system()| for running system commands.

• |vim.lpeg| and |vim.re| expose the bundled Lpeg expression grammar parser
  and its regex interface.

• |nvim_win_text_height()| computes the number of screen lines occupied
  by a range of text in a given window.

• Mapping APIs now support abbreviations when mode short-name has suffix "a".

• Better cmdline completion for string option value. |complete-set-option|

• Builtin TUI can now recognize "super" (|<D-|) and "meta" (|<T-|) modifiers in a
  terminal emulator that supports |tui-csiu|.

• Editor
  • By default, the swapfile "ATTENTION" |E325| dialog is skipped if the
    swapfile is owned by a running Nvim process, instead of prompting. If you
    always want the swapfile dialog, delete the default SwapExists handler:
    `autocmd! nvim_swapfile`. |default-autocmds|

• LSP
  • LSP method names are available in |vim.lsp.protocol.Methods|.
  • Implemented LSP inlay hints: |lsp-inlay_hint|
    https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_inlayHint
  • Implemented pull diagnostic textDocument/diagnostic: |vim.lsp.diagnostic.on_diagnostic()|
    https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_diagnostic
  • |vim.lsp.status()| consumes the last progress messages as a string.
  • LSP client now always saves and restores named buffer marks when applying
    text edits.
  • LSP client now supports the `positionEncoding` server capability. If a server
    responds with the `positionEncoding` capability in its initialization
    response, Nvim automatically sets the client's `offset_encoding` field.
  • Dynamic registration of LSP capabilities. An implication of this change is
    that checking a client's `server_capabilities` is no longer a sufficient
    indicator to see if a server supports a feature. Instead use
    `client.supports_method(<method>)`. It considers both the dynamic
    capabilities and static `server_capabilities`.
  • `anchor_bias` option to |lsp-handlers| aids in positioning of floating
    windows.
  • |vim.lsp.util.locations_to_items()| sets the `user_data` of each item to
    the original LSP `Location` or `LocationLink`.
  • Added support for connecting to servers using named pipes (Windows) or
    unix domain sockets (Unix) via |vim.lsp.rpc.domain_socket_connect()|.
  • Added support for `completionList.itemDefaults`, reducing overhead when
    computing completion items where properties often share the same value
    (e.g. `commitCharacters`). Note that this might affect plugins and
    language servers that don't support the feature, and in such cases the
    respective capability can be unset.

• Treesitter
  • Bundled parsers and queries (highlight, folds) for Markdown, Python, and
    Bash.
  • |vim.treesitter.query.omnifunc()| for treesitter query files (set by
    default).
  • |Query:iter_matches()| now has the ability to set the maximum start depth
    for matches.
  • `@injection.language` now has smarter resolution and will fall back to
    language aliases (e.g., filetype or custom shorthands) registered via
    |vim.treesitter.language.register()| and/or attempt lower case variants of
    the text.
  • The `#set!` directive now supports `injection.self` and `injection.parent`
    for injecting either the current node's language or the parent
    |LanguageTree|'s language, respectively.
  • |vim.treesitter.query.edit()| allows live editing of treesitter
    queries.
  • Improved error messages for query parsing.
  • |:InspectTree| shows node ranges in 0-based indexing instead of 1-based
    indexing.
  • |:InspectTree| shows root nodes
  • |:InspectTree| now supports |folding|

• |vim.ui.open()| opens URIs using the system default handler (macOS `open`,
  Windows `explorer`, Linux `xdg-open`, etc.)

• |vim.wo| can now be double indexed for |:setlocal| behaviour. Currently only
  `0` for the buffer index is currently supported.

• Lua type annotations for:
  • `vim.*`
  • `vim.fn.*`
  • `vim.api.*`
  • `vim.v.*`

• Improved messages for type errors in `vim.api.*` calls (including `opts` params)

• Functions that take a severity as an optional parameter (e.g.
  |vim.diagnostic.get()|) now also accept a list of severities |vim.diagnostic.severity|

• New RPC client type `msgpack-rpc` is added for |nvim_set_client_info()| to
  support fully MessagePack-RPC compliant clients.

• Floating windows can now show footer with new `footer` and `footer_pos`
  config fields. Uses |hl-FloatFooter| by default.

• Floating windows can now be hidden by setting `hide` in |nvim_open_win()| or
  |nvim_win_set_config()|.

• |:terminal| command now accepts some |:command-modifiers| (specifically
  |:horizontal| and those that affect splitting a window).

• |$NVIM_APPNAME| can be set to a relative path instead of only a name.

• |:fclose| command.

• |vim.snippet| handles expansion of snippets in LSP format.

• 'complete' option supports "f" flag for completing buffer names.

• |vim.base64.encode()| and |vim.base64.decode()| encode and decode strings
  using Base64 encoding.

• The |TermResponse| autocommand event can be used with |v:termresponse| to
  read escape sequence responses from the terminal.

• A clipboard provider which uses OSC 52 to copy the selection to the system
  clipboard is now bundled by default and will be automatically enabled under
  certain conditions. |clipboard-osc52|

• 'termsync' option asks the terminal emulator to buffer screen updates until
  the redraw cycle is complete. Requires support from the terminal.

• |vim.text.hexencode()| and |vim.text.hexdecode()| convert strings to and
  from byte representations.

• 'completeopt' option supports "popup" flag to show extra information in a
  floating window.

• |nvim_input_mouse()| supports mouse buttons "x1" and "x2".

• |v_Q-default| and |v_@-default| repeat a register for each line of a visual
  selection.

• |vim.diagnostic.count()| returns the number of diagnostics for a given
  buffer and/or namespace, by severity. This is a faster alternative to
  |vim.diagnostic.get()| when only the number of diagnostics is needed, but
  not the diagnostics themselves.

• |vim.deepcopy()| has a `noref` argument to avoid hashing table values.

• Terminal buffers emit a |TermRequest| autocommand event when the child
  process emits an OSC or DCS control sequence.

• Terminal buffers respond to OSC background and foreground requests. |default-autocmds|

• |vim.version.le()| and |vim.version.ge()| are added to |vim.version|.

• |extmarks| can be associated with a URL and URLs are included as a new
  highlight attribute. The TUI will display URLs using the OSC 8 control
  sequence, enabling clickable text in supporting terminals.

• Added |nvim_tabpage_set_win()| to set the current window of a tabpage.

• Clicking on a tabpage in the tabline with the middle mouse button closes it.

• |namespace| can now have window scopes. |nvim_win_add_ns()|

• |extmarks| option `scoped`: only show the extmarks in its namespace's scope.

==============================================================================
CHANGED FEATURES                                                 *news-changed*

The following changes to existing APIs or features add new behavior.

• |vim.tbl_contains()| now works for general tables and allows specifying a
  predicate function that is checked for each value. (Use |vim.list_contains()|
  for checking list-like tables (integer keys without gaps) for literal values.)

• |vim.region()| can use a string accepted by |getpos()| as position.

• |vim.diagnostic.config()| now accepts a function for the virtual_text.prefix
  option, which allows for rendering e.g., diagnostic severities differently.

• Defaults:
  • On Windows 'isfname' does not include ":". Drive letters are handled
    correctly without it. (Use |gF| for filepaths suffixed with ":line:col").
  • 'comments' includes "fb:•".
  • 'shortmess' includes the "C" flag.
  • Automatic linting of treesitter query files (see |ft-query-plugin|).
    Can be disabled via: >lua
      vim.g.query_lint_on = {}
<
  • Enabled treesitter highlighting for treesitter query files.
  • Enabled treesitter highlighting for help files.
  • Enabled treesitter highlighting for Lua files.

• The `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` LSP client capability is now enabled
  by default.
  • On Mac or Windows, `libuv.fs_watch` is used as the backend.
  • On Linux, `fswatch` (recommended) is used as the backend if available,
    otherwise `libuv.fs_event` is used on each subdirectory.

• |LspRequest| autocmd callbacks now contain additional information about the LSP
  request status update that occurred.

• |:source| without arguments treats a buffer with its 'filetype' set to "lua"
  as Lua code regardless of its extension.

• |:lua| with a |[range]| executes that range in the current buffer as Lua code
  regardless of its extension.

• |:checkhealth| buffer now implements |folding|. The initial folding status is
  defined by the 'foldenable' option.

• |:Man| now respects 'wrapmargin'

• |gx| now uses |vim.ui.open()| and not netrw. To customize, you can redefine
  `vim.ui.open` or remap `gx`. To continue using netrw (deprecated): >vim

  :call netrw#BrowseX(expand(exists("g:netrw_gx")? g:netrw_gx : '<cfile>'), netrw#CheckIfRemote())<CR>

• |vim.lsp.start()| now maps |K| to use |vim.lsp.buf.hover()| if the server
  supports it, unless |'keywordprg'| was customized before calling
  |vim.lsp.start()|.

• Terminal buffers started with no arguments (and use 'shell') close
  automatically if the job exited without error, eliminating the (often
  unwanted) "[Process exited 0]" message.

• |vim.diagnostic.config()| now accepts virtual text relevant options to
  |nvim_buf_set_extmark()| (e.g. "virt_text_pos" and "hl_mode") in its
  "virtual_text" table, which gives users more control over how diagnostic
  virtual text is displayed.

• Extmarks now fully support multi-line ranges, and a single extmark can be
  used to highlight a range of arbitrary length. The |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|
  API function already allowed you to define such ranges, but highlight regions
  were not rendered consistently for a range that covers more than one line break.
  This has now been fixed. Signs defined as part of a multi-line extmark also
  apply to every line in the range, not just the first.
  In addition, |nvim_buf_get_extmarks()| has gained an "overlap" option to
  return such ranges even if they started before the specified position.

• The following flags were added to |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|:
  - "undo_restore": opt-out extmarks of precise undo tracking.
  - "invalidate": automatically hide or delete extmarks.
  - "virt_text_repeat_linebreak": repeat virtual text on wrapped lines.

• LSP hover and signature help now use Treesitter for highlighting of Markdown
  content.
  Note that syntax highlighting of code examples requires a matching parser
  and may be affected by custom queries.

• Support for rendering multibyte characters using composing characters has been
  enhanced. The maximum limit have been increased from 1+6 codepoints to
  31 bytes, which is guaranteed to fit all chars from before but often more.

  NOTE: the regexp engine still has a hard-coded limit of considering
  6 composing chars only.

• |vim.wait()| is no longer allowed to be called in |api-fast|.

• Vimscript function |exists()| supports checking |v:lua| functions.

• Added "force_crlf" option field in |nvim_open_term()|.

• Attempting to set an invalid keycode option (e.g. `set t_foo=123`) no longer
  gives an error.

• Passing 0 to |nvim_get_chan_info()| gets info about the current channel.

• |:checkhealth| buffer can now be opened in a split window using modifiers like
  |:vertical|, |:horizontal| and |:botright|.

• |nvim_open_win()| and |nvim_win_set_config()| now support opening normal (split)
  windows, and moving floating windows into split windows.

• 'errorfile' (|-q|) accepts `-` as an alias for stdin.

• |--startuptime| reports the startup times for both processes (TUI + server) as separate sections.

• |nvim_buf_call()| and |nvim_win_call()| now preserves any return value (NB: not multiple return values)

• Treesitter
  • |Query:iter_matches()|, |vim.treesitter.query.add_predicate()|, and
    |vim.treesitter.query.add_directive()| accept a new `all` option which
    ensures that all matching nodes are returned as a table. The default option
    `all=false` returns only a single node, breaking captures with quantifiers
    like `(comment)+ @comment; it is only provided for backward compatibility
    and will be removed after Nvim 0.10.
  • |vim.treesitter.query.add_predicate()| and
    |vim.treesitter.query.add_directive()| now accept an options table rather
    than a boolean "force" argument. To force a predicate or directive to
    override an existing predicate or directive, use `{ force = true }`.

==============================================================================
REMOVED FEATURES                                                 *news-removed*

The following deprecated functions or APIs were removed.

• Vimball support
  - :Vimuntar command

• Support for legacy treesitter injection queries

• 'shortmess' flags:
  - |shm-f|. Always uses "(3 of 5)", never "(file 3 of 5)"
  - |shm-i|. Always use "[noeol]".
  - |shm-x|. Always use "[dos]", "[unix]" and "[mac]"
  - |shm-n|. Always use "[New]".

==============================================================================

The following functions are now deprecated and will be removed in a future
release.

• Configuring |diagnostic-signs| using |:sign-define| or |sign_define()|. Use
  the "signs" key of |vim.diagnostic.config()| instead.

• Checkhealth functions:
  - |health#report_error|, |vim.health.report_error()|	Use |vim.health.error()| instead.
  - |health#report_info|, |vim.health.report_info()|	Use |vim.health.info()| instead.

  - |vim.lsp.for_each_buffer_client()|		Use |vim.lsp.get_clients()| instead.
  - |vim.lsp.util.trim_empty_lines()|		Use |vim.split()| with `trimempty` instead.
  - |vim.lsp.util.try_trim_markdown_code_blocks()|
  - |vim.lsp.util.set_lines()|
  - |vim.lsp.util.extract_completion_items()|
  - |vim.lsp.util.parse_snippet()|
  - |vim.lsp.util.text_document_completion_list_to_complete_items()|
