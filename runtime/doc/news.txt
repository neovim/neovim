NEW FEATURES                                                    *news-features*

The following new APIs or features were added.

• Added support for semantic token highlighting to the LSP client. This
  functionality is enabled by default when a client that supports this feature
  is attached to a buffer. Opt-out can be performed by deleting the
  `semanticTokensProvider` from the LSP client's {server_capabilities} in the
  `LspAttach` callback.

  See |lsp-semantic_tokens| for more information.

• |vim.treesitter.show_tree()| opens a split window showing a text
  representation of the nodes in a language tree for the current buffer.

• Added support for the `willSave` and `willSaveWaitUntil` capabilities to the
  LSP client. `willSaveWaitUntil` allows a server to modify a document before it
  gets saved. Example use-cases by language servers include removing unused
  imports, or formatting the file.

• Treesitter syntax highlighting for `help` files now supports highlighted
  code examples. To enable, create a `.config/nvim/ftplugin/help.lua` with
  the contents >lua
    vim.treesitter.start()
<
  Note: Highlighted code examples are only available in the Nvim manual, not
  in help files taken from Vim. The treesitter `help` parser is also work in
  progress and not guaranteed to correctly highlight every help file in the
  wild.

• |vim.secure.trust()|, |:trust| allows the user to manage files in trust
  database.

• |vim.diagnostic.open_float()| (and therefore |vim.diagnostic.config()|) now
  accepts a `suffix` option which, by default, renders LSP error codes.
  Similarly, the `virtual_text` configuration in |vim.diagnostic.config()| now
  has a `suffix` option which does nothing by default.

• |vim.secure.read()| reads a file and prompts the user if it should be
  trusted and, if so, returns the file's contents.

• When using Nvim inside tmux 3.2 or later, the default clipboard provider
  will now copy to the system clipboard. |provider-clipboard|

• 'splitkeep' option to control the scroll behavior of horizontal splits.

• |nvim_select_popupmenu_item()| now supports |cmdline-completion| popup menu.

• |'diffopt'| now includes a `linematch` option to enable a second-stage diff
  on individual hunks to provide much more accurate diffs. This option is also
  available to |vim.diff()|

  See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/14537.

• `filetype.vim` is removed in favor of |lua-filetype|

  changes need to be contributed there first.)
