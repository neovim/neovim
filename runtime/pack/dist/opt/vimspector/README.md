# Features and Usage

The plugin is a capable Vim graphical debugger for multiple languages.
It's mostly tested for c++ and python, but in theory supports any 
language that Visual Studio Code supports (but see caveats).

The [Vimspector website][website] has an overview of the UI, along with basic
instructions for configuration and setup.

## Supported debugging features

- breakpoints (function, line and exception breakpoints)
- step in/out/over/up, stop, restart
- launch and attach
- remote launch, remote attach
- locals and globals display
- watch expressions
- call stack and navigation
- variable value display hover
- interactive debug console
- launch debugee within Vim's embedded terminal
- logging/stdout display

## Supported languages:

The following languages are used frequently by the author and are known to work
with little effort, and are supported as first-class languages.

- C, C++, etc. (languages supported by gdb or lldb)
- Python 2 and Python 3
- TCL
- Bash scripts

## Languages known to work

The following languages are used frequently by the author, but require some sort
of hackery that makes it challenging to support generally. These languages are
on a best-efforts basis:

- Java (see caveats)
- C# (c-sharp) using dotnet core
- Go (requires separate installation of [Delve][])
- Node.js (requires node <12 for installation)
- Anything running in chrome (i.e. javascript).

## Languages known not to work

- C# (c-sharp) using mono debug adapter (vimspector unable to set breakpoints)

## Other languages

Vimspector should work for any debug adapter that works in Visual Studio Code,
but there are certain limitations (see FAQ). If you're trying to get vimspector
to work with a language that's not "supported", head over to Gitter and contact
the author. It should be possible to get it going.

# Installation

There are 2 installation methods:

* Using a release tarball, or
* Manually

Release tarballs come with debug adapters for the default languages
pre-packaged. To use a release tarball:

1. Check the dependencies
2. Untar the release tarball for your OS into `$HOME/.vim/pack`:

```
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.vim/pack
$ curl -L <url> | tar -C $HOME/.vim/pack zxvf - 
```

3. Configure your project's debug profiles (create `.vimspector.json`)

Alternatively, you can clone the repo and select which gadgets are installed:

1. Check the dependencies
1. Install the plugin as a Vim package. See `:help packages`.
2. Install some 'gadgets' (debug adapters)
3. Configure your project's debug profiles (create `.vimspector.json`)

## Dependencies

Vimspector requires:

* Vim version 8.1 with at least patch 1264, or Neovim 0.4.3
* One of the following operating systems:
  * Linux
  * macOS Mojave or pater

Why such a new vim ? Well 2 reasons:

1. Because vimspector uses a lot of new Vim features 
2. Because there are Vim bugs that vimspector triggers that will frustrate you
   if you hit them.

Why no Windows support? Because it's effort and it's not a priority for the
author. PRs are welcome.

Which Linux versions? I only test on Ubuntu 18.04 and later and RHEL 7.

### Neovim differences

neovim doesn't implement some features Vimspector relies on (WinBar and prompt
buffers), so you have to use `:Vimspector*` commands (see [Usage][#usage]).

## Language dependencies

The debug adapters themselves have certain runtime dependencies:

| Language         | Status       | Switch                       | Adapter           | Dependencies           |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| C, C++, etc.     | Supported    | `--all` or ` --enable-c`     | vscode-cpptools   | mono-core              |
| Python           | Supported    | `--all` or `--enable-python` | vscode-python     | Python 2.7 or Python 3 |
| TCL              | Experimental | `--all` or `--enable-tcl`    | tclpro            | TCL 8.5                |
| Bourne Shell     | Experimental | `--all` or `--enable-bash`   | vscode-bash-debug | Bash v??               |
| C# (dotnet core) | Experimental | `--force-enable-csharp`      | netcoredbg        | DotNet core            |
| C# (mono)        | Experimental | `--force-enable-csharp`      | vscode-mono-debug | Mono                   |
| Go               | Experimental | `--enable-go`                | vscode-go         | Go, [Delve][]          |
| Node.js          | Experimental | `--force-enable-node`        | vscode-node-debug2 | 6 < Node < 12, Npm    |
| Javascript       | Experimental | `--force-enable-chrome`      | debugger-for-chrome | Chrome |

For other languages, you'll need some other way to install the gadget.

## Clone the plugin

There are many Vim plugin managers, and I'm not going to state a particular
preference, so if you choose to use one, you're on your own with installation
issues.

Install vimspector as a Vim package, either by cloning this repository into your
package path, like this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector ~/.vim/pack/vimspector/opt/vimspector
```

2. Configure vimspector in your `.vimrc`:

```viml
let g:vimspector_enable_mappings = 'HUMAN'
```

3. Load vimspector at runtime. This can also be added to your `.vimrc` after
   configuring vimspector:

```
packadd! vimspector
```

See support/doc/example_vimrc.vim.

Also, if you want to try out vimspector without changing your vim config, run:

```
vim -Nu /path/to/vimspector/tests/vimrc --cmd "let g:vimspector_enable_mappings='HUMAN'"
```

## Install some gadgets

There are a couple of ways of doing this, but ***using `install_gadget.py` is
highly recommended*** where that's an option.

For supported languages, `install_gadget.py` will:

* Download the relevant debug adapter at a version that's been tested from the
  internet, either as a 'vsix' (Visusal Studio plugin), or clone from GitHub. If
  you're in a corporate environment and this is a problem, you may need to
  install the gadgets manually.
* Perform any necessary post-installation actions, such as:
  * Building any binary components
  * Ensuring scripts are executable, because the VSIX pacakges are usually
    broken in this regard.
  * Set up the `gadgetDir` symlinks for the platform.

To install the tested debug adapter for a language, run:

```
./install_gadget.py --enable-<language>
```

Or to install all supported gagtets:

```
./install_gadget.py --all
```

To install everything other than TCL (because TCL is sadly not as popular as it
should be):

```
./install_gadget.py --all --disable-tcl
```

See `--help` for more info.

## Manual gadget installation

You essentially need to get a working installation of the debug adapter, find
out how to start it, and configure that in an `adapters` entry in either your
`.vimspector.json` or in `.gadgets.json`.

The simplest way in practice is to install or start Visusal Studio Code and use
its extension manager to install the relevant extension. You can then configure
the adapter manually in the `adapters` section of your `.vimspector.json` or in
a `gadgets.json`. 

PRs are always welcome to add configuration to do this to `install_gadget.py`.

### The gadget directory

Vimspector uses the following directory by default to look for a file named
`.gadgets.json`: `</path/to/vimspector>/gadgets/<os>`.

This path is exposed as the vimspector _variable_ `${gadgetDir}`. This is useful
for configuring gadget command lines.

Where os is one of:

* `macos`
* `linux`
* `windows` (though note: Windows is not supported)

The format is the same as `.vimspector.json`, but only the `adapters` key is
used:

Example:

```json
{
  "adapters": {
    "lldb-vscode": {
      "variables": {
        "LLVM": {
          "shell": "brew --prefix llvm"
        }
      },
      "attach": {
        "pidProperty": "pid",
        "pidSelect": "ask"
      },
      "command": [
        "${LLVM}/bin/lldb-vscode"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LLDB_LAUNCH_FLAG_LAUNCH_IN_TTY": "YES"
      },
      "name": "lldb"
    },
    "vscode-cpptools": {
      "attach": {
        "pidProperty": "processId", 
        "pidSelect": "ask"
      }, 
      "command": [
        "${gadgetDir}/vscode-cpptools/debugAdapters/OpenDebugAD7"
      ], 
      "name": "cppdbg"
    }, 
    "vscode-python": {
      "command": [
        "node", 
        "${gadgetDir}/vscode-python/out/client/debugger/debugAdapter/main.js"
      ], 
      "name": "vscode-python"
    }
  }
}
```

The gadget file is automatically written by `install_gadget.py`.

Vimspector will also load any fies matching:
`</path/to/vimspector>/gadgets/<os>/.gadgets.d/*.json`. These have the same
format as `.gadgets.json` but are not overwritten when running
`install_gadget.py`.

# About

## Background

The motivation is that debugging in Vim is a pretty horrible experience,
particularly if you use multiple languages. With pyclewn no more and the
built-in termdebug plugin limited to gdb, I wanted to explore options.

While Language Server Protocol is well known, the Debug Adapter Protocol is less
well known, but achieves a similar goal: language agnostic API abstracting
debuggers from clients.

The aim of this project is to provide a simple but effective debugging
experience in Vim for multiple languages, by leveraging the debug adapters that
are being built for Visual Studio Code.

The ability to do remote debugging is a must. This is key to my workflow, so
baking it in to the debugging experience is a top bill goal for the project. So
vimspector has first-class support for executing programs remotely and attaching
to them. This support is unique to vimspector and on top of (complementary to)
any such support in actual debug adapters.

## Status

Vimspector is a work in progress, and any feedback/contributions are more
than welcome.

The backlog can be [viewed on Trello](https://trello.com/b/yvAKK0rD/vimspector).

In order to use it you have to currently:

- Write a mostly undocumented configuration file that contains essentially
  undocumented parameters.
- Accept that it isn't complete yet
- Work around some frustrating bugs in Vim
- Ignore probably many bugs in vimspector!

### Experimental

The plugin is currently _experimental_. That means that any part of it
can (and probably will) change, including things like:

- breaking changes to the configuration
- keys, layout, functionatlity of the UI

If a large number of people start using it then I will do my best to
minimise this, or at least announce on Gitter.

# Mappings

By default, vimspector does not change any of your mappings. Mappings are very
personal and so you should work out what you like and use vim's powerful mapping
features to set your own mappings. To that end, Vimspector defines the following
`<Plug>` mappings:

* `<Plug>VimspectorContinue`
* `<Plug>VimspectorStop`
* `<Plug>VimspectorRestart`
* `<Plug>VimspectorPause`
* `<Plug>VimspectorToggleBreakpoint`
* `<Plug>VimspectorAddFunctionBreakpoint`
* `<Plug>VimspectorStepOver`
* `<Plug>VimspectorStepInto`
* `<Plug>VimspectorStepOut`

These map 1-1 with the API functions below.

For example, if you want `<F5>` to start/continue debugging, add this to some
appropriate place, such as your `vimrc` (hint: run `:e $MYVIMRC`).

```viml
nmap <F5> <Plug>VimspectorContinue
```

That said, many people are familiar with particular debuggers, so the following
mappings can be enabled by setting `g:vimspector_enable_mappings` to the
specified value.

Please note: Currently there are no `<plug>` mappings. These will be added in
future to make custom mappings much easier.

## Visual Studio / VSCode

To use Visual Studio-like mappings, add the following to your `vimrc` **before
loading vimspector**:

```viml
let g:vimspector_enable_mappings = 'VISUAL_STUDIO'
```

| Key               | Function                                                  | API |
| ---               | ---                                                       | --- |
| `F5`              | When debugging, continue. Otherwise start debugging.      | `vimspector#Continue()` |
| `Shift F5`        | Stop debugging.                                           | `vimspector#Stop()` |
| `Ctrl Shift F5`   | Restart debugging with the same configuration.            | `vimspector#Restart()` |
| `F6`              | Pause debugee.                                            | `vimspector#Pause()` |
| `F9`              | Toggle line breakpoint on the current line.               | `vimspector#ToggleBreakpoint()` |
| `Shift F9`        | Add a function breakpoint for the expression under cursor | `vimspector#AddFunctionBreakpoint( '<cexpr>' )` |
| `F10`             | Step Over                                                 | `vimspector#StepOver()` |
| `F11`             | Step Into                                                 | `vimspector#StepInto()` |
| `Shift F11`       | Step out of current function scope                        | `vimspector#StepOut()` |

## Human Mode

If, like me, you only have 2 hands and 10 fingers, you probably don't like
Ctrl-Shift-F keys. Also, if you're running in a terminal, there's a real
possibility of terminfo being wrong for shifted-F-keys, particularly if your
`TERM` is `screen-256color`. If these issues (number of hands, `TERM` variables)
are unfixable, try the following mappings, by adding the following **before
loading vimspector**:

```viml
let g:vimspector_enable_mappings = 'HUMAN'
```

| Key   | Function                                                  | API |
| ---   | ---                                                       | --- |
| `F5`  | When debugging, continue. Otherwise start debugging.      | `vimspector#Continue()` |
| `F3`  | Stop debugging.                                           | `vimspector#Stop()` |
| `F4`  | Restart debugging with the same configuration.            | `vimspector#Restart()` |
| `F6`  | Pause debugee.                                            | `vimspector#Pause()` |
| `F9`  | Toggle line breakpoint on the current line.               | `vimspector#ToggleBreakpoint()` |
| `F8`  | Add a function breakpoint for the expression under cursor | `vimspector#AddFunctionBreakpoint( '<cexpr>' )` |
| `F10` | Step Over                                                 | `vimspector#StepOver()` |
| `F11` | Step Into                                                 | `vimspector#StepInto()` |
| `F12` | Step out of current function scope                        | `vimspector#StepOut()` |

# Usage

## Launch and attach by PID:

* Create `vimspector.json`. See [below](#supported-languages).
* `:call vimspector#Launch()` and select a configuration.

## Breakpoints

* Use `vimspector#ToggleBreakpoint()` to set/disable/delete a line breakpoint.
* Use `vimspector#AddFunctionBreakpoint( '<name>' )` to add a function
breakpoint.

## Stepping

* Step in/out, finish, continue, pause etc. using the WinBar.
* If you really want to, the API is `vimspector#StepInto()` etc.

## Variables and scopes

* Current scope shows values of locals.
* Use `<CR>` to expand/collapse (+, -).
* When changing the stack frame the locals window updates.
* While paused, hover to see values

## Watches

The watches window is a prompt buffer, where that's available. Enter insert mode
to add a new watch expression.

* Add watches to the variables window by entering insert mode and
  typing the expression. Commit with `<CR>`.
* Alternatively, use `:VimspectorWatch <expression>`. Tab-completion for
  expression is available in some debug adapters.
* Expand result with `<CR>`.
* Delete with `<DEL>`.

## Stack Traces

* In the threads window, use `<CR>` to expand/collapse.
* Use `<CR>` on a stack frame to jump to it.

## Program Output

* In the outputs window use the WinBar to select the output channel.
* Alternatively, use `:VimspectorShowOutput <category>`. Use command-line
  completion to see the categories.
* The debugee prints to the stdout channel.
* Other channels may be useful for debugging.

### Console

The console window is a prompt buffer, where that's available, and can be used
as an interactive CLI for the debug adapter. Support for this varies amongt
adapters.

* Enter insert mode to enter a command to evaluate. 
* Alternatively, `:VimspectorEval <expression>`. Completion is available with
  some debug adapters.
* Commit the request with `<CR>`
* The request and subsequent result are printed.

NOTE: See also [Watches](#watches) above.

## Closing debugger

To close the debugger, use:

* `Reset` WinBar button (`set mouse=a`)
* `:VimspectorReset` when the WinBar is not available.
* `call vimspector#Reset()`

# Debug adapter configuration

## Supported Languages

For more information on the configuration of `.vimspector.json`, take a look at
the Getting Started section of the [Vimspector website][website].

Current tested with the following debug adapters.

* C++: [vscode-cpptools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools)

***NOTE FOR macOS USERS***: Currently VSCode cpptools does *not* work on macOS
(see this issue: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/3829).
Therefore it is highly recommended to use `lldb-vscode`, which comes with llvm.
Here's how:

* Install llvm with HomeBrew: `brew install llvm`
* Create a file named
  `/path/to/vimspector/gadgets/macos/.gadgets.d/lldb-vscode.json`:

```json

{
  "adapters": {
    "lldb-vscode": {
      "variables": {
        "LLVM": {
          "shell": "brew --prefix llvm"
        }
      },
      "attach": {
        "pidProperty": "pid",
        "pidSelect": "ask"
      },
      "command": [
        "${LLVM}/bin/lldb-vscode"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LLDB_LAUNCH_FLAG_LAUNCH_IN_TTY": "YES"
      },
      "name": "lldb"
    }
  }
}
```

Example `.vimspector.json` (works with both `vscode-cpptools` and `lldb-vscode`.
For `lldb-vscode` replace the name of the adapter with `lldb-vscode`):

```
{
  "configurations": {
    "<name>: Launch": {
      "adapter": "vscode-cpptools",
      "configuration": {
        "name": "<name>",
        "type": "cppdbg",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "<path to binary>",
        "args": [ ... ],
        "cwd": "<working directory>",
        "environment": [ ... ],
        "externalConsole": true,
        "MIMode": "lldb"
      }
    },
    "<name>: Attach": {
      "adapter": "vscode-cpptools",
      "configuration": {
        "name": "<name>: Attach",
        "type": "cppdbg",
        "request": "attach",
        "program": "<path to binary>",
        "MIMode": "lldb"
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

* Python: [vscode-python](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python)

```
{
  "configurations": {
    "<name>: Launch": {
      "adapter": "vscode-python",
      "configuration": {
        "name": "<name>: Launch",
        "type": "python",
        "request": "launch",
        "cwd": "<working directory>",
        "stopOnEntry": true,
        "console": "externalTerminal",
        "debugOptions": [],
        "program": "<path to main python file>"
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

* TCL (TclProDebug)

See [my fork of TclProDebug](https://github.com/puremourning/TclProDebug) for instructions.

* C# - dotnet core

Requires `install_gadget.py --force-enable-c-sharp`

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "launch - netcoredbg": {
      "adapter": "netcoredbg",
      "configuration": {
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${workspaceRoot}/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.2/csharp.dll",
        "args": [],
        "stopAtEntry": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* C# - mono

Requires `install_gadget.py --force-enable-c-sharp`.

***Known not to work.****

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "launch - mono": {
      "adapter": "vscode-mono-debug",
      "configuration": {
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${workspaceRoot}/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.2/csharp.dll",
        "args": [],
        "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
        "runtimeExecutable": "mono",
        "runtimeArgs": [],

        "externalConsole": false,
        "console": "integratedTerminal"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* Go 

Requires:

* `install_gadget.py --enable-go`
* [Delve][delve-install] installed, e.g. `go get -u github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv`
* Delve to be in your PATH, or specify the `dlvToolPath` launch option

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "run": {
      "adapter": "vscode-go",
      "configuration": {
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${fileDirname}",
        "mode": "debug",
        "dlvToolPath": "$HOME/go/bin/dlv"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* Node.js

Requires:

* `install_gadget.py --force-enable-node`
* For installation, a Node.js environemt that is < node 12. I believe this is an
  incompatibility with gulp. Advice, use [nvm][] with `nvm install --lts 10; nvm
  use --lts 10; ./install_gadget.py --force-enable-node ...`
* Options described here:
  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging
* Example: `support/test/node/simple`

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "run": {
      "adapter": "vscode-node",
      "configuration": {
        "request": "launch",
        "protocol": "auto",
        "stopOnEntry": true,
        "console": "integratedTerminal",
        "program": "${workspaceRoot}/simple.js",
        "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* Chrome

This uses the chrome debugger, see
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome.

It allows you to debug scripts running inside chrome from within Vim.

* `./install_gadget.py --force-enable-chrome`
* Example: `support/test/chrome`

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "launch": {
      "adapter": "chrome",
      "configuration": {
        "request": "launch",
        "url": "http://localhost:1234/",
        "webRoot": "${workspaceRoot}/www"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Also the mock debugger, but that isn't actually useful.

## Partially supported

* Java Debug Server. The [java debug server][java-debug-server] runs as a
  jdt.ls plugin, rather than a standalone debug adapter. This makes a lot
  of sense if you already happen to be running the language server. 
  Vimspector is not in the business of running language servers. So, rather
  than doing so, vimspector simply allows you to start the java debug server
  manually (however you might do so) and you can tell vimspector the port
  on which it is listening. See [this issue](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector/issues/3)
  for more background.

# FAQ

1. Q: Does it work? A: Yeah, sort of. It's _incredibly_ buggy and unpolished.
2. Q: Does it work with _this_ language? A: Probably, but it won't
   necessarily be easy to work out what to put in the `.vimspector.json`. As you
   can see above, some of the servers aren't really editor agnostic, and require
   very-specific unique handling.
