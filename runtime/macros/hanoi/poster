Everyone seems to be writing stupid Tower of Hanoi programs.
Well, here is the stupidest of them all: the hanoi solving vi macros.

Save this article, unshar it, and run uudecode on hanoi.vi.macros.uu.
This will give you the macro file hanoi.vi.macros.
Then run vi (with no file: just type "vi") and type:
	:so hanoi.vi.macros
	g
and watch it go.

The default height of the tower is 7 but can be easily changed by editing
the macro file.

The disks aren't actually shown in this version, only numbers representing
each disk, but I believe it is possible to write some macros to show the
disks moving about as well. Any takers?

(For maze solving macros, see alt.sources or comp.editors)
