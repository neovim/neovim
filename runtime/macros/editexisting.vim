" Vim Plugin:	Edit the file with an existing Vim if possible
" Maintainer:	Bram Moolenaar
" Last Change:	2013 Feb 24

" This is a plugin, drop it in your (Unix) ~/.vim/plugin or (Win32)
" $VIM/vimfiles/plugin directory.  Or make a symbolic link, so that you
" automatically use the latest version.

" This plugin serves two purposes:
" 1. On startup, if we were invoked with one file name argument and the file
"    is not modified then try to find another Vim instance that is editing
"    this file.  If there is one then bring it to the foreground and exit.
" 2. When a file is edited and a swap file exists for it, try finding that
"    other Vim and bring it to the foreground.  Requires Vim 7, because it
"    uses the SwapExists autocommand event.
if v:version < 700
  finish

" Function that finds the Vim instance that is editing "filename" and brings
" it to the foreground.
