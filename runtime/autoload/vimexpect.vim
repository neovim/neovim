" vimexpect.vim is a small object-oriented library that simplifies the task of
" scripting communication with jobs or any interactive program. The name
" `expect` comes from the famous tcl extension that has the same purpose.
"
" This library is built upon two simple concepts: Parsers and States.
"
" A State represents a program state and associates a set of regular
" expressions(to parse program output) with method names(to deal with parsed
" output). States are created with the vimexpect#State(patterns) function.
"
" A Parser manages data received from the program. It also manages State
" objects by storing them into a stack, where the top of the stack is the
" current State. Parsers are created with the vimexpect#Parser(initial_state,
" target) function
"
" The State methods are defined by the user, and are always called with `self`
" set as the Parser target. Advanced control flow is achieved by changing the
" current state with the `push`/`pop`/`switch` parser methods.
"
" An example of this library in action can be found in Neovim source
" code(contrib/neovim_gdb subdirectory)

" is a dictionary that will be the `self` of every State method call associated
" with the parser, and may contain options normally passed to
" `jobstart`(on_stdout/on_stderr will be overriden). Returns the target so it
" can be called directly as the second argument of `jobstart`:
