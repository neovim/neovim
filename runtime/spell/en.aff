#   Changelog:
#
#   2000-01-05  Björn Jacke <bjoern.jacke@gmx.de>
#               - first version with translation rules derived from
#                 metaphone.cc distributed with aspell 0.28.3
#               - "TH" is now representated as "@" because "0" is a
#                 meta character
#               - removed TH(!vowel) --> T; always use TH --> # instead
#               - dropped "^AE" -> "E" (redundant)
#               - "ing" is transformed to "N", not "NK"
#               - "SCH(EO)" transforms to "SK" now
#               - added R --> SILENT if (after a vowel) and no (vowel or
#                 "y" follows) like in "Marcy" or "abort"
#               - H is SILENT in RH at beginning of words
#               - H is SILENT if vowel leads and "Y" follows
#               - some ".OUGH.."  --> ...F exceptions added
#               - "^V" transforms to "W"
#   2000-01-07  Kevin Atkinson <kevinatk@home.com>
