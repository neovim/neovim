--- Tells Vim what to do with characters with East Asian Width Class
--- Ambiguous (such as Euro, Registered Sign, Copyright Sign, Greek
--- letters, Cyrillic letters).
---
--- There are currently two possible values:
--- "single":	Use the same width as characters in US-ASCII.  This is
--- 		expected by most users.
--- "double":	Use twice the width of ASCII characters.
--- 						*E834* *E835*
--- The value "double" cannot be used if 'listchars' or 'fillchars'
--- contains a character that would be double width.  These errors may
--- also be given when calling setcellwidths().
---
--- The values are overruled for characters specified with
--- `setcellwidths()`.
---
--- There are a number of CJK fonts for which the width of glyphs for
--- those characters are solely based on how many octets they take in
--- legacy/traditional CJK encodings.  In those encodings, Euro,
--- Registered sign, Greek/Cyrillic letters are represented by two octets,
--- therefore those fonts have "wide" glyphs for them.  This is also
--- true of some line drawing characters used to make tables in text
--- file.  Therefore, when a CJK font is used for GUI Vim or
--- Vim is running inside a terminal (emulators) that uses a CJK font
--- (or Vim is run inside an xterm invoked with "-cjkwidth" option.),
--- this option should be set to "double" to match the width perceived
--- by Vim with the width of glyphs in the font.  Perhaps it also has
--- to be set to "double" under CJK MS-Windows when the system locale is
--- set to one of CJK locales.  See Unicode Standard Annex #11

--- When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
--- done.  This is a comma-separated list of words.
---
--- The main values are:
--- "yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
--- "no"	rename the file and write a new one
--- "auto"	one of the previous, what works best
---
--- Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
--- "breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
--- "breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing
---
--- Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
--- - Takes extra time to copy the file.
--- + When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
---   has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
--- - When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
---   not of the real file.
---
--- Renaming the file and writing a new one:
--- + It's fast.
--- - Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
---   file.
--- - When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.
---
--- The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming the
--- file is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on
--- and the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected,
--- a copy will be made.
---
--- The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
--- combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
--- force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
--- exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
--- become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
--- useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
--- hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
--- be propagated back to the original source.
--- 						*crontab*
--- One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
--- that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
--- the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
--- backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
--- example.
---
--- When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
--- with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
--- symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file,
--- however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
--- group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
--- fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
--- others.
---
--- When the file is renamed, this is the other way around: The backup has
--- the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
--- is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
--- link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
--- rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
--- written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
--- the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
--- again not rename the file.

--- List of directories for the backup file, separated with commas.
--- - The backup file will be created in the first directory in the list
---   where this is possible.  If none of the directories exist Nvim will
---   attempt to create the last directory in the list.
--- - Empty means that no backup file will be created ('patchmode' is
---   impossible!).  Writing may fail because of this.
--- - A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
---   as the edited file.
--- - A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
---   the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
---   "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
---   ("." inside a directory name has no special meaning).
--- - Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
---   of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
---   name, precede it with a backslash.
--- - To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
--- - A directory name may end in an '/'.
--- - For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
---   the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
---   with all path separators changed to percent '%' signs. This will
---   ensure file name uniqueness in the backup directory.
---   On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
---   separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
---   include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
---   use '//', instead of '\\'.
--- - Environment variables are expanded `:set_env`.
--- - Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
---   get one in the option (see `option-backslash`), for example:
--- ```
---     :set bdir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
--- ```
--- See also 'backup' and 'writebackup' options.
--- If you want to hide your backup files on Unix, consider this value:
--- ```
--- 	:set backupdir=./.backup,~/.backup,.,/tmp
--- ```
--- You must create a ".backup" directory in each directory and in your
--- home directory for this to work properly.
--- The use of `:set+=` and `:set-=` is preferred when adding or removing
--- directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
--- uses another default.
--- This option cannot be set from a `modeline` or in the `sandbox`, for
--- security reasons.

--- Watch out for special characters, see `option-backslash`.
--- When $TMPDIR, $TMP or $TEMP is not defined, it is not used for the

--- Also see `win_gettype()`, which returns the type of the window.
---
--- Be careful with changing this option, it can have many side effects!
--- One such effect is that Vim will not check the timestamp of the file,
--- if the file is changed by another program this will not be noticed.
---
--- A "quickfix" buffer is only used for the error list and the location
--- list.  This value is set by the `:cwindow` and `:lwindow` commands and
--- you are not supposed to change it.
---
--- "nofile" and "nowrite" buffers are similar:
--- both:		The buffer is not to be written to disk, ":w" doesn't
--- 		work (":w filename" does work though).
--- both:		The buffer is never considered to be `'modified'`.
--- 		There is no warning when the changes will be lost, for
--- 		example when you quit Vim.
--- both:		A swap file is only created when using too much memory
--- 		(when 'swapfile' has been reset there is never a swap
--- 		file).
--- nofile only:	The buffer name is fixed, it is not handled like a
--- 		file name.  It is not modified in response to a `:cd`
--- 		command.
--- both:		When using ":e bufname" and already editing "bufname"
--- 		the buffer is made empty and autocommands are
--- 		triggered as usual for `:edit`.
--- 						*E676*
--- "acwrite" implies that the buffer name is not related to a file, like
--- "nofile", but it will be written.  Thus, in contrast to "nofile" and
--- "nowrite", ":w" does work and a modified buffer can't be abandoned
--- without saving.  For writing there must be matching `BufWriteCmd|,
--- |FileWriteCmd` or `FileAppendCmd` autocommands.

--- 	b	"\|" in a ":map" command is recognized as the end of
--- 		the map command.  The '\' is included in the mapping,
--- 		the text after the '|' is interpreted as the next
--- 		command.  Use a CTRL-V instead of a backslash to

--- 		menu commands.  Remove this flag to be able to use a
--- 		backslash like a CTRL-V.  For example, the command

--- 							*cpo-C*
--- 	C	Do not concatenate sourced lines that start with a
--- 		backslash.  See `line-continuation`.
--- 							*cpo-d*
--- 	d	Using "./" in the 'tags' option doesn't mean to use
--- 		the tags file relative to the current file, but the
--- 		tags file in the current directory.
--- 							*cpo-D*
--- 	D	Can't use CTRL-K to enter a digraph after Normal mode
--- 		commands with a character argument, like `r`, `f` and
--- 		`t`.
--- 							*cpo-e*
--- 	e	When executing a register with ":@r", always add a
--- 		<CR> to the last line, also when the register is not
--- 		linewise.  If this flag is not present, the register
--- 		is not linewise and the last line does not end in a
--- 		<CR>, then the last line is put on the command-line
--- 		and can be edited before hitting <CR>.
--- 							*cpo-E*
--- 	E	It is an error when using "y", "d", "c", "g~", "gu" or
--- 		"gU" on an Empty region.  The operators only work when
--- 		at least one character is to be operated on.  Example:
--- 		This makes "y0" fail in the first column.
--- 							*cpo-f*
--- 	f	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
--- 		argument will set the file name for the current buffer,
--- 		if the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet.
--- 							*cpo-F*
--- 	F	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
--- 		argument will set the file name for the current
--- 		buffer, if the current buffer doesn't have a file name
--- 		yet.  Also see `cpo-P`.
--- 							*cpo-i*
--- 	i	When included, interrupting the reading of a file will
--- 		leave it modified.
--- 							*cpo-I*
--- 	I	When moving the cursor up or down just after inserting
--- 		indent for 'autoindent', do not delete the indent.
--- 							*cpo-J*
--- 	J	A `sentence` has to be followed by two spaces after
--- 		the '.', '!' or '?'.  A <Tab> is not recognized as
--- 		white space.
--- 							*cpo-K*
--- 	K	Don't wait for a key code to complete when it is
--- 		halfway through a mapping.  This breaks mapping
--- 		<F1><F1> when only part of the second <F1> has been
--- 		read.  It enables cancelling the mapping by typing
--- 		<F1><Esc>.
--- 							*cpo-l*
--- 	l	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
--- 		literally, only "\]", "\^", "\-" and "\\" are special.
--- 		See `/[]`
--- 		   'l' included: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space>, '\' and 't'
--- 		   'l' excluded: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space> and <Tab>
--- 							*cpo-L*
--- 	L	When the 'list' option is set, 'wrapmargin',
--- 		'textwidth', 'softtabstop' and Virtual Replace mode
--- 		(see `gR`) count a <Tab> as two characters, instead of
--- 		the normal behavior of a <Tab>.
--- 							*cpo-m*
--- 	m	When included, a showmatch will always wait half a
--- 		second.  When not included, a showmatch will wait half
--- 		a second or until a character is typed.  `'showmatch'`
--- 							*cpo-M*
--- 	M	When excluded, "%" matching will take backslashes into
--- 		account.  Thus in "( \( )" and "\( ( \)" the outer
--- 		parenthesis match.  When included "%" ignores
--- 		backslashes, which is Vi compatible.
--- 							*cpo-n*
--- 	n	When included, the column used for 'number' and
--- 		'relativenumber' will also be used for text of wrapped
--- 		lines.
--- 							*cpo-o*
--- 	o	Line offset to search command is not remembered for
--- 		next search.
--- 							*cpo-O*
--- 	O	Don't complain if a file is being overwritten, even
--- 		when it didn't exist when editing it.  This is a
--- 		protection against a file unexpectedly created by
--- 		someone else.  Vi didn't complain about this.
--- 							*cpo-p*
--- 	p	Vi compatible Lisp indenting.  When not present, a
--- 		slightly better algorithm is used.
--- 							*cpo-P*
--- 	P	When included, a ":write" command that appends to a
--- 		file will set the file name for the current buffer, if
--- 		the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet and
--- 		the 'F' flag is also included `cpo-F`.
--- 							*cpo-q*
--- 	q	When joining multiple lines leave the cursor at the
--- 		position where it would be when joining two lines.
--- 							*cpo-r*
--- 	r	Redo ("." command) uses "/" to repeat a search
--- 		command, instead of the actually used search string.
--- 							*cpo-R*
--- 	R	Remove marks from filtered lines.  Without this flag
--- 		marks are kept like `:keepmarks` was used.
--- 							*cpo-s*
--- 	s	Set buffer options when entering the buffer for the
--- 		first time.  This is like it is in Vim version 3.0.
--- 		And it is the default.  If not present the options are
--- 		set when the buffer is created.
--- 							*cpo-S*
--- 	S	Set buffer options always when entering a buffer
--- 		(except 'readonly', 'fileformat', 'filetype' and
--- 		'syntax').  This is the (most) Vi compatible setting.
--- 		The options are set to the values in the current
--- 		buffer.  When you change an option and go to another
--- 		buffer, the value is copied.  Effectively makes the
--- 		buffer options global to all buffers.
---
--- 		's'    'S'     copy buffer options
--- 		no     no      when buffer created
--- 		yes    no      when buffer first entered (default)
--- 		 X     yes     each time when buffer entered (vi comp.)
--- 							*cpo-t*
--- 	t	Search pattern for the tag command is remembered for
--- 		"n" command.  Otherwise Vim only puts the pattern in
--- 		the history for search pattern, but doesn't change the
--- 		last used search pattern.
--- 							*cpo-u*
--- 	u	Undo is Vi compatible.  See `undo-two-ways`.
--- 							*cpo-v*
--- 	v	Backspaced characters remain visible on the screen in
--- 		Insert mode.  Without this flag the characters are
--- 		erased from the screen right away.  With this flag the
--- 		screen newly typed text overwrites backspaced
--- 		characters.
--- 							*cpo-W*
--- 	W	Don't overwrite a readonly file.  When omitted, ":w!"
--- 		overwrites a readonly file, if possible.
--- 							*cpo-x*
--- 	x	<Esc> on the command-line executes the command-line.
--- 		The default in Vim is to abandon the command-line,
--- 		because <Esc> normally aborts a command.  `c_<Esc>`
--- 							*cpo-X*
--- 	X	When using a count with "R" the replaced text is
--- 		deleted only once.  Also when repeating "R" with "."
--- 		and a count.
--- 							*cpo-y*
--- 	y	A yank command can be redone with ".".  Think twice if
--- 		you really want to use this, it may break some
--- 		plugins, since most people expect "." to only repeat a
--- 		change.
--- 							*cpo-Z*
--- 	Z	When using "w!" while the 'readonly' option is set,
--- 		don't reset 'readonly'.
--- 							*cpo-!*
--- 	!	When redoing a filter command, use the last used
--- 		external command, whatever it was.  Otherwise the last
--- 		used -filter- command is used.
--- 							*cpo-$*
--- 	$	When making a change to one line, don't redisplay the
--- 		line, but put a '$' at the end of the changed text.
--- 		The changed text will be overwritten when you type the
--- 		new text.  The line is redisplayed if you type any
--- 		command that moves the cursor from the insertion
--- 		point.
--- 							*cpo-%*
--- 	%	Vi-compatible matching is done for the "%" command.
--- 		Does not recognize "#if", "#endif", etc.
--- 		Does not recognize "/*" and "*/".
--- 		Parens inside single and double quotes are also
--- 		counted, causing a string that contains a paren to
--- 		disturb the matching.  For example, in a line like
--- 		"if (strcmp("foo(", s))" the first paren does not
--- 		match the last one.  When this flag is not included,
--- 		parens inside single and double quotes are treated
--- 		specially.  When matching a paren outside of quotes,
--- 		everything inside quotes is ignored.  When matching a
--- 		paren inside quotes, it will find the matching one (if
--- 		there is one).  This works very well for C programs.
--- 		This flag is also used for other features, such as
--- 		C-indenting.
--- 							*cpo-+*
--- 	+	When included, a ":write file" command will reset the
--- 		'modified' flag of the buffer, even though the buffer
--- 		itself may still be different from its file.
--- 							*cpo->*
--- 	>	When appending to a register, put a line break before
--- 		the appended text.
--- 							*cpo-;*
--- 	;	When using `,` or `;` to repeat the last `t` search
--- 		and the cursor is right in front of the searched
--- 		character, the cursor won't move. When not included,
--- 		the cursor would skip over it and jump to the
--- 		following occurrence.
--- 							*cpo-_*
--- 	_	When using `cw` on a word, do not include the
--- 		whitespace following the word in the motion.

--- Option settings for diff mode.  It can consist of the following items.
--- All are optional.  Items must be separated by a comma.
---
--- 	filler		Show filler lines, to keep the text
--- 			synchronized with a window that has inserted
--- 			lines at the same position.  Mostly useful
--- 			when windows are side-by-side and 'scrollbind'
--- 			is set.
---
--- 	context:{n}	Use a context of {n} lines between a change
--- 			and a fold that contains unchanged lines.
--- 			When omitted a context of six lines is used.
--- 			When using zero the context is actually one,
--- 			since folds require a line in between, also
--- 			for a deleted line.
--- 			See `fold-diff`.
---
--- 	iblank		Ignore changes where lines are all blank.  Adds
--- 			the "-B" flag to the "diff" command if
--- 			'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
--- 			of the "diff" command for what this does
--- 			exactly.
--- 			NOTE: the diff windows will get out of sync,
--- 			because no differences between blank lines are
--- 			taken into account.
---
--- 	icase		Ignore changes in case of text.  "a" and "A"
--- 			are considered the same.  Adds the "-i" flag
--- 			to the "diff" command if 'diffexpr' is empty.
---
--- 	iwhite		Ignore changes in amount of white space.  Adds
--- 			the "-b" flag to the "diff" command if
--- 			'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
--- 			of the "diff" command for what this does
--- 			exactly.  It should ignore adding trailing
--- 			white space, but not leading white space.
---
--- 	iwhiteall	Ignore all white space changes.  Adds
--- 			the "-w" flag to the "diff" command if
--- 			'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
--- 			of the "diff" command for what this does
--- 			exactly.
---
--- 	iwhiteeol	Ignore white space changes at end of line.
--- 			Adds the "-Z" flag to the "diff" command if
--- 			'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
--- 			of the "diff" command for what this does
--- 			exactly.
---
--- 	horizontal	Start diff mode with horizontal splits (unless
--- 			explicitly specified otherwise).
---
--- 	vertical	Start diff mode with vertical splits (unless
--- 			explicitly specified otherwise).
---
--- 	closeoff	When a window is closed where 'diff' is set
--- 			and there is only one window remaining in the
--- 			same tab page with 'diff' set, execute
--- 			`:diffoff` in that window.  This undoes a
--- 			`:diffsplit` command.
---
--- 	hiddenoff	Do not use diff mode for a buffer when it
--- 			becomes hidden.
---
--- 	foldcolumn:{n}	Set the 'foldcolumn' option to {n} when
--- 			starting diff mode.  Without this 2 is used.
---
--- 	followwrap	Follow the 'wrap' option and leave as it is.
---
--- 	internal	Use the internal diff library.  This is
--- 			ignored when 'diffexpr' is set.  *E960*
--- 			When running out of memory when writing a
--- 			buffer this item will be ignored for diffs
--- 			involving that buffer.  Set the 'verbose'
--- 			option to see when this happens.
---
--- 	indent-heuristic
--- 			Use the indent heuristic for the internal
--- 			diff library.
---
--- 	linematch:{n}   Enable a second stage diff on each generated
--- 			hunk in order to align lines. When the total
--- 			number of lines in a hunk exceeds {n}, the
--- 			second stage diff will not be performed as
--- 			very large hunks can cause noticeable lag. A
--- 			recommended setting is "linematch:60", as this
--- 			will enable alignment for a 2 buffer diff with
--- 			hunks of up to 30 lines each, or a 3 buffer
--- 			diff with hunks of up to 20 lines each.
---
--- 	algorithm:{text} Use the specified diff algorithm with the
--- 			internal diff engine. Currently supported
--- 			algorithms are:
--- 			myers      the default algorithm
--- 			minimal    spend extra time to generate the
--- 				   smallest possible diff
--- 			patience   patience diff algorithm
--- 			histogram  histogram diff algorithm
---
--- Examples:
--- ```
--- 	:set diffopt=internal,filler,context:4

--- List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.
---
--- Possible items:
--- - The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is
---   possible.  If it is not possible in any directory, but last
---   directory listed in the option does not exist, it is created.
--- - Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
---   impossible!) and no `E303` error will be given.
--- - A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
---   the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
---   it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
---   attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
--- - A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
---   the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading "."
---   is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
--- - For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
---   the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
---   with all path separators replaced by percent '%' signs (including
---   the colon following the drive letter on Win32). This will ensure
---   file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
---   On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
---   separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
---   include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
---   use '//', instead of '\\'.
--- - Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
---   of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
---   name, precede it with a backslash.
--- - To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
--- - A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
--- - Environment variables are expanded `:set_env`.
--- - Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
---   get one in the option (see `option-backslash`), for example:
--- ```
---     :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
--- ```
--- Editing the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on
--- is discouraged: if the system crashes you lose the swap file. And
--- others on the computer may be able to see the files.
--- Use `:set+=` and `:set-=` when adding or removing directories from the

---
--- WARNING: Conversion to a non-Unicode encoding can cause loss of
--- information!
---
--- See `encoding-names` for the possible values.  Additionally, values may be
--- specified that can be handled by the converter, see
--- `mbyte-conversion`.
---
--- When reading a file 'fileencoding' will be set from 'fileencodings'.
--- To read a file in a certain encoding it won't work by setting
--- 'fileencoding', use the `++enc` argument.  One exception: when
--- 'fileencodings' is empty the value of 'fileencoding' is used.
--- For a new file the global value of 'fileencoding' is used.
---
--- Prepending "8bit-" and "2byte-" has no meaning here, they are ignored.
--- When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
--- you can set it with uppercase values too.  '_' characters are
--- replaced with '-'.  If a name is recognized from the list at
--- `encoding-names`, it is replaced by the standard name.  For example
--- "ISO8859-2" becomes "iso-8859-2".
---
--- When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the 'modified'

---
--- Keep in mind that changing 'fenc' from a modeline happens
--- AFTER the text has been read, thus it applies to when the file will be

--- This is a list of character encodings considered when starting to edit
--- an existing file.  When a file is read, Vim tries to use the first
--- mentioned character encoding.  If an error is detected, the next one
--- in the list is tried.  When an encoding is found that works,
--- 'fileencoding' is set to it.  If all fail, 'fileencoding' is set to
--- an empty string, which means that UTF-8 is used.
--- 	WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information! You can use
--- 	the `++bad` argument to specify what is done with characters
--- 	that can't be converted.
--- For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
--- will work and the first entry of 'fileencodings' will be used (except
--- "ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
--- another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
--- preferred encoding is to be used.  Example:
--- ```
--- 	au BufReadPost * if search('\S', 'w') == 0 |
--- 		\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
--- ```
--- This sets 'fileencoding' to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
--- non-blank characters.
--- When the `++enc` argument is used then the value of 'fileencodings' is
--- not used.
--- Note that 'fileencodings' is not used for a new file, the global value
--- of 'fileencoding' is used instead.  You can set it with:
--- ```
--- 	:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
--- ```
--- This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
--- an empty file.
--- The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
--- (Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
--- by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
--- An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
--- because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
--- accepted.
--- The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
--- environment.  It is useful when your environment uses a non-latin1
--- encoding, such as Russian.
--- When a file contains an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence it won't be
--- recognized as "utf-8".  You can use the `8g8` command to find the
--- illegal byte sequence.
--- WRONG VALUES:			WHAT'S WRONG:
--- 	latin1,utf-8		"latin1" will always be used
--- 	utf-8,ucs-bom,latin1	BOM won't be recognized in an utf-8
--- 				file
--- 	cp1250,latin1		"cp1250" will always be used

--- - When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
---   is opened.  'fileformat' is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
---   'fileformats' name will be used when a file is read into an existing
---   buffer, no matter what 'fileformat' for that buffer is set to.
--- - When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
---   <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
---   edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
---   1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and 'fileformats' includes "dos",
---      'fileformat' is set to "dos".
---   2. If a <NL> is found and 'fileformats' includes "unix", 'fileformat'
---      is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
---      preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
---   3. If 'fileformat' has not yet been set, and if a <CR> is found, and
---      if 'fileformats' includes "mac", 'fileformat' is set to "mac".
---      This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
---       "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
---       "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.
---      Except: if "unix" was chosen, but there is a <CR> before
---      the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
---      the first few lines, "mac" is used.
---   4. If 'fileformat' is still not set, the first name from
---      'fileformats' is used.
---   When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
---   this happens like 'fileformat' has been set appropriately for that
---   file only, the option is not changed.
--- When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformats' is not used.
---
--- When Vim starts up with an empty buffer the first item is used.  You
--- can overrule this by setting 'fileformat' in your .vimrc.
---
--- For systems with a Dos-like <EOL> (<CR><NL>), when reading files that
--- are ":source"ed and for vimrc files, automatic <EOL> detection may be
--- done:
--- - When 'fileformats' is empty, there is no automatic detection.  Dos
---   format will be used.
--- - When 'fileformats' is set to one or more names, automatic detection
---   is done.  This is based on the first <NL> in the file: If there is a
---   <CR> in front of it, Dos format is used, otherwise Unix format is
---   used.

--- When this option is set, the FileType autocommand event is triggered.

--- Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current file type.
--- This option is normally set when the file type is detected.  To enable
--- this use the ":filetype on" command. `:filetype`
--- Setting this option to a different value is most useful in a modeline,
--- for a file for which the file type is not automatically recognized.
--- Example, for in an IDL file:
--- ```
--- 	/* vim: set filetype=idl : */

--- `FileType` `filetypes`
--- When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype

--- This will use the "c" filetype first, then the "doxygen" filetype.
--- This works both for filetype plugins and for syntax files.  More than
--- one dot may appear.

--- Expression which is evaluated to format a range of lines for the `gq`
--- operator or automatic formatting (see 'formatoptions').  When this
--- option is empty 'formatprg' is used.
---
--- The `v:lnum`  variable holds the first line to be formatted.
--- The `v:count` variable holds the number of lines to be formatted.
--- The `v:char`  variable holds the character that is going to be
--- 	      inserted if the expression is being evaluated due to
--- 	      automatic formatting.  This can be empty.  Don't insert
--- 	      it yet!
---
--- Example:
--- ```
--- 	:set formatexpr=mylang#Format()
--- ```
--- This will invoke the mylang#Format() function in the
--- autoload/mylang.vim file in 'runtimepath'. `autoload`
---
--- The expression is also evaluated when 'textwidth' is set and adding
--- text beyond that limit.  This happens under the same conditions as
--- when internal formatting is used.  Make sure the cursor is kept in the
--- same spot relative to the text then!  The `mode()` function will
--- return "i" or "R" in this situation.
---
--- When the expression evaluates to non-zero Vim will fall back to using
--- the internal format mechanism.
---
--- If the expression starts with s: or `<SID>`, then it is replaced with
--- the script ID (`local-function`). Example:
--- ```
--- 	set formatexpr=s:MyFormatExpr()
--- 	set formatexpr=<SID>SomeFormatExpr()
--- ```
--- Otherwise, the expression is evaluated in the context of the script
--- where the option was set, thus script-local items are available.
---
--- The expression will be evaluated in the `sandbox` when set from a
--- modeline, see `sandbox-option`.  That stops the option from working,
--- since changing the buffer text is not allowed.

--- 	  \,sm:block-blinkwait175-blinkoff150-blinkon175
---
--- ```
--- The option is a comma-separated list of parts.  Each part consists of a
--- mode-list and an argument-list:
--- 	mode-list:argument-list,mode-list:argument-list,..
--- The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes:
--- 	n	Normal mode
--- 	v	Visual mode
--- 	ve	Visual mode with 'selection' "exclusive" (same as 'v',
--- 		if not specified)
--- 	o	Operator-pending mode
--- 	i	Insert mode
--- 	r	Replace mode
--- 	c	Command-line Normal (append) mode
--- 	ci	Command-line Insert mode
--- 	cr	Command-line Replace mode
--- 	sm	showmatch in Insert mode
--- 	a	all modes
--- The argument-list is a dash separated list of these arguments:
--- 	hor{N}	horizontal bar, {N} percent of the character height
--- 	ver{N}	vertical bar, {N} percent of the character width
--- 	block	block cursor, fills the whole character
--- 		- Only one of the above three should be present.
--- 		- Default is "block" for each mode.
--- 	blinkwait{N}				*cursor-blinking*
--- 	blinkon{N}
--- 	blinkoff{N}
--- 		blink times for cursor: blinkwait is the delay before
--- 		the cursor starts blinking, blinkon is the time that
--- 		the cursor is shown and blinkoff is the time that the
--- 		cursor is not shown.  Times are in msec.  When one of
--- 		the numbers is zero, there is no blinking. E.g.:
--- ```
--- 			:set guicursor=n:blinkon0
--- ```
--- - Default is "blinkon0" for each mode.
--- 	{group-name}
--- 		Highlight group that decides the color and font of the
--- 		cursor.
--- 		In the `TUI`:
--- 		- `inverse`/reverse and no group-name are interpreted
--- 		  as "host-terminal default cursor colors" which
--- 		  typically means "inverted bg and fg colors".
--- 		- `ctermfg` and `guifg` are ignored.
--- 	{group-name}/{group-name}
--- 		Two highlight group names, the first is used when
--- 		no language mappings are used, the other when they
--- 		are. `language-mapping`
---
--- Examples of parts:
---    n-c-v:block-nCursor	In Normal, Command-line and Visual mode, use a
--- 			block cursor with colors from the "nCursor"
--- 			highlight group
---    n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25-Cursor,r-cr-o:hor20
--- 			In Normal et al. modes, use a block cursor
--- 			with the default colors defined by the host
--- 			terminal.  In Insert-likes modes, use
--- 			a vertical bar cursor with colors from
--- 			"Cursor" highlight group.  In Replace-likes
--- 			modes, use a underline cursor with
--- 			default colors.
---    i-ci:ver30-iCursor-blinkwait300-blinkon200-blinkoff150
--- 			In Insert and Command-line Insert mode, use a
--- 			30% vertical bar cursor with colors from the
--- 			"iCursor" highlight group.  Blink a bit
--- 			faster.
---
--- The 'a' mode is different.  It will set the given argument-list for
--- all modes.  It does not reset anything to defaults.  This can be used
--- to do a common setting for all modes.  For example, to switch off
--- blinking: "a:blinkon0"
---
--- Examples of cursor highlighting:
--- ```
---     :highlight Cursor gui=reverse guifg=NONE guibg=NONE
---     :highlight Cursor gui=NONE guifg=bg guibg=fg

--- This is a list of fonts which will be used for the GUI version of Vim.
--- In its simplest form the value is just one font name.  When
--- the font cannot be found you will get an error message.  To try other
--- font names a list can be specified, font names separated with commas.
--- The first valid font is used.
---
--- Spaces after a comma are ignored.  To include a comma in a font name
--- precede it with a backslash.  Setting an option requires an extra
--- backslash before a space and a backslash.  See also
--- `option-backslash`.  For example:
--- ```
---     :set guifont=Screen15,\ 7x13,font\\,with\\,commas
--- ```
--- will make Vim try to use the font "Screen15" first, and if it fails it
--- will try to use "7x13" and then "font,with,commas" instead.
---
--- If none of the fonts can be loaded, Vim will keep the current setting.
--- If an empty font list is given, Vim will try using other resource
--- settings (for X, it will use the Vim.font resource), and finally it
--- will try some builtin default which should always be there ("7x13" in
--- the case of X).  The font names given should be "normal" fonts.  Vim
--- will try to find the related bold and italic fonts.
---
--- For Win32 and Mac OS:
--- ```
---     :set guifont=*
--- ```
--- will bring up a font requester, where you can pick the font you want.
---
--- The font name depends on the GUI used.
---
--- For Mac OSX you can use something like this:
--- ```
---     :set guifont=Monaco:h10
--- ```
--- *E236*
--- Note that the fonts must be mono-spaced (all characters have the same
--- width).
---
--- To preview a font on X11, you might be able to use the "xfontsel"
--- program.  The "xlsfonts" program gives a list of all available fonts.
---
--- For the Win32 GUI					*E244* *E245*
--- - takes these options in the font name:
--- 	hXX - height is XX (points, can be floating-point)
--- 	wXX - width is XX (points, can be floating-point)
--- 	b   - bold
--- 	i   - italic
--- 	u   - underline
--- 	s   - strikeout
--- 	cXX - character set XX.  Valid charsets are: ANSI, ARABIC,
--- 	      BALTIC, CHINESEBIG5, DEFAULT, EASTEUROPE, GB2312, GREEK,
--- 	      HANGEUL, HEBREW, JOHAB, MAC, OEM, RUSSIAN, SHIFTJIS,
--- 	      SYMBOL, THAI, TURKISH, VIETNAMESE ANSI and BALTIC.
--- 	      Normally you would use "cDEFAULT".
---
---   Use a ':' to separate the options.
--- - A '_' can be used in the place of a space, so you don't need to use
---   backslashes to escape the spaces.
--- - Examples:
--- ```
---     :set guifont=courier_new:h12:w5:b:cRUSSIAN

---
--- Valid letters are as follows:
--- 						*guioptions_a* *'go-a'*
---   'a'	Autoselect:  If present, then whenever VISUAL mode is started,
--- 	or the Visual area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of
--- 	the windowing system's global selection.  This means that the
--- 	Visually highlighted text is available for pasting into other
--- 	applications as well as into Vim itself.  When the Visual mode
--- 	ends, possibly due to an operation on the text, or when an
--- 	application wants to paste the selection, the highlighted text
--- 	is automatically yanked into the "* selection register.
--- 	Thus the selection is still available for pasting into other
--- 	applications after the VISUAL mode has ended.
--- 	    If not present, then Vim won't become the owner of the
--- 	windowing system's global selection unless explicitly told to
--- 	by a yank or delete operation for the "* register.
--- 	The same applies to the modeless selection.
--- 							*'go-P'*
---   'P'	Like autoselect but using the "+ register instead of the "*
--- 	register.
--- 							*'go-A'*
---   'A'	Autoselect for the modeless selection.  Like 'a', but only
--- 	applies to the modeless selection.
---
--- 	    'guioptions'   autoselect Visual  autoselect modeless ~
--- 		 ""		 -			 -
--- 		 "a"		yes			yes
--- 		 "A"		 -			yes
--- 		 "aA"		yes			yes
---
--- 							*'go-c'*
---   'c'	Use console dialogs instead of popup dialogs for simple
--- 	choices.
--- 							*'go-d'*
---   'd'	Use dark theme variant if available.
--- 							*'go-e'*
---   'e'	Add tab pages when indicated with 'showtabline'.
--- 	'guitablabel' can be used to change the text in the labels.
--- 	When 'e' is missing a non-GUI tab pages line may be used.
--- 	The GUI tabs are only supported on some systems, currently
--- 	Mac OS/X and MS-Windows.
--- 							*'go-i'*
---   'i'	Use a Vim icon.
--- 							*'go-m'*
---   'm'	Menu bar is present.
--- 							*'go-M'*
---   'M'	The system menu "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim" is not sourced.  Note
--- 	that this flag must be added in the vimrc file, before
--- 	switching on syntax or filetype recognition (when the `gvimrc`
--- 	file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded; the
--- 	`:syntax on` and `:filetype on` commands load the menu too).
--- 							*'go-g'*
---   'g'	Grey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.  If
--- 	'g' is not included inactive menu items are not shown at all.
--- 							*'go-T'*
---   'T'	Include Toolbar.  Currently only in Win32 GUI.
--- 							*'go-r'*
---   'r'	Right-hand scrollbar is always present.
--- 							*'go-R'*
---   'R'	Right-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
--- 	split window.
--- 							*'go-l'*
---   'l'	Left-hand scrollbar is always present.
--- 							*'go-L'*
---   'L'	Left-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
--- 	split window.
--- 							*'go-b'*
---   'b'	Bottom (horizontal) scrollbar is present.  Its size depends on
--- 	the longest visible line, or on the cursor line if the 'h'
--- 	flag is included. `gui-horiz-scroll`
--- 							*'go-h'*
---   'h'	Limit horizontal scrollbar size to the length of the cursor
--- 	line.  Reduces computations. `gui-horiz-scroll`
---
--- And yes, you may even have scrollbars on the left AND the right if
--- you really want to :-).  See `gui-scrollbars` for more information.
---
--- 							*'go-v'*
---   'v'	Use a vertical button layout for dialogs.  When not included,
--- 	a horizontal layout is preferred, but when it doesn't fit a
--- 	vertical layout is used anyway.  Not supported in GTK 3.
--- 							*'go-p'*
---   'p'	Use Pointer callbacks for X11 GUI.  This is required for some
--- 	window managers.  If the cursor is not blinking or hollow at
--- 	the right moment, try adding this flag.  This must be done
--- 	before starting the GUI.  Set it in your `gvimrc`.  Adding or
--- 	removing it after the GUI has started has no effect.
--- 							*'go-k'*
---   'k'	Keep the GUI window size when adding/removing a scrollbar, or
--- 	toolbar, tabline, etc.  Instead, the behavior is similar to
--- 	when the window is maximized and will adjust 'lines' and
--- 	'columns' to fit to the window.  Without the 'k' flag Vim will
--- 	try to keep 'lines' and 'columns' the same when adding and
--- 	removing GUI components.

--- Also used for the `gf` command if an unmodified file name can't be

--- Also used for `<cfile>`.
---
--- If the expression starts with s: or `<SID>`, then it is replaced with

--- Vim only searches for about half a second.  With a complicated

--- avoid that Vim hangs while you are typing the pattern.
--- The `hl-IncSearch` highlight group determines the highlighting.
--- When 'hlsearch' is on, all matched strings are highlighted too while
--- typing a search command. See also: 'hlsearch'.
--- If you don't want to turn 'hlsearch' on, but want to highlight all

--- when the expression is evaluated (but it may be moved around).
---
--- If the expression starts with s: or `<SID>`, then it is replaced with

--- ```
--- 	set indentexpr=s:MyIndentExpr()
--- 	set indentexpr=<SID>SomeIndentExpr()
--- ```
--- Otherwise, the expression is evaluated in the context of the script
--- where the option was set, thus script-local items are available.
---
--- The expression must return the number of spaces worth of indent.  It
--- can return "-1" to keep the current indent (this means 'autoindent' is
--- used for the indent).
--- Functions useful for computing the indent are `indent()`, `cindent()`
--- and `lispindent()`.
--- The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!  It must
--- not change the text, jump to another window, etc.  Afterwards the

--- For UTF-8 the characters 0xa0 to 0xff are included as well.
--- Think twice before adding white space to this option.  Although a

--- doesn't know where a file name starts or ends when doing completion.
--- It most likely works better without a space in 'isfname'.
---
--- Note that on systems using a backslash as path separator, Vim tries to
--- do its best to make it work as you would expect.  That is a bit
--- tricky, since Vi originally used the backslash to escape special
--- characters.  Vim will not remove a backslash in front of a normal file
--- name character on these systems, but it will on Unix and alikes.  The
--- '&' and '^' are not included by default, because these are special for
--- cmd.exe.
---
--- The format of this option is a list of parts, separated with commas.
--- Each part can be a single character number or a range.  A range is two
--- character numbers with '-' in between.  A character number can be a
--- decimal number between 0 and 255 or the ASCII character itself (does
--- not work for digits).  Example:
--- 	"_,-,128-140,#-43"	(include '_' and '-' and the range
--- 				128 to 140 and '#' to 43)
--- If a part starts with '^', the following character number or range
--- will be excluded from the option.  The option is interpreted from left
--- to right.  Put the excluded character after the range where it is
--- included.  To include '^' itself use it as the last character of the
--- option or the end of a range.  Example:
--- 	"^a-z,#,^"	(exclude 'a' to 'z', include '#' and '^')
--- If the character is '@', all characters where isalpha() returns TRUE
--- are included.  Normally these are the characters a to z and A to Z,
--- plus accented characters.  To include '@' itself use "@-@".  Examples:
--- 	"@,^a-z"	All alphabetic characters, excluding lower
--- 			case ASCII letters.
--- 	"a-z,A-Z,@-@"	All letters plus the '@' character.
--- A comma can be included by using it where a character number is
--- expected.  Example:
--- 	"48-57,,,_"	Digits, comma and underscore.
--- A comma can be excluded by prepending a '^'.  Example:
--- 	" -~,^,,9"	All characters from space to '~', excluding
--- 			comma, plus <Tab>.

--- Parameters for `:mkspell`.  This tunes when to start compressing the
--- word tree.  Compression can be slow when there are many words, but
--- it's needed to avoid running out of memory.  The amount of memory used
--- per word depends very much on how similar the words are, that's why
--- this tuning is complicated.
---
--- There are three numbers, separated by commas:
--- ```
--- 	{start},{inc},{added}

--- For most languages the uncompressed word tree fits in memory.  {start}
--- gives the amount of memory in Kbyte that can be used before any
--- compression is done.  It should be a bit smaller than the amount of
--- memory that is available to Vim.
---
--- When going over the {start} limit the {inc} number specifies the
--- amount of memory in Kbyte that can be allocated before another
--- compression is done.  A low number means compression is done after
--- less words are added, which is slow.  A high number means more memory
--- will be allocated.
---
--- After doing compression, {added} times 1024 words can be added before
--- the {inc} limit is ignored and compression is done when any extra
--- amount of memory is needed.  A low number means there is a smaller
--- chance of hitting the {inc} limit, less memory is used but it's
--- slower.

--- Sets the model to use for the mouse.  The name mostly specifies what
--- the right mouse button is used for:
---    extend	Right mouse button extends a selection.  This works
--- 		like in an xterm.
---    popup	Right mouse button pops up a menu.  The shifted left
--- 		mouse button extends a selection.  This works like
--- 		with Microsoft Windows.
---    popup_setpos Like "popup", but the cursor will be moved to the
--- 		position where the mouse was clicked, and thus the
--- 		selected operation will act upon the clicked object.
--- 		If clicking inside a selection, that selection will
--- 		be acted upon, i.e. no cursor move.  This implies of
--- 		course, that right clicking outside a selection will
--- 		end Visual mode.
--- Overview of what button does what for each model:
--- mouse		    extend		popup(_setpos) ~
--- left click	    place cursor	place cursor
--- left drag	    start selection	start selection
--- shift-left	    search word		extend selection
--- right click	    extend selection	popup menu (place cursor)
--- right drag	    extend selection	-
--- middle click	    paste		paste
---
--- In the "popup" model the right mouse button produces a pop-up menu.
--- Nvim creates a default `popup-menu` but you can redefine it.
---
--- Note that you can further refine the meaning of buttons with mappings.
--- See `mouse-overview`.  But mappings are NOT used for modeless selection.
---
--- Example:
--- ```
---    :map <S-LeftMouse>     <RightMouse>
---    :map <S-LeftDrag>      <RightDrag>
---    :map <S-LeftRelease>   <RightRelease>
---    :map <2-S-LeftMouse>   <2-RightMouse>
---    :map <2-S-LeftDrag>    <2-RightDrag>
---    :map <2-S-LeftRelease> <2-RightRelease>
---    :map <3-S-LeftMouse>   <3-RightMouse>
---    :map <3-S-LeftDrag>    <3-RightDrag>

---    :map <4-S-LeftDrag>    <4-RightDrag>
---    :map <4-S-LeftRelease> <4-RightRelease>
--- ```
--- Mouse commands requiring the CTRL modifier can be simulated by typing
--- the "g" key before using the mouse:
---     "g<LeftMouse>"  is "<C-LeftMouse>	(jump to tag under mouse click)
---     "g<RightMouse>" is "<C-RightMouse>	("CTRL-T")

--- This option controls the number of lines / columns to scroll by when
--- scrolling with a mouse. The option is a comma separated list of parts.
--- Each part consists of a direction and a count as follows:
--- 	direction:count,direction:count
--- Direction is one of either "hor" or "ver". "hor" controls horizontal
--- scrolling and "ver" controls vertical scrolling. Count sets the amount
--- to scroll by for the given direction, it should be a non negative
--- integer. Each direction should be set at most once. If a direction
--- is omitted, a default value is used (6 for horizontal scrolling and 3
--- for vertical scrolling). You can disable mouse scrolling by using
--- a count of 0.
---
--- Example:
--- ```
--- 	:set mousescroll=ver:5,hor:2
--- ```

--- This option tells Vim what the mouse pointer should look like in

--- like used for 'guicursor'.  Each part consist of a mode/location-list
--- and an argument-list:
--- 	mode-list:shape,mode-list:shape,..
--- The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes/locations:
--- 		In a normal window: ~
--- 	n	Normal mode
--- 	v	Visual mode
--- 	ve	Visual mode with 'selection' "exclusive" (same as 'v',
--- 		if not specified)
--- 	o	Operator-pending mode
--- 	i	Insert mode
--- 	r	Replace mode
---
--- 		Others: ~
--- 	c	appending to the command-line
--- 	ci	inserting in the command-line
--- 	cr	replacing in the command-line
--- 	m	at the 'Hit ENTER' or 'More' prompts
--- 	ml	idem, but cursor in the last line
--- 	e	any mode, pointer below last window
--- 	s	any mode, pointer on a status line
--- 	sd	any mode, while dragging a status line
--- 	vs	any mode, pointer on a vertical separator line
--- 	vd	any mode, while dragging a vertical separator line
--- 	a	everywhere
---
--- The shape is one of the following:
--- avail	name		looks like ~
--- w x	arrow		Normal mouse pointer
--- w x	blank		no pointer at all (use with care!)
--- w x	beam		I-beam
--- w x	updown		up-down sizing arrows
--- w x	leftright	left-right sizing arrows
--- w x	busy		The system's usual busy pointer
--- w x	no		The system's usual "no input" pointer
---   x	udsizing	indicates up-down resizing
---   x	lrsizing	indicates left-right resizing
---   x	crosshair	like a big thin +
---   x	hand1		black hand
---   x	hand2		white hand
---   x	pencil		what you write with
---   x	question	big ?
---   x	rightup-arrow	arrow pointing right-up
--- w x	up-arrow	arrow pointing up
---   x	<number>	any X11 pointer number (see X11/cursorfont.h)
---
--- The "avail" column contains a 'w' if the shape is available for Win32,
--- x for X11.
--- Any modes not specified or shapes not available use the normal mouse
--- pointer.
---
--- Example:
--- ```
--- 	:set mouseshape=s:udsizing,m:no
--- ```
--- will make the mouse turn to a sizing arrow over the status lines and

--- octal	If included, numbers that start with a zero will be considered
--- 	to be octal.  Example: Using CTRL-A on "007" results in "010".
--- hex	If included, numbers starting with "0x" or "0X" will be
--- 	considered to be hexadecimal.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
--- 	"0x100" results in "0x0ff".
--- bin	If included, numbers starting with "0b" or "0B" will be
--- 	considered to be binary.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
--- 	"0b1000" subtracts one, resulting in "0b0111".
--- unsigned    If included, numbers are recognized as unsigned. Thus a
--- 	leading dash or negative sign won't be considered as part of
--- 	the number.  Examples:
--- 	    Using CTRL-X on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2019"
--- 	    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2021").
--- 	    Using CTRL-A on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2021"

--- ```
--- - To search relative to the directory of the current file, use:

--- - To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
---   commas:
--- ```
--- 	:set path=,,
--- ```
--- - A directory name may end in a ':' or '/'.
--- - Environment variables are expanded `:set_env`.
--- - When using `netrw.vim` URLs can be used.  For example, adding

--- - Search upwards and downwards in a directory tree using "*", "**" and
---   ";".  See `file-searching` for info and syntax.
--- - Careful with '\' characters, type two to get one in the option:

--- ```
--- 	:set path=.,c:/include

--- You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of
--- 'path', see `:checkpath`.
--- The use of `:set+=` and `:set-=` is preferred when adding or removing

--- 	RedrawDebugComposed guibg=Green   redraw event modified by the

--- 					  overlapping grids, etc)
--- 	RedrawDebugRecompose guibg=Red    redraw generated by the
--- 					  compositor itself, due to a
--- 					  grid being moved or deleted.
---     line	introduce a delay after each line drawn on the screen.
--- 		When using the TUI or another single-grid UI, "compositor"
--- 		gives more information and should be preferred (every
--- 		line is processed as a separate event by the compositor)
---     flush	introduce a delay after each "flush" event.
---     nothrottle	Turn off throttling of the message grid. This is an
--- 		optimization that joins many small scrolls to one
--- 		larger scroll when drawing the message area (with
--- 		'display' msgsep flag active).
---     invalid	Enable stricter checking (abort) of inconsistencies
--- 		of the internal screen state. This is mostly
--- 		useful when running nvim inside a debugger (and
--- 		the test suite).

--- Defaults are setup to search these locations:
--- 1. Your home directory, for personal preferences.
---    Given by `stdpath("config")`.  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
--- 2. Directories which must contain configuration files according to
---    `xdg` ($XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, defaults to /etc/xdg).  This also contains
---    preferences from system administrator.
--- 3. Data home directory, for plugins installed by user.
---    Given by `stdpath("data")/site`.  `$XDG_DATA_HOME`
--- 4. nvim/site subdirectories for each directory in $XDG_DATA_DIRS.
---    This is for plugins which were installed by system administrator,
---    but are not part of the Nvim distribution. XDG_DATA_DIRS defaults
---    to /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/, so system administrators are
---    expected to install site plugins to /usr/share/nvim/site.
--- 5. Session state directory, for state data such as swap, backupdir,
---    viewdir, undodir, etc.
---    Given by `stdpath("state")`.  `$XDG_STATE_HOME`
--- 6. $VIMRUNTIME, for files distributed with Nvim.
--- 						*after-directory*
--- 7, 8, 9, 10. In after/ subdirectories of 1, 2, 3 and 4, with reverse
---    ordering.  This is for preferences to overrule or add to the
---    distributed defaults or system-wide settings (rarely needed).
---
--- 						*packages-runtimepath*
--- "start" packages will also be searched (`runtime-search-path`) for
--- runtime files after these, though such packages are not explicitly
--- reported in &runtimepath. But "opt" packages are explicitly added to
--- &runtimepath by `:packadd`.
---
--- Note that, unlike 'path', no wildcards like "**" are allowed.  Normal
--- wildcards are allowed, but can significantly slow down searching for
--- runtime files.  For speed, use as few items as possible and avoid
--- wildcards.
--- See `:runtime`.
--- Example:
--- ```
--- 	:set runtimepath=~/vimruntime,/mygroup/vim,$VIMRUNTIME
--- ```
--- This will use the directory "~/vimruntime" first (containing your
--- personal Nvim runtime files), then "/mygroup/vim", and finally
--- "$VIMRUNTIME" (the default runtime files).
--- You can put a directory before $VIMRUNTIME to find files which replace

--- The following words are available:
---     ver		Bind vertical scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
---     hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
---     jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
--- 		scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
--- 		displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
--- 		around in a window, another 'scrollbind' window may
--- 		reach a position before the start or after the end of
--- 		the buffer.  The offset is not changed though, when
--- 		moving back the 'scrollbind' window will try to scroll
--- 		to the desired position when possible.
--- 		When now making that window the current one, two
--- 		things can be done with the relative offset:
--- 		1. When "jump" is not included, the relative offset is
--- 		   adjusted for the scroll position in the new current
--- 		   window.  When going back to the other window, the
--- 		   new relative offset will be used.
--- 		2. When "jump" is included, the other windows are
--- 		   scrolled to keep the same relative offset.  When
--- 		   going back to the other window, it still uses the

--- character is left out, then the default value is used for that
--- parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
--- the effect of their value.
--- CHAR	VALUE	~
--- 						*shada-!*
--- !	When included, save and restore global variables that start
--- 	with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
--- 	letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
--- 	and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
--- 	read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
--- 						*shada-quote*
--- "	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
--- 	the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
--- 	backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
--- 	start of a comment!
--- 						*shada-%*
--- %	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
--- 	started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
--- 	restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
--- 	buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
--- 	('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
--- 	removable media (`shada-r`) are not saved.
--- 	When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
--- 	number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
--- 	buffers are stored.
--- 						*shada-'*
--- '	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
--- 	are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
--- 	'shada' is non-empty.
--- 	Including this item also means that the `jumplist` and the
--- 	`changelist` are stored in the shada file.
--- 						*shada-/*
--- /	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
--- 	saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
--- 	patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
--- 	'history' is used.
--- 						*shada-:*
--- :	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
--- 	saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
--- 						*shada-<*
--- \<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
--- 	registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
--- 	saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
--- 	Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in KiB.
--- 						*shada-@*
--- @	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
--- 	saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
--- 						*shada-c*
--- c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
--- 	effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and 'encoding' value is fixed
--- 	to UTF-8 as well.
--- 						*shada-f*
--- f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
--- 	to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
--- 	non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
--- 	cursor position (when exiting or when doing `:wshada`).
--- 						*shada-h*
--- h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the shada
--- 	file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
--- 	has been used since the last search command.
--- 						*shada-n*
--- n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
--- 	the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
--- 	'shadafile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
--- 	given here with 'shada'.  Environment variables are
--- 	expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
--- 						*shada-r*
--- r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
--- 	',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
--- 	specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
--- 	stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
--- 	could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
--- 	e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
--- 						*shada-s*
--- s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
--- 	is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
--- 	the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
--- 	unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
--- 	(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
--- 	integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
--- 	2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
--- 	contents size) = 10253 bytes.
---
--- Example:
--- ```
---     :set shada='50,<1000,s100,:0,n~/nvim/shada
--- ```
--- '50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
--- 		edited.
--- <1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
--- 		remembered.
--- s100		Items with contents occupying more then 100 KiB are
--- 		skipped.
--- :0		Command-line history will not be saved.
--- n~/nvim/shada	The name of the file to use is "~/nvim/shada".
--- no /		Since '/' is not specified, the default will be used,
--- 		that is, save all of the search history, and also the
--- 		previous search and substitute patterns.
--- no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.
--- no h		'hlsearch' highlighting will be restored.
---
--- When setting 'shada' from an empty value you can use `:rshada` to

--- Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
--- value also check these options: 'shellpipe', 'shellslash'
--- 'shellredir', 'shellquote', 'shellxquote' and 'shellcmdflag'.
--- It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.  "csh -f".
--- See `option-backslash` about including spaces and backslashes.
--- Environment variables are expanded `:set_env`.
---
--- If the name of the shell contains a space, you need to enclose it in
--- quotes.  Example with quotes:
--- ```
--- 	:set shell=\"c:\program\ files\unix\sh.exe\"\ -f
--- ```
--- Note the backslash before each quote (to avoid starting a comment) and
--- each space (to avoid ending the option value), so better use `:let-&`
--- like this:
--- ```
--- 	:let &shell='"C:\Program Files\unix\sh.exe" -f'
--- ```
--- Also note that the "-f" is not inside the quotes, because it is not
--- part of the command name.
--- 						*shell-unquoting*
--- Rules regarding quotes:
--- 1. Option is split on space and tab characters that are not inside
---    quotes: "abc def" runs shell named "abc" with additional argument
---    "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional
---    arguments (here and below: additional means “additional to
---    'shellcmdflag'”).
--- 2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number:
---    '"abc"', '"a"bc', 'a"b"c', 'ab"c"' and '"a"b"c"' are all equivalent

--- Name of the word list file where words are added for the `zg` and `zw`

--- path, otherwise the file is placed in the current directory.
--- The path may include characters from 'isfname', space, comma and '@'.
--- 							*E765*
--- It may also be a comma-separated list of names.  A count before the
--- `zg` and `zw` commands can be used to access each.  This allows using
--- a personal word list file and a project word list file.
--- When a word is added while this option is empty Vim will set it for
--- you: Using the first directory in 'runtimepath' that is writable.  If
--- there is no "spell" directory yet it will be created.  For the file
--- name the first language name that appears in 'spelllang' is used,
--- ignoring the region.
--- The resulting ".spl" file will be used for spell checking, it does not
--- have to appear in 'spelllang'.
--- Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
--- name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
--- 'spellfile' is set to it, for entries in 'spelllang' only files
--- without region name will be found.
--- This option cannot be set from a `modeline` or in the `sandbox`, for
--- security reasons.

--- A comma-separated list of word list names.  When the 'spell' option is
--- on spellchecking will be done for these languages.  Example:
--- ```
--- 	set spelllang=en_us,nl,medical
--- ```
--- This means US English, Dutch and medical words are recognized.  Words
--- that are not recognized will be highlighted.
--- The word list name must consist of alphanumeric characters, a dash or
--- an underscore.  It should not include a comma or dot.  Using a dash is
--- recommended to separate the two letter language name from a
--- specification.  Thus "en-rare" is used for rare English words.
--- A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
--- the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
--- region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
--- English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
--- Britain. (Note: currently en_au and en_nz dictionaries are older than
--- en_ca, en_gb and en_us).
--- If the name "cjk" is included East Asian characters are excluded from
--- spell checking.  This is useful when editing text that also has Asian
--- words.
--- Note that the "medical" dictionary does not exist, it is just an
--- example of a longer name.
--- 						*E757*
--- As a special case the name of a .spl file can be given as-is.  The
--- first "_xx" in the name is removed and used as the region name
--- (_xx is an underscore, two letters and followed by a non-letter).
--- This is mainly for testing purposes.  You must make sure the correct
--- encoding is used, Vim doesn't check it.
--- How the related spell files are found is explained here: `spell-load`.
---
--- If the `spellfile.vim` plugin is active and you use a language name
--- for which Vim cannot find the .spl file in 'runtimepath' the plugin
--- will ask you if you want to download the file.
---
--- After this option has been set successfully, Vim will source the files
--- "spell/LANG.vim" in 'runtimepath'.  "LANG" is the value of 'spelllang'
--- up to the first character that is not an ASCII letter or number and

--- Methods used for spelling suggestions.  Both for the `z=` command and
--- the `spellsuggest()` function.  This is a comma-separated list of
--- items:
---
--- best		Internal method that works best for English.  Finds
--- 		changes like "fast" and uses a bit of sound-a-like
--- 		scoring to improve the ordering.
---
--- double		Internal method that uses two methods and mixes the
--- 		results.  The first method is "fast", the other method
--- 		computes how much the suggestion sounds like the bad
--- 		word.  That only works when the language specifies
--- 		sound folding.  Can be slow and doesn't always give
--- 		better results.
---
--- fast		Internal method that only checks for simple changes:
--- 		character inserts/deletes/swaps.  Works well for
--- 		simple typing mistakes.
---
--- {number}	The maximum number of suggestions listed for `z=`.
--- 		Not used for `spellsuggest()`.  The number of
--- 		suggestions is never more than the value of 'lines'
--- 		minus two.
---
--- timeout:{millisec}   Limit the time searching for suggestions to
--- 		{millisec} milli seconds.  Applies to the following
--- 		methods.  When omitted the limit is 5000. When
--- 		negative there is no limit.
---
--- file:{filename} Read file {filename}, which must have two columns,
--- 		separated by a slash.  The first column contains the
--- 		bad word, the second column the suggested good word.
--- 		Example:
--- 			theribal/terrible ~
--- 		Use this for common mistakes that do not appear at the
--- 		top of the suggestion list with the internal methods.
--- 		Lines without a slash are ignored, use this for
--- 		comments.
--- 		The word in the second column must be correct,
--- 		otherwise it will not be used.  Add the word to an
--- 		".add" file if it is currently flagged as a spelling
--- 		mistake.
--- 		The file is used for all languages.
---
--- expr:{expr}	Evaluate expression {expr}.  Use a function to avoid
--- 		trouble with spaces.  `v:val` holds the badly spelled
--- 		word.  The expression must evaluate to a List of
--- 		Lists, each with a suggestion and a score.
--- 		Example:
--- 			[['the', 33], ['that', 44]] ~
--- 		Set 'verbose' and use `z=` to see the scores that the
--- 		internal methods use.  A lower score is better.
--- 		This may invoke `spellsuggest()` if you temporarily
--- 		set 'spellsuggest' to exclude the "expr:" part.
--- 		Errors are silently ignored, unless you set the
--- 		'verbose' option to a non-zero value.
---
--- Only one of "best", "double" or "fast" may be used.  The others may
--- appear several times in any order.  Example:
--- ```
--- 	:set sps=file:~/.config/nvim/sugg,best,expr:MySuggest()

--- EXPERIMENTAL
--- When non-empty, this option determines the content of the area to the
--- side of a window, normally containing the fold, sign and number columns.
--- The format of this option is like that of 'statusline'.
---
--- Some of the items from the 'statusline' format are different for
--- 'statuscolumn':
---
--- %l	line number of currently drawn line
--- %r	relative line number of currently drawn line
--- %s	sign column for currently drawn line
--- %C	fold column for currently drawn line
---
--- NOTE: To draw the sign and fold columns, their items must be included in
--- 'statuscolumn'. Even when they are not included, the status column width
--- will adapt to the 'signcolumn' and 'foldcolumn' width.
---
--- The `v:lnum`    variable holds the line number to be drawn.
--- The `v:relnum`  variable holds the relative line number to be drawn.
--- The `v:virtnum` variable is negative when drawing virtual lines, zero
--- 	      when drawing the actual buffer line, and positive when
--- 	      drawing the wrapped part of a buffer line.
---
--- NOTE: The %@ click execute function item is supported as well but the
--- specified function will be the same for each row in the same column.
--- It cannot be switched out through a dynamic 'statuscolumn' format, the
--- handler should be written with this in mind.
---
--- Examples:
--- ```vim
--- 	" Relative number with bar separator and click handlers:
--- 	:set statuscolumn=%@SignCb@%s%=%T%@NumCb@%r│%T
---
--- 	" Right aligned relative cursor line number:
--- 	:let &stc='%=%{v:relnum?v:relnum:v:lnum} '
---
--- 	" Line numbers in hexadecimal for non wrapped part of lines:
--- 	:let &stc='%=%{v:virtnum>0?"":printf("%x",v:lnum)} '
---
--- 	" Human readable line numbers with thousands separator:
--- 	:let &stc='%{substitute(v:lnum,"\\d\\zs\\ze\\'
--- 		   . '%(\\d\\d\\d\\)\\+$",",","g")}'
---
--- 	" Both relative and absolute line numbers with different
--- 	" highlighting for odd and even relative numbers:
--- 	:let &stc='%#NonText#%{&nu?v:lnum:""}' .
--- 	 '%=%{&rnu&&(v:lnum%2)?"\ ".v:relnum:""}' .
--- 	 '%#LineNr#%{&rnu&&!(v:lnum%2)?"\ ".v:relnum:""}'
---

--- When non-empty, this option determines the content of the status line.
--- Also see `status-line`.
---
--- The option consists of printf style '%' items interspersed with
--- normal text.  Each status line item is of the form:
---   %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
--- All fields except the {item} are optional.  A single percent sign can
--- be given as "%%".
---
--- When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,
--- evaluated and the result is used as the option value.  Example:
--- ```
--- 	:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
--- ```
--- The *g:statusline_winid* variable will be set to the `window-ID` of the
--- window that the status line belongs to.
--- The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
--- Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the
--- current window and buffer, while %{} items are evaluated in the
--- context of the window that the statusline belongs to.
---
--- When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
--- empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.
--- When the result contains unprintable characters the result is
--- unpredictable.
---
--- Note that the only effect of 'ruler' when this option is set (and
--- 'laststatus' is 2 or 3) is controlling the output of `CTRL-G`.
---
--- field	    meaning ~
--- -	    Left justify the item.  The default is right justified
--- 	    when minwid is larger than the length of the item.
--- 0	    Leading zeroes in numeric items.  Overridden by "-".
--- minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by "-" & "0".
--- 	    Value must be 50 or less.
--- maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a "<"
--- 	    on the left for text items.  Numeric items will be
--- 	    shifted down to maxwid-2 digits followed by ">"number
--- 	    where number is the amount of missing digits, much like
--- 	    an exponential notation.
--- item	    A one letter code as described below.
---
--- Following is a description of the possible statusline items.  The
--- second character in "item" is the type:
--- 	N for number
--- 	S for string
--- 	F for flags as described below
--- 	- not applicable
---
--- item  meaning ~
--- f S   Path to the file in the buffer, as typed or relative to current
---       directory.
--- F S   Full path to the file in the buffer.
--- t S   File name (tail) of file in the buffer.
--- m F   Modified flag, text is "[+]"; "[-]" if 'modifiable' is off.
--- M F   Modified flag, text is ",+" or ",-".
--- r F   Readonly flag, text is "[RO]".
--- R F   Readonly flag, text is ",RO".
--- h F   Help buffer flag, text is "[help]".
--- H F   Help buffer flag, text is ",HLP".
--- w F   Preview window flag, text is "[Preview]".
--- W F   Preview window flag, text is ",PRV".
--- y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., "[vim]".  See 'filetype'.
--- Y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., ",VIM".  See 'filetype'.
--- q S   "[Quickfix List]", "[Location List]" or empty.
--- k S   Value of "b:keymap_name" or 'keymap' when `:lmap` mappings are
---       being used: "<keymap>"
--- n N   Buffer number.
--- b N   Value of character under cursor.
--- B N   As above, in hexadecimal.
--- o N   Byte number in file of byte under cursor, first byte is 1.
---       Mnemonic: Offset from start of file (with one added)
--- O N   As above, in hexadecimal.
--- l N   Line number.
--- L N   Number of lines in buffer.
--- c N   Column number (byte index).
--- v N   Virtual column number (screen column).
--- V N   Virtual column number as -{num}.  Not displayed if equal to 'c'.
--- p N   Percentage through file in lines as in `CTRL-G`.
--- P S   Percentage through file of displayed window.  This is like the
---       percentage described for 'ruler'.  Always 3 in length, unless
---       translated.
--- S S   'showcmd' content, see 'showcmdloc'.
--- a S   Argument list status as in default title.  ({current} of {max})
---       Empty if the argument file count is zero or one.
--- { NF  Evaluate expression between "%{" and "}" and substitute result.
---       Note that there is no "%" before the closing "}".  The
---       expression cannot contain a "}" character, call a function to
---       work around that.  See `stl-%{` below.
--- `{%` -  This is almost same as "{" except the result of the expression is
---       re-evaluated as a statusline format string.  Thus if the
---       return value of expr contains "%" items they will get expanded.
---       The expression can contain the "}" character, the end of
---       expression is denoted by "%}".
---       For example:
--- ```
--- 	func! Stl_filename() abort
--- 	    return "%t"
--- 	endfunc
--- ```
--- `stl=%{Stl_filename()}`   results in `"%t"`
---         `stl=%{%Stl_filename()%}` results in `"Name of current file"`
--- %} -  End of "{%" expression
--- ( -   Start of item group.  Can be used for setting the width and
---       alignment of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
--- ) -   End of item group.  No width fields allowed.
--- T N   For 'tabline': start of tab page N label.  Use %T or %X to end
---       the label.  Clicking this label with left mouse button switches
---       to the specified tab page.
--- X N   For 'tabline': start of close tab N label.  Use %X or %T to end
---       the label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current
---       tab" label.    Clicking this label with left mouse button closes
---       specified tab page.
--- @ N   Start of execute function label. Use %X or %T to
---       end the label, e.g.: %10@SwitchBuffer@foo.c%X.  Clicking this
---       label runs specified function: in the example when clicking once
---       using left mouse button on "foo.c" "SwitchBuffer(10, 1, 'l',
---       '    ')" expression will be run.  Function receives the
---       following arguments in order:
---       1. minwid field value or zero if no N was specified
---       2. number of mouse clicks to detect multiple clicks
---       3. mouse button used: "l", "r" or "m" for left, right or middle
---          button respectively; one should not rely on third argument
---          being only "l", "r" or "m": any other non-empty string value
---          that contains only ASCII lower case letters may be expected
---          for other mouse buttons
---       4. modifiers pressed: string which contains "s" if shift
---          modifier was pressed, "c" for control, "a" for alt and "m"
---          for meta; currently if modifier is not pressed string
---          contains space instead, but one should not rely on presence
---          of spaces or specific order of modifiers: use `stridx()` to
---          test whether some modifier is present; string is guaranteed
---          to contain only ASCII letters and spaces, one letter per
---          modifier; "?" modifier may also be present, but its presence
---          is a bug that denotes that new mouse button recognition was
---          added without modifying code that reacts on mouse clicks on
---          this label.
---       Use `getmousepos()`.winid in the specified function to get the
---       corresponding window id of the clicked item.
--- \< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
---       No width fields allowed.
--- = -   Separation point between alignment sections.  Each section will
---       be separated by an equal number of spaces.  With one %= what
---       comes after it will be right-aligned.  With two %= there is a
---       middle part, with white space left and right of it.
---       No width fields allowed.
--- # -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
---       Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
---       highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
---       windows.
--- * -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
---       minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
---       The difference between User{N} and StatusLine will be applied to
---       StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
---       The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See `hl-User1..9`
---
--- When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
--- that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
--- when flags are used like in the examples below.
---
--- When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
--- not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
--- become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
--- completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set.
--- ```
--- 	:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
--- ```
--- Beware that an expression is evaluated each and every time the status
--- line is displayed.
--- 			*stl-%{* *g:actual_curbuf* *g:actual_curwin*
--- While evaluating %{} the current buffer and current window will be set
--- temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
--- currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
--- The variable "g:actual_curbuf" is set to the `bufnr()` number of the
--- real current buffer and "g:actual_curwin" to the `window-ID` of the
--- real current window.  These values are strings.
---
--- The 'statusline' option will be evaluated in the `sandbox` if set from
--- a modeline, see `sandbox-option`.
--- This option cannot be set in a modeline when 'modelineexpr' is off.
---
--- It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
--- evaluating 'statusline' `textlock`.
---
--- If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
--- a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
--- using `:redrawstatus`.
---
--- A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
--- Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
--- described above.
---
--- Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
--- If you are stuck, hold down ':' or 'Q' to get a prompt, then quit and
--- edit your vimrc or whatever with "vim --clean" to get it right.
---
--- Examples:
--- Emulate standard status line with 'ruler' set
--- ```
---   :set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
--- ```
--- Similar, but add ASCII value of char under the cursor (like "ga")
--- ```
---   :set statusline=%<%f%h%m%r%=%b\ 0x%B\ \ %l,%c%V\ %P
--- ```
--- Display byte count and byte value, modified flag in red.
--- ```
---   :set statusline=%<%f%=\ [%1*%M%*%n%R%H]\ %-19(%3l,%02c%03V%)%O'%02b'
---   :hi User1 term=inverse,bold cterm=inverse,bold ctermfg=red
--- ```
--- Display a ,GZ flag if a compressed file is loaded

--- Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see
--- the `:retab` command, and the 'softtabstop' option.
---
--- Note: Setting 'tabstop' to any other value than 8 can make your file
--- appear wrong in many places.
--- The value must be more than 0 and less than 10000.
---
--- There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:
--- 1. Always keep 'tabstop' at 8, set 'softtabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to 4
---    (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use 'noexpandtab'.  Then Vim
---    will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
---    behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
---    This is the recommended way, the file will look the same with other
---    tools and when listing it in a terminal.
--- 2. Set 'softtabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use
---    'expandtab'.  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
---    formatting will never be messed up when 'tabstop' is changed (leave
---    it at 8 just in case).  The file will be a bit larger.
---    You do need to check if no Tabs exist in the file.  You can get rid
---    of them by first setting 'expandtab' and using `%retab!`, making
---    sure the value of 'tabstop' is set correctly.
--- 3. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use
---    'expandtab'.  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
---    formatting will never be messed up when 'tabstop' is changed.
---    You do need to check if no Tabs exist in the file, just like in the
---    item just above.
--- 4. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use a
---    `modeline` to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
---    works when using Vim to edit the file, other tools assume a tabstop
---    is worth 8 spaces.
--- 5. Always set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to the same value, and
---    'noexpandtab'.  This should then work (for initial indents only)
---    for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
---    tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
---    though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when 'tabstop' is
---    changed.
---
--- The value of 'tabstop' will be ignored if `'vartabstop'` is set to
--- anything other than an empty string.

--- When searching for a tag (e.g., for the `:ta` command), Vim can either
--- use a binary search or a linear search in a tags file.  Binary
--- searching makes searching for a tag a LOT faster, but a linear search
--- will find more tags if the tags file wasn't properly sorted.
--- Vim normally assumes that your tags files are sorted, or indicate that
--- they are not sorted.  Only when this is not the case does the
--- 'tagbsearch' option need to be switched off.
---
--- When 'tagbsearch' is on, binary searching is first used in the tags
--- files.  In certain situations, Vim will do a linear search instead for
--- certain files, or retry all files with a linear search.  When
--- 'tagbsearch' is off, only a linear search is done.
---
--- Linear searching is done anyway, for one file, when Vim finds a line
--- at the start of the file indicating that it's not sorted:
--- ```
---    !_TAG_FILE_SORTED	0	/some comment/
--- ```
--- [The whitespace before and after the '0' must be a single <Tab>]
---
--- When a binary search was done and no match was found in any of the
--- files listed in 'tags', and case is ignored or a pattern is used
--- instead of a normal tag name, a retry is done with a linear search.
--- Tags in unsorted tags files, and matches with different case will only
--- be found in the retry.
---
--- If a tag file indicates that it is case-fold sorted, the second,
--- linear search can be avoided when case is ignored.  Use a value of '2'
--- in the "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED" line for this.  A tag file can be case-fold
--- sorted with the -f switch to "sort" in most unices, as in the command:
--- "sort -f -o tags tags".  For Universal ctags and Exuberant ctags
--- version 5.x or higher (at least 5.5) the --sort=foldcase switch can be
--- used for this as well.  Note that case must be folded to uppercase for
--- this to work.
---
--- By default, tag searches are case-sensitive.  Case is ignored when
--- 'ignorecase' is set and 'tagcase' is "followic", or when 'tagcase' is
--- "ignore".
--- Also when 'tagcase' is "followscs" and 'smartcase' is set, or
--- 'tagcase' is "smart", and the pattern contains only lowercase
--- characters.
---
--- When 'tagbsearch' is off, tags searching is slower when a full match
--- exists, but faster when no full match exists.  Tags in unsorted tags
--- files may only be found with 'tagbsearch' off.
--- When the tags file is not sorted, or sorted in a wrong way (not on
--- ASCII byte value), 'tagbsearch' should be off, or the line given above
--- must be included in the tags file.
--- This option doesn't affect commands that find all matching tags (e.g.,

--- "longest"	Complete till longest common string.  If this doesn't
--- 		result in a longer string, use the next part.
--- "list"		When more than one match, list all matches.
--- "lastused"	When completing buffer names and more than one buffer
--- 		matches, sort buffers by time last used (other than
--- 		the current buffer).
--- When there is only a single match, it is fully completed in all cases.
---
--- Examples of useful colon-separated values:
--- "longest:full"	Like "longest", but also start 'wildmenu' if it is
--- 		enabled.  Will not complete to the next full match.
--- "list:full"	When more than one match, list all matches and
--- 		complete first match.
--- "list:longest"	When more than one match, list all matches and

--- 		This will find more matches than the wildcard

--- 		is not supported for file and directory names and

--- 		in the same style as the `ins-completion-menu`.
---   tagfile	When using CTRL-D to list matching tags, the kind of

--- and only part of long lines will be displayed.  When the cursor is
--- moved to a part that is not shown, the screen will scroll
--- horizontally.
--- The line will be broken in the middle of a word if necessary.  See
--- 'linebreak' to get the break at a word boundary.
--- To make scrolling horizontally a bit more useful, try this:
--- ```
--- 	:set sidescroll=5
--- 	:set listchars+=precedes:<,extends:>
--- ```
--- See 'sidescroll', 'listchars' and `wrap-off`.

--- Make a backup before overwriting a file.  The backup is removed after
--- the file was successfully written, unless the 'backup' option is
--- also on.
--- WARNING: Switching this option off means that when Vim fails to write
--- your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
--- lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only reset
--- this option if your file system is almost full and it makes the write
--- fail (and make sure not to exit Vim until the write was successful).
--- See `backup-table` for another explanation.
--- When the 'backupskip' pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
--- Depending on 'backupcopy' the backup is a new file or the original
--- file renamed (and a new file is written).
