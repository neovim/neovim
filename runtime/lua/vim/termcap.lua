--- Query the host terminal emulator for terminfo capabilities.
---
--- This function sends the XTGETTCAP DCS sequence to the host terminal emulator asking the terminal
--- to send us its terminal capabilities. These are strings that are normally taken from a terminfo
--- file, however an up to date terminfo database is not always available (particularly on remote
--- machines), and many terminals continue to misidentify themselves or do not provide their own
--- terminfo file, making the terminfo database unreliable.
---
--- Querying the terminal guarantees that we get a truthful answer, but only if the host terminal
--- emulator supports the XTGETTCAP sequence.
---
--- @param caps string|table A terminal capability or list of capabilities to query
--- @param cb fun(cap:string, found:bool, seq:string?) Callback function which is called for
---           each capability in {caps}. {found} is set to true if the capability was found or false
---           otherwise. {seq} is the control sequence for the capability if found, or nil for
---           boolean capabilities.
