--- # LibUV in Lua
---
--- The [luv][] project provides access to the multi-platform support library
--- [libuv][] in Lua code. It was primarily developed for the [luvit][] project as
--- the built-in `uv` module, but can be used in other Lua environments.
---
--- More information about the core libuv library can be found at the original
--- [libuv documentation page][].


--- # TCP Echo Server Example
---
--- Here is a small example showing a TCP echo server:
---
--- ```lua
--- local uv = require("luv") -- "luv" when stand-alone, "uv" in luvi apps
---
--- local server = uv.new_tcp()
--- server:bind("127.0.0.1", 1337)
--- server:listen(128, function (err)
---   assert(not err, err)
---   local client = uv.new_tcp()
---   server:accept(client)
---   client:read_start(function (err, chunk)
---     assert(not err, err)
---     if chunk then
---       client:write(chunk)
---     else
---       client:shutdown()
---       client:close()
---     end
---   end)
--- end)
--- print("TCP server listening at 127.0.0.1 port 1337")
--- uv.run() -- an explicit run call is necessary outside of luvit
--- ```

--- # Module Layout
---
--- The luv library contains a single Lua module referred to hereafter as `uv` for
--- simplicity. This module consists mostly of functions with names corresponding to
--- their original libuv versions. For example, the libuv function `uv_tcp_bind` has
--- a luv version at `uv.tcp_bind`. Currently, only two non-function fields exists:
--- `uv.constants` and `uv.errno`, which are tables.

--- # Functions vs Methods
---
--- In addition to having simple functions, luv provides an optional method-style
--- API. For example, `uv.tcp_bind(server, host, port)` can alternatively be called
--- as `server:bind(host, port)`. Note that the first argument `server` becomes the
--- object and `tcp_` is removed from the function name. Method forms are
--- documented below where they exist.

--- # Synchronous vs Asynchronous Functions
---
--- Functions that accept a callback are asynchronous. These functions may
--- immediately return results to the caller to indicate their initial status, but
--- their final execution is deferred until at least the next libuv loop iteration.
--- After completion, their callbacks are executed with any results passed to it.
---
--- Functions that do not accept a callback are synchronous. These functions
--- immediately return their results to the caller.
---
--- Some (generally FS and DNS) functions can behave either synchronously or
--- asynchronously. If a callback is provided to these functions, they behave
--- asynchronously; if no callback is provided, they behave synchronously.

--- # Pseudo-Types
---
--- Some unique types are defined. These are not actual types in Lua, but they are
--- used here to facilitate documenting consistent behavior:
--- - `fail`: an assertable `nil, string, string` tuple (see [Error Handling][])
--- - `callable`: a `function`; or a `table` or `userdata` with a `__call`
---   metamethod
--- - `buffer`: a `string` or a sequential `table` of `string`s
--- - `threadargs`: variable arguments (`...`) of type `nil`, `boolean`, `number`,
---   `string`, or `userdata`, numbers of argument limited to 9.


--- # Contents
---
--- This documentation is mostly a retelling of the [libuv API documentation][]
--- within the context of luv's Lua API. Low-level implementation details and
--- unexposed C functions and types are not documented here except for when they
--- are relevant to behavior seen in the Lua module.

--- # Constants
---
--- As a Lua library, luv supports and encourages the use of lowercase strings to
--- represent options. For example:
--- ```lua
--- -- signal start with string input
--- uv.signal_start("sigterm", function(signame)
---   print(signame) -- string output: "sigterm"
--- end)
--- ```
---
--- However, luv also superficially exposes libuv constants in a Lua table at
--- `uv.constants` where its keys are uppercase constant names and their associated
--- values are integers defined internally by libuv. The values from this table may
--- be supported as function arguments, but their use may not change the output
--- type. For example:
---
--- ```lua
--- -- signal start with integer input
--- uv.signal_start(uv.constants.SIGTERM, function(signame)
---   print(signame) -- string output: "sigterm"
--- end)
--- ```
---
--- The uppercase constants defined in `uv.constants` that have associated
--- lowercase option strings are listed below.

--- # Error Handling
---
--- In libuv, errors are represented by negative numbered constants. While these
--- constants are made available in the `uv.errno` table, they are not returned by
--- luv functions and the libuv functions used to handle them are not exposed.
--- Instead, if an internal error is encountered, the failing luv function will
--- return to the caller an assertable `nil, err, name` tuple:
---
--- - `nil` idiomatically indicates failure
--- - `err` is a string with the format `{name}: {message}`
---   - `{name}` is the error name provided internally by `uv_err_name`
---   - `{message}` is a human-readable message provided internally by `uv_strerror`
--- - `name` is the same string used to construct `err`
---
--- This tuple is referred to below as the `fail` pseudo-type.
---
--- When a function is called successfully, it will return either a value that is
--- relevant to the operation of the function, or the integer `0` to indicate
--- success, or sometimes nothing at all. These cases are documented below.
---
--- Below is a list of known error names and error strings. See libuv's
--- [error constants][] page for an original source.

--- # Version Checking

--- Returns the libuv version packed into a single integer. 8 bits are used for each
--- component, with the patch number stored in the 8 least significant bits. For
--- example, this would be 0x010203 in libuv 1.2.3.
--- @return integer
function uv.version() end

--- Returns the libuv version number as a string. For example, this would be "1.2.3"
--- in libuv 1.2.3. For non-release versions, the version suffix is included.
--- @return string
function uv.version_string() end


--- # `uv_loop_t` - Event loop
---
--- The event loop is the central part of libuv's functionality. It takes care of
--- polling for I/O and scheduling callbacks to be run based on different sources of
--- events.
---
--- In luv, there is an implicit uv loop for every Lua state that loads the library.
--- You can use this library in an multi-threaded environment as long as each thread
--- has it's own Lua state with its corresponding own uv loop. This loop is not
--- directly exposed to users in the Lua module.

--- Closes all internal loop resources. In normal execution, the loop will
--- automatically be closed when it is garbage collected by Lua, so it is not
--- necessary to explicitly call `loop_close()`. Call this function only after the
--- loop has finished executing and all open handles and requests have been closed,
--- or it will return `EBUSY`.
--- @return 0? success
--- @return string? err
--- @return uv.error_name? err_name
function uv.loop_close() end

--- This function runs the event loop. It will act differently depending on the
--- specified mode:
---
---   - `"default"`: Runs the event loop until there are no more active and
---   referenced handles or requests. Returns `true` if `uv.stop()` was called and
---   there are still active handles or requests. Returns `false` in all other
---   cases.
---
---   - `"once"`: Poll for I/O once. Note that this function blocks if there are no
---   pending callbacks. Returns `false` when done (no active handles or requests
---   left), or `true` if more callbacks are expected (meaning you should run the
---   event loop again sometime in the future).
---
---   - `"nowait"`: Poll for I/O once but don't block if there are no pending
---   callbacks. Returns `false` if done (no active handles or requests left),
---   or `true` if more callbacks are expected (meaning you should run the event
---   loop again sometime in the future).
--- **Note**:
--- Luvit will implicitly call `uv.run()` after loading user code, but if
--- you use the luv bindings directly, you need to call this after registering
--- your initial set of event callbacks to start the event loop.
--- @param mode string?
--- @return boolean? running
--- @return string? err
--- @return uv.error_name? err_name
function uv.run(mode) end

--- Set additional loop options. You should normally call this before the first call
--- to uv_run() unless mentioned otherwise.
---
--- Supported options:
---
---   - `"block_signal"`: Block a signal when polling for new events. The second argument
---   to loop_configure() is the signal name (as a lowercase string) or the signal number.
---   This operation is currently only implemented for `"sigprof"` signals, to suppress
---   unnecessary wakeups when using a sampling profiler. Requesting other signals will
---   fail with `EINVAL`.
---   - `"metrics_idle_time"`: Accumulate the amount of idle time the event loop spends
---   in the event provider. This option is necessary to use `metrics_idle_time()`.
---
--- An example of a valid call to this function is:
---
--- ```lua
--- uv.loop_configure("block_signal", "sigprof")
--- ```
--- **Note**:
--- Be prepared to handle the `ENOSYS` error; it means the loop option is
--- not supported by the platform.
--- @param option string
--- @param ... any depends on `option`
--- @return 0? success
--- @return string? err
--- @return uv.error_name? err_name
function uv.loop_configure(option, ...) end

--- If the loop is running, returns a string indicating the mode in use. If the loop
--- is not running, `nil` is returned instead.
--- @return string?
function uv.loop_mode() end

--- Returns `true` if there are referenced active handles, active requests, or
--- closing handles in the loop; otherwise, `false`.
--- @return boolean? alive
--- @return string? err
--- @return uv.error_name? err_name
function uv.loop_alive() end

--- Stop the event loop, causing `uv.run()` to end as soon as possible. This
--- will happen not sooner than the next loop iteration. If this function was called
--- before blocking for I/O, the loop won't block for I/O on this iteration.
function uv.stop() end

--- Get backend file descriptor. Only kqueue, epoll, and event ports are supported.
---
--- This can be used in conjunction with `uv.run("nowait")` to poll in one thread
--- and run the event loop's callbacks in another
--- **Note**:
--- Embedding a kqueue fd in another kqueue pollset doesn't work on all
--- platforms. It's not an error to add the fd but it never generates events.
--- @return integer?
function uv.backend_fd() end

--- Get the poll timeout. The return value is in milliseconds, or -1 for no timeout.
--- @return integer
function uv.backend_timeout() end

--- Returns the current timestamp in milliseconds. The timestamp is cached at the
--- start of the event loop tick, see `uv.update_time()` for details and rationale.
---
--- The timestamp increases monotonically from some arbitrary point in time. Don't
--- make assumptions about the starting point, you will only get disappointed.
--- **Note**:
--- Use `uv.hrtime()` if you need sub-millisecond granularity.
--- @return integer
function uv.now() end

--- Update the event loop's concept of "now". Libuv caches the current time at the
--- start of the event loop tick in order to reduce the number of time-related
--- system calls.
---
--- You won't normally need to call this function unless you have callbacks that
--- block the event loop for longer periods of time, where "longer" is somewhat
--- subjective but probably on the order of a millisecond or more.
function uv.update_time() end

--- Walk the list of handles: `callback` will be executed with each handle.
--- Example
--- ```lua
--- -- Example usage of uv.walk to close all handles that aren't already closing.
--- uv.walk(function (handle)
---   if not handle:is_closing() then
---     handle:close()
---   end
--- end)
--- ```
--- @param callback fun(handle: uv.uv_handle_t)
function uv.walk(callback) end

--- @class uv.uv_req_t : userdata
local uv_req_t = {}

--- @return 0? success
--- @return string? err
--- @return uv.error_name? err_name
function uv_req_t:cancel() end

--- Returns the name of the struct for a given request (e.g. `"fs"` for `uv_fs_t`)
--- and the libuv enum integer for the request's type (`uv_req_type`).
--- @param req uv.uv_req_t
--- @return string type
--- @return integer enum
function uv.req_get_type(req) end

--- defined here work with any handle type.
--- @class uv.uv_handle_t : userdata
local uv_handle_t = {}

--- Returns `true` if the handle is active, `false` if it's inactive. What "active”
--- means depends on the type of handle:

--- # `uv_poll_t` - Poll handle
---
--- > [`uv_handle_t`][] functions also apply.
---
--- Poll handles are used to watch file descriptors for readability and writability,
--- similar to the purpose of [poll(2)](http://linux.die.net/man/2/poll).
---
--- The purpose of poll handles is to enable integrating external libraries that
--- rely on the event loop to signal it about the socket status changes, like c-ares
--- or libssh2. Using `uv_poll_t` for any other purpose is not recommended;
--- `uv_tcp_t`, `uv_udp_t`, etc. provide an implementation that is faster and more
--- scalable than what can be achieved with `uv_poll_t`, especially on Windows.
---
--- It is possible that poll handles occasionally signal that a file descriptor is
--- readable or writable even when it isn't. The user should therefore always be
--- prepared to handle EAGAIN or equivalent when it attempts to read from or write
--- to the fd.
---
--- It is not okay to have multiple active poll handles for the same socket, this
--- can cause libuv to busyloop or otherwise malfunction.
---
--- The user should not close a file descriptor while it is being polled by an
--- active poll handle. This can cause the handle to report an error, but it might
--- also start polling another socket. However the fd can be safely closed
--- immediately after a call to `uv.poll_stop()` or `uv.close()`.
---
--- **Note**: On windows only sockets can be polled with poll handles. On Unix any
--- file descriptor that would be accepted by poll(2) can be used.
--- @class uv.uv_poll_t : uv.uv_handle_t
local uv_poll_t = {}

--- # `uv_signal_t` - Signal handle
---
--- > [`uv_handle_t`][] functions also apply.
---
--- Signal handles implement Unix style signal handling on a per-event loop bases.
---
--- **Windows Notes:**
---
--- Reception of some signals is emulated on Windows:
---   - SIGINT is normally delivered when the user presses CTRL+C. However, like on
---   Unix, it is not generated when terminal raw mode is enabled.
---   - SIGBREAK is delivered when the user pressed CTRL + BREAK.
---   - SIGHUP is generated when the user closes the console window. On SIGHUP the
---   program is given approximately 10 seconds to perform cleanup. After that
---   Windows will unconditionally terminate it.
---   - SIGWINCH is raised whenever libuv detects that the console has been resized.
---   SIGWINCH is emulated by libuv when the program uses a uv_tty_t handle to write
---   to the console. SIGWINCH may not always be delivered in a timely manner; libuv
---   will only detect size changes when the cursor is being moved. When a readable
---   [`uv_tty_t`][] handle is used in raw mode, resizing the console buffer will
---   also trigger a SIGWINCH signal.
---   - Watchers for other signals can be successfully created, but these signals
---   are never received. These signals are: SIGILL, SIGABRT, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV,
---   SIGTERM and SIGKILL.
---   - Calls to raise() or abort() to programmatically raise a signal are not
---   detected by libuv; these will not trigger a signal watcher.
---
--- **Unix Notes:**
---
---   - SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are impossible to catch.
---   - Handling SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL or SIGSEGV via libuv results into undefined
---   behavior.
---   - SIGABRT will not be caught by libuv if generated by abort(), e.g. through
---   assert().
---   - On Linux SIGRT0 and SIGRT1 (signals 32 and 33) are used by the NPTL pthreads
---   library to manage threads. Installing watchers for those signals will lead to
---   unpredictable behavior and is strongly discouraged. Future versions of libuv
---   may simply reject them.

--- # File system operations
---
--- Most file system functions can operate synchronously or asynchronously. When a synchronous version is called (by omitting a callback), the function will
--- immediately return the results of the FS call. When an asynchronous version is
--- called (by providing a callback), the function will immediately return a
--- `uv_fs_t userdata` and asynchronously execute its callback; if an error is encountered, the first and only argument passed to the callback will be the `err` error string; if the operation completes successfully, the first argument will be `nil` and the remaining arguments will be the results of the FS call.
---
--- Synchronous and asynchronous versions of `readFile` (with naive error handling)
--- are implemented below as an example:
---
--- ```lua
--- local function readFileSync(path)
---   local fd = assert(uv.fs_open(path, "r", 438))
---   local stat = assert(uv.fs_fstat(fd))
---   local data = assert(uv.fs_read(fd, stat.size, 0))
---   assert(uv.fs_close(fd))
---   return data
--- end
---
--- local data = readFileSync("main.lua")
--- print("synchronous read", data)
--- ```
---
--- ```lua
--- local function readFile(path, callback)
---   uv.fs_open(path, "r", 438, function(err, fd)
---     assert(not err, err)
---     uv.fs_fstat(fd, function(err, stat)
---       assert(not err, err)
---       uv.fs_read(fd, stat.size, 0, function(err, data)
---         assert(not err, err)
---         uv.fs_close(fd, function(err)
---           assert(not err, err)
---           return callback(data)
---         end)
---       end)
---     end)
---   end)
--- end
---

---   print("asynchronous read", data)
--- end)
--- ```

--- # Thread pool work scheduling

--- # Metrics operations

--- Retrieve the amount of time the event loop has been idle in the kernel’s event
--- provider (e.g. `epoll_wait`). The call is thread safe.
---
--- The return value is the accumulated time spent idle in the kernel’s event
--- provider starting from when the [`uv_loop_t`][] was configured to collect the idle time.
---
--- **Note:** The event loop will not begin accumulating the event provider’s idle
--- time until calling `loop_configure` with `"metrics_idle_time"`.
--- @return number

--- @class uv.metrics_info.info
--- @field loop_count number
--- @field events integer
--- @field events_waiting number

--- Get the metrics table from current set of event loop metrics. It is recommended
--- to retrieve these metrics in a `prepare` callback (see `uv.new_prepare`,
--- `uv.prepare_start`) in order to make sure there are no inconsistencies with the
--- metrics counters.

--- # String manipulation functions
---
--- These string utilities are needed internally for dealing with Windows, and are exported to allow clients to work uniformly with this data when the libuv API is not complete.
---
--- **Notes**:
---
--- 1. New in luv version 1.49.0.
--- 2. See [the WTF-8 spec](https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/) for information about WTF-8.
--- 3. Luv uses Lua-style strings, which means that all inputs and return values (UTF-8 or UTF-16 strings) do not include a NUL terminator.

--- Get the length (in bytes) of a UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string `utf16` value after converting it to WTF-8.
--- @param utf16 string
--- @return integer
function uv.utf16_length_as_wtf8(utf16) end

--- Convert UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string `utf16` to WTF-8 string. The endianness of the UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string is assumed to be the same as the native endianness of the platform.
--- @param utf16 string
--- @return string
function uv.utf16_to_wtf8(utf16) end

--- Get the length (in UTF-16 code units) of a WTF-8 `wtf8` value after converting it to UTF-16 (or UCS-2). Note: The number of bytes needed for a UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string is `<number of code units> * 2`.
--- @param wtf8 string
--- @return integer
function uv.wtf8_length_as_utf16(wtf8) end

--- Convert WTF-8 string in `wtf8` to UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string. The endianness of the UTF-16 (or UCS-2) string will be the same as the native endianness of the platform.
--- @param wtf8 string
--- @return string
function uv.wtf8_to_utf16(wtf8) end
