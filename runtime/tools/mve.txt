My compiler (SGI MIPSpro C compiler - IRIX 6.4) works like this.
I have written a script mve (make vim errors), through which I pipe my make
output, which translates output of the following form:

cfe: Error: syntax.c, line 4: Syntax Error
     int i[12;
 ------------^

into:

 cl.c, line 4, col 12 :  Syntax Error

(in vim notation:  %f, line %l, col %c : %m)

You might be able to tailor this for your compiler's output.
