// Job is a short name we use to refer to child processes that run in parallel
// with the editor, probably executing long-running tasks and sending updates
// asynchronously. Communication happens through anonymous pipes connected to
// the job's std{in,out,err}. They are more like bash/zsh co-processes than the
// usual shell background job. The name 'Job' was chosen because it applies to
// the concept while being significantly shorter.
