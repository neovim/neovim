// iconv can be linked at compile-time as well as loaded at runtime. In the
// latter case, some function pointers need to be initialized after loading
// the library (see `iconv_enabled()` in mbyte.c). These function pointers
// are stored in globals.h. Since globals.h includes iconv.h to get the
// definition of USE_ICONV, we can't include it from iconv.h. One way to
// solve this conundrum would be perhaps to let cmake decide the value of
// USE_ICONV, or to put the USE_ICONV definition in config.h.in directly. As
// it stands, globals.h needs to be included alongside iconv.h.
