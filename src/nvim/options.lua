        Tells Vim what to do with characters with East Asian Width Class
        Ambiguous (such as Euro, Registered Sign, Copyright Sign, Greek
        letters, Cyrillic letters).

        There are currently two possible values:
        "single":	Use the same width as characters in US-ASCII.  This is
        		expected by most users.
        "double":	Use twice the width of ASCII characters.
        						*E834* *E835*
        The value "double" cannot be used if 'listchars' or 'fillchars'
        contains a character that would be double width.  These errors may
        also be given when calling setcellwidths().

        The values are overruled for characters specified with
        |setcellwidths()|.

        There are a number of CJK fonts for which the width of glyphs for
        those characters are solely based on how many octets they take in
        legacy/traditional CJK encodings.  In those encodings, Euro,
        Registered sign, Greek/Cyrillic letters are represented by two octets,
        therefore those fonts have "wide" glyphs for them.  This is also
        true of some line drawing characters used to make tables in text
        file.  Therefore, when a CJK font is used for GUI Vim or
        Vim is running inside a terminal (emulators) that uses a CJK font
        (or Vim is run inside an xterm invoked with "-cjkwidth" option.),
        this option should be set to "double" to match the width perceived
        by Vim with the width of glyphs in the font.  Perhaps it also has
        to be set to "double" under CJK MS-Windows when the system locale is
        set to one of CJK locales.  See Unicode Standard Annex #11

        When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
        done.  This is a comma-separated list of words.

        The main values are:
        "yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
        "no"	rename the file and write a new one
        "auto"	one of the previous, what works best

        Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
        "breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
        "breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing

        Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
        - Takes extra time to copy the file.
        + When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
          has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
        - When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
          not of the real file.

        Renaming the file and writing a new one:
        + It's fast.
        - Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
          file.
        - When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.

        The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming the
        file is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on
        and the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected,
        a copy will be made.

        The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
        combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
        force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
        exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
        become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
        useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
        hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
        be propagated back to the original source.
        						*crontab*
        One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
        that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
        the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
        backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
        example.

        When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
        with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
        symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file,
        however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
        group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
        fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
        others.

        When the file is renamed, this is the other way around: The backup has
        the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
        is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
        link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
        rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
        written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
        the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
        again not rename the file.

        List of directories for the backup file, separated with commas.
        - The backup file will be created in the first directory in the list
          where this is possible.  If none of the directories exist Nvim will
          attempt to create the last directory in the list.
        - Empty means that no backup file will be created ('patchmode' is
          impossible!).  Writing may fail because of this.
        - A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
          as the edited file.
        - A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
          the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
          "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
          ("." inside a directory name has no special meaning).
        - Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
          of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
          name, precede it with a backslash.
        - To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
        - A directory name may end in an '/'.
        - For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
          the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
          with all path separators changed to percent '%' signs. This will
          ensure file name uniqueness in the backup directory.
          On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
          separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
          include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
          use '//', instead of '\\'.
        - Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
        - Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
          get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
            :set bdir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
        <
        See also 'backup' and 'writebackup' options.
        If you want to hide your backup files on Unix, consider this value: >

        NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the 'bin' option is

        'textwidth'), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
        'bin' again when the file has been loaded.
        The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when

        When writing a file and the following conditions are met, a BOM (Byte
        Order Mark) is prepended to the file:
        - this option is on

        - 'fileencoding' is "utf-8", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" or one of the little/big
          endian variants.
        Some applications use the BOM to recognize the encoding of the file.
        Often used for UCS-2 files on MS-Windows.  For other applications it
        causes trouble, for example: "cat file1 file2" makes the BOM of file2
        appear halfway through the resulting file.  Gcc doesn't accept a BOM.
        When Vim reads a file and 'fileencodings' starts with "ucs-bom", a
        check for the presence of the BOM is done and 'bomb' set accordingly.
        Unless 'binary' is set, it is removed from the first line, so that you
        don't see it when editing.  When you don't change the options, the BOM
        will be restored when writing the file.

        Also see |win_gettype()|, which returns the type of the window.

        Be careful with changing this option, it can have many side effects!
        One such effect is that Vim will not check the timestamp of the file,
        if the file is changed by another program this will not be noticed.

        A "quickfix" buffer is only used for the error list and the location
        list.  This value is set by the |:cwindow| and |:lwindow| commands and
        you are not supposed to change it.

        "nofile" and "nowrite" buffers are similar:
        both:		The buffer is not to be written to disk, ":w" doesn't
        		work (":w filename" does work though).
        both:		The buffer is never considered to be |'modified'|.
        		There is no warning when the changes will be lost, for
        		example when you quit Vim.
        both:		A swap file is only created when using too much memory
        		(when 'swapfile' has been reset there is never a swap
        		file).
        nofile only:	The buffer name is fixed, it is not handled like a
        		file name.  It is not modified in response to a |:cd|
        		command.
        both:		When using ":e bufname" and already editing "bufname"
        		the buffer is made empty and autocommands are
        		triggered as usual for |:edit|.
        						*E676*
        "acwrite" implies that the buffer name is not related to a file, like
        "nofile", but it will be written.  Thus, in contrast to "nofile" and
        "nowrite", ":w" does work and a modified buffer can't be abandoned
        without saving.  For writing there must be matching |BufWriteCmd|,
        |FileWriteCmd| or |FileAppendCmd| autocommands.

        'charconvert' is not used when the internal iconv() function is
        supported and is able to do the conversion.  Using iconv() is
        preferred, because it is much faster.
        'charconvert' is not used when reading stdin |--|, because there is no
        file to convert from.  You will have to save the text in a file first.
        The expression must return zero, false or an empty string for success,
        non-zero or true for failure.
        See |encoding-names| for possible encoding names.
        Additionally, names given in 'fileencodings' and 'fileencoding' are

           menuone  Use the popup menu also when there is only one match.
        	    Useful when there is additional information about the
        	    match, e.g., what file it comes from.

           longest  Only insert the longest common text of the matches.  If
        	    the menu is displayed you can use CTRL-L to add more
        	    characters.  Whether case is ignored depends on the kind
        	    of completion.  For buffer text the 'ignorecase' option is
        	    used.

           preview  Show extra information about the currently selected
        	    completion in the preview window.  Only works in
        	    combination with "menu" or "menuone".

          noinsert  Do not insert any text for a match until the user selects
        	    a match from the menu. Only works in combination with
        	    "menu" or "menuone". No effect if "longest" is present.

          noselect  Do not select a match in the menu, force the user to
        	    select one from the menu. Only works in combination with
        	    "menu" or "menuone".

          useful when editing a batch file with 'shellslash' set on MS-Windows.

        A sequence of single character flags.  When a character is present

        not being Vi-compatible is mostly or sometimes preferred.
        'cpoptions' stands for "compatible-options".
        Commas can be added for readability.
        To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
        "+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.

            contains	behavior	~
        							*cpo-a*
        	a	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
        		argument will set the alternate file name for the
        		current window.
        							*cpo-A*
        	A	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
        		argument will set the alternate file name for the
        		current window.
        							*cpo-b*
        	b	"\|" in a ":map" command is recognized as the end of
        		the map command.  The '\' is included in the mapping,
        		the text after the '|' is interpreted as the next
        		command.  Use a CTRL-V instead of a backslash to
        		include the '|' in the mapping.  Applies to all
        		mapping, abbreviation, menu and autocmd commands.
        		See also |map_bar|.
        							*cpo-B*
        	B	A backslash has no special meaning in mappings,
        		abbreviations, user commands and the "to" part of the
        		menu commands.  Remove this flag to be able to use a
        		backslash like a CTRL-V.  For example, the command
        		":map X \\<Esc>" results in X being mapped to:
        			'B' included:	"\^["	 (^[ is a real <Esc>)
        			'B' excluded:	"<Esc>"  (5 characters)
        							*cpo-c*
        	c	Searching continues at the end of any match at the
        		cursor position, but not further than the start of the
        		next line.  When not present searching continues
        		one character from the cursor position.  With 'c'
        		"abababababab" only gets three matches when repeating
        		"/abab", without 'c' there are five matches.
        							*cpo-C*
        	C	Do not concatenate sourced lines that start with a
        		backslash.  See |line-continuation|.
        							*cpo-d*
        	d	Using "./" in the 'tags' option doesn't mean to use
        		the tags file relative to the current file, but the
        		tags file in the current directory.
        							*cpo-D*
        	D	Can't use CTRL-K to enter a digraph after Normal mode
        		commands with a character argument, like |r|, |f| and
        		|t|.
        							*cpo-e*
        	e	When executing a register with ":@r", always add a
        		<CR> to the last line, also when the register is not
        		linewise.  If this flag is not present, the register
        		is not linewise and the last line does not end in a
        		<CR>, then the last line is put on the command-line
        		and can be edited before hitting <CR>.
        							*cpo-E*
        	E	It is an error when using "y", "d", "c", "g~", "gu" or
        		"gU" on an Empty region.  The operators only work when
        		at least one character is to be operated on.  Example:
        		This makes "y0" fail in the first column.
        							*cpo-f*
        	f	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
        		argument will set the file name for the current buffer,
        		if the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet.
        							*cpo-F*
        	F	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
        		argument will set the file name for the current
        		buffer, if the current buffer doesn't have a file name
        		yet.  Also see |cpo-P|.
        							*cpo-i*
        	i	When included, interrupting the reading of a file will
        		leave it modified.
        							*cpo-I*
        	I	When moving the cursor up or down just after inserting
        		indent for 'autoindent', do not delete the indent.
        							*cpo-J*
        	J	A |sentence| has to be followed by two spaces after
        		the '.', '!' or '?'.  A <Tab> is not recognized as
        		white space.
        							*cpo-K*
        	K	Don't wait for a key code to complete when it is
        		halfway through a mapping.  This breaks mapping
        		<F1><F1> when only part of the second <F1> has been
        		read.  It enables cancelling the mapping by typing
        		<F1><Esc>.
        							*cpo-l*
        	l	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
        		literally, only "\]", "\^", "\-" and "\\" are special.
        		See |/[]|
        		   'l' included: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space>, '\' and 't'
        		   'l' excluded: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space> and <Tab>
        							*cpo-L*
        	L	When the 'list' option is set, 'wrapmargin',
        		'textwidth', 'softtabstop' and Virtual Replace mode
        		(see |gR|) count a <Tab> as two characters, instead of
        		the normal behavior of a <Tab>.
        							*cpo-m*
        	m	When included, a showmatch will always wait half a
        		second.  When not included, a showmatch will wait half
        		a second or until a character is typed.  |'showmatch'|
        							*cpo-M*
        	M	When excluded, "%" matching will take backslashes into
        		account.  Thus in "( \( )" and "\( ( \)" the outer
        		parenthesis match.  When included "%" ignores
        		backslashes, which is Vi compatible.
        							*cpo-n*
        	n	When included, the column used for 'number' and
        		'relativenumber' will also be used for text of wrapped
        		lines.
        							*cpo-o*
        	o	Line offset to search command is not remembered for
        		next search.
        							*cpo-O*
        	O	Don't complain if a file is being overwritten, even
        		when it didn't exist when editing it.  This is a
        		protection against a file unexpectedly created by
        		someone else.  Vi didn't complain about this.
        							*cpo-p*
        	p	Vi compatible Lisp indenting.  When not present, a
        		slightly better algorithm is used.
        							*cpo-P*
        	P	When included, a ":write" command that appends to a
        		file will set the file name for the current buffer, if
        		the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet and
        		the 'F' flag is also included |cpo-F|.
        							*cpo-q*
        	q	When joining multiple lines leave the cursor at the
        		position where it would be when joining two lines.
        							*cpo-r*
        	r	Redo ("." command) uses "/" to repeat a search
        		command, instead of the actually used search string.
        							*cpo-R*
        	R	Remove marks from filtered lines.  Without this flag
        		marks are kept like |:keepmarks| was used.
        							*cpo-s*
        	s	Set buffer options when entering the buffer for the
        		first time.  This is like it is in Vim version 3.0.
        		And it is the default.  If not present the options are
        		set when the buffer is created.
        							*cpo-S*
        	S	Set buffer options always when entering a buffer
        		(except 'readonly', 'fileformat', 'filetype' and
        		'syntax').  This is the (most) Vi compatible setting.
        		The options are set to the values in the current
        		buffer.  When you change an option and go to another
        		buffer, the value is copied.  Effectively makes the
        		buffer options global to all buffers.

        		's'    'S'     copy buffer options
        		no     no      when buffer created
        		yes    no      when buffer first entered (default)
        		 X     yes     each time when buffer entered (vi comp.)
        							*cpo-t*
        	t	Search pattern for the tag command is remembered for
        		"n" command.  Otherwise Vim only puts the pattern in
        		the history for search pattern, but doesn't change the
        		last used search pattern.
        							*cpo-u*
        	u	Undo is Vi compatible.  See |undo-two-ways|.
        							*cpo-v*
        	v	Backspaced characters remain visible on the screen in
        		Insert mode.  Without this flag the characters are
        		erased from the screen right away.  With this flag the
        		screen newly typed text overwrites backspaced
        		characters.
        							*cpo-W*
        	W	Don't overwrite a readonly file.  When omitted, ":w!"
        		overwrites a readonly file, if possible.
        							*cpo-x*
        	x	<Esc> on the command-line executes the command-line.
        		The default in Vim is to abandon the command-line,
        		because <Esc> normally aborts a command.  |c_<Esc>|
        							*cpo-X*
        	X	When using a count with "R" the replaced text is
        		deleted only once.  Also when repeating "R" with "."
        		and a count.
        							*cpo-y*
        	y	A yank command can be redone with ".".  Think twice if
        		you really want to use this, it may break some
        		plugins, since most people expect "." to only repeat a
        		change.
        							*cpo-Z*
        	Z	When using "w!" while the 'readonly' option is set,
        		don't reset 'readonly'.
        							*cpo-!*
        	!	When redoing a filter command, use the last used
        		external command, whatever it was.  Otherwise the last
        		used -filter- command is used.
        							*cpo-$*
        	$	When making a change to one line, don't redisplay the
        		line, but put a '$' at the end of the changed text.
        		The changed text will be overwritten when you type the
        		new text.  The line is redisplayed if you type any
        		command that moves the cursor from the insertion
        		point.
        							*cpo-%*
        	%	Vi-compatible matching is done for the "%" command.
        		Does not recognize "#if", "#endif", etc.
        		Does not recognize "/*" and "*/".
        		Parens inside single and double quotes are also
        		counted, causing a string that contains a paren to
        		disturb the matching.  For example, in a line like
        		"if (strcmp("foo(", s))" the first paren does not
        		match the last one.  When this flag is not included,
        		parens inside single and double quotes are treated
        		specially.  When matching a paren outside of quotes,
        		everything inside quotes is ignored.  When matching a
        		paren inside quotes, it will find the matching one (if
        		there is one).  This works very well for C programs.
        		This flag is also used for other features, such as
        		C-indenting.
        							*cpo-+*
        	+	When included, a ":write file" command will reset the
        		'modified' flag of the buffer, even though the buffer
        		itself may still be different from its file.
        							*cpo->*
        	>	When appending to a register, put a line break before
        		the appended text.
        							*cpo-;*
        	;	When using |,| or |;| to repeat the last |t| search
        		and the cursor is right in front of the searched
        		character, the cursor won't move. When not included,
        		the cursor would skip over it and jump to the
        		following occurrence.
        							*cpo-_*
        	_	When using |cw| on a word, do not include the
        		whitespace following the word in the motion.

        Where to find a list of words?

        Option settings for diff mode.  It can consist of the following items.
        All are optional.  Items must be separated by a comma.

        	filler		Show filler lines, to keep the text
        			synchronized with a window that has inserted
        			lines at the same position.  Mostly useful
        			when windows are side-by-side and 'scrollbind'
        			is set.

        	context:{n}	Use a context of {n} lines between a change
        			and a fold that contains unchanged lines.
        			When omitted a context of six lines is used.
        			When using zero the context is actually one,
        			since folds require a line in between, also
        			for a deleted line.
        			See |fold-diff|.

        	iblank		Ignore changes where lines are all blank.  Adds
        			the "-B" flag to the "diff" command if
        			'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
        			of the "diff" command for what this does
        			exactly.
        			NOTE: the diff windows will get out of sync,
        			because no differences between blank lines are
        			taken into account.

        	icase		Ignore changes in case of text.  "a" and "A"
        			are considered the same.  Adds the "-i" flag
        			to the "diff" command if 'diffexpr' is empty.

        	iwhite		Ignore changes in amount of white space.  Adds
        			the "-b" flag to the "diff" command if
        			'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
        			of the "diff" command for what this does
        			exactly.  It should ignore adding trailing
        			white space, but not leading white space.

        	iwhiteall	Ignore all white space changes.  Adds
        			the "-w" flag to the "diff" command if
        			'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
        			of the "diff" command for what this does
        			exactly.

        	iwhiteeol	Ignore white space changes at end of line.
        			Adds the "-Z" flag to the "diff" command if
        			'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
        			of the "diff" command for what this does
        			exactly.

        	horizontal	Start diff mode with horizontal splits (unless
        			explicitly specified otherwise).

        	vertical	Start diff mode with vertical splits (unless
        			explicitly specified otherwise).

        	closeoff	When a window is closed where 'diff' is set
        			and there is only one window remaining in the
        			same tab page with 'diff' set, execute
        			`:diffoff` in that window.  This undoes a
        			`:diffsplit` command.

        	hiddenoff	Do not use diff mode for a buffer when it
        			becomes hidden.

        	foldcolumn:{n}	Set the 'foldcolumn' option to {n} when
        			starting diff mode.  Without this 2 is used.

        	followwrap	Follow the 'wrap' option and leave as it is.

        	internal	Use the internal diff library.  This is
        			ignored when 'diffexpr' is set.  *E960*
        			When running out of memory when writing a
        			buffer this item will be ignored for diffs
        			involving that buffer.  Set the 'verbose'
        			option to see when this happens.

        	indent-heuristic
        			Use the indent heuristic for the internal
        			diff library.

        	linematch:{n}   Enable a second stage diff on each generated
        			hunk in order to align lines. When the total
        			number of lines in a hunk exceeds {n}, the
        			second stage diff will not be performed as
        			very large hunks can cause noticeable lag. A
        			recommended setting is "linematch:60", as this
        			will enable alignment for a 2 buffer diff with
        			hunks of up to 30 lines each, or a 3 buffer
        			diff with hunks of up to 20 lines each.

        	algorithm:{text} Use the specified diff algorithm with the
        			internal diff engine. Currently supported
        			algorithms are:
        			myers      the default algorithm
        			minimal    spend extra time to generate the
        				   smallest possible diff
        			patience   patience diff algorithm
        			histogram  histogram diff algorithm

        List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.

        Possible items:
        - The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is
          possible.  If it is not possible in any directory, but last
          directory listed in the option does not exist, it is created.
        - Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
          impossible!) and no |E303| error will be given.
        - A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
          the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
          it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
          attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
        - A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-Windows) means to put
          the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading "."
          is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
        - For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
          the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
          with all path separators replaced by percent '%' signs (including
          the colon following the drive letter on Win32). This will ensure
          file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
          On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
          separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
          include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
          use '//', instead of '\\'.
        - Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
          of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
          name, precede it with a backslash.
        - To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
        - A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
        - Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
        - Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
          get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
            :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
        <
        Editing the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on
        is discouraged: if the system crashes you lose the swap file. And
        others on the computer may be able to see the files.
        Use |:set+=| and |:set-=| when adding or removing directories from the
        list, this avoids problems if the Nvim default is changed.

        This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
        security reasons.

        When 'fileencoding' is not UTF-8, conversion will be done when
        writing the file.  For reading see below.
        When 'fileencoding' is empty, the file will be saved with UTF-8
        encoding (no conversion when reading or writing a file).

        WARNING: Conversion to a non-Unicode encoding can cause loss of
        information!

        See |encoding-names| for the possible values.  Additionally, values may be
        specified that can be handled by the converter, see
        |mbyte-conversion|.

        When reading a file 'fileencoding' will be set from 'fileencodings'.
        To read a file in a certain encoding it won't work by setting
        'fileencoding', use the |++enc| argument.  One exception: when
        'fileencodings' is empty the value of 'fileencoding' is used.
        For a new file the global value of 'fileencoding' is used.

        Prepending "8bit-" and "2byte-" has no meaning here, they are ignored.
        When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
        you can set it with uppercase values too.  '_' characters are
        replaced with '-'.  If a name is recognized from the list at
        |encoding-names|, it is replaced by the standard name.  For example
        "ISO8859-2" becomes "iso-8859-2".

        When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the 'modified'
        option is set, because the file would be different when written.

        Keep in mind that changing 'fenc' from a modeline happens
        AFTER the text has been read, thus it applies to when the file will be
        written.  If you do set 'fenc' in a modeline, you might want to set
        'nomodified' to avoid not being able to ":q".

        This option cannot be changed when 'modifiable' is off.

        This is a list of character encodings considered when starting to edit
        an existing file.  When a file is read, Vim tries to use the first
        mentioned character encoding.  If an error is detected, the next one
        in the list is tried.  When an encoding is found that works,
        'fileencoding' is set to it.  If all fail, 'fileencoding' is set to
        an empty string, which means that UTF-8 is used.
        	WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information! You can use
        	the |++bad| argument to specify what is done with characters
        	that can't be converted.
        For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
        will work and the first entry of 'fileencodings' will be used (except
        "ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
        another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
        preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
        	au BufReadPost * if search('\S', 'w') == 0 |
        		\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
        <	This sets 'fileencoding' to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
        non-blank characters.
        When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of 'fileencodings' is
        not used.
        Note that 'fileencodings' is not used for a new file, the global value
        of 'fileencoding' is used instead.  You can set it with: >
        	:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
        <	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
        an empty file.
        The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
        (Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
        by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
        An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
        because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
        accepted.
        The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
        environment.  It is useful when your environment uses a non-latin1
        encoding, such as Russian.
        When a file contains an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence it won't be
        recognized as "utf-8".  You can use the |8g8| command to find the
        illegal byte sequence.
        WRONG VALUES:			WHAT'S WRONG:
        	latin1,utf-8		"latin1" will always be used
        	utf-8,ucs-bom,latin1	BOM won't be recognized in an utf-8
        				file
        	cp1250,latin1		"cp1250" will always be used
        If 'fileencodings' is empty, 'fileencoding' is not modified.
        See 'fileencoding' for the possible values.
        Setting this option does not have an effect until the next time a file
        is read.

        This gives the end-of-line (<EOL>) formats that will be tried when
        starting to edit a new buffer and when reading a file into an existing
        buffer:
        - When empty, the format defined with 'fileformat' will be used
          always.  It is not set automatically.
        - When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
          is opened.  'fileformat' is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
          'fileformats' name will be used when a file is read into an existing
          buffer, no matter what 'fileformat' for that buffer is set to.
        - When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
          <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
          edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
          1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and 'fileformats' includes "dos",
             'fileformat' is set to "dos".
          2. If a <NL> is found and 'fileformats' includes "unix", 'fileformat'
             is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
             preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
          3. If 'fileformat' has not yet been set, and if a <CR> is found, and
             if 'fileformats' includes "mac", 'fileformat' is set to "mac".
             This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
              "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
              "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.
             Except: if "unix" was chosen, but there is a <CR> before
             the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
             the first few lines, "mac" is used.
          4. If 'fileformat' is still not set, the first name from
             'fileformats' is used.
          When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
          this happens like 'fileformat' has been set appropriately for that
          file only, the option is not changed.
        When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformats' is not used.

        When Vim starts up with an empty buffer the first item is used.  You
        can overrule this by setting 'fileformat' in your .vimrc.

        For systems with a Dos-like <EOL> (<CR><NL>), when reading files that
        are ":source"ed and for vimrc files, automatic <EOL> detection may be
        done:
        - When 'fileformats' is empty, there is no automatic detection.  Dos
          format will be used.
        - When 'fileformats' is set to one or more names, automatic detection
          is done.  This is based on the first <NL> in the file: If there is a
          <CR> in front of it, Dos format is used, otherwise Unix format is
          used.

        name.
        Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current file type.
        This option is normally set when the file type is detected.  To enable
        this use the ":filetype on" command. |:filetype|
        Setting this option to a different value is most useful in a modeline,
        for a file for which the file type is not automatically recognized.
        Example, for in an IDL file: >
        	/* vim: set filetype=idl : */
        <	|FileType| |filetypes|
        When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
        names.  Example: >
        	/* vim: set filetype=c.doxygen : */
        <	This will use the "c" filetype first, then the "doxygen" filetype.
        This works both for filetype plugins and for syntax files.  More than
        one dot may appear.
        This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the 's' or
        'S' flag in 'cpoptions'.
        Only normal file name characters can be used, `/\*?[|<>` are illegal.

        Any one that is omitted will fall back to the default.  For "stl" and
        "stlnc" the space will be used when there is highlighting, '^' or '='
        otherwise.

        Note that "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown", "vertleft", "vertright" and
        "verthoriz" are only used when 'laststatus' is 3, since only vertical
        window separators are used otherwise.

        If 'ambiwidth' is "double" then "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown",
        "vert", "vertleft", "vertright", "verthoriz", "foldsep" and "fold"
        default to single-byte alternatives.

        Example: >
            :set fillchars=stl:^,stlnc:=,vert:│,fold:·,diff:-
        <	This is similar to the default, except that these characters will also
        be used when there is highlighting.

        For the "stl", "stlnc", "foldopen", "foldclose" and "foldsep" items
        single-byte and multibyte characters are supported.  But double-width
        characters are not supported.

        Expression which is evaluated to format a range of lines for the |gq|

        The |v:lnum|  variable holds the first line to be formatted.
        The |v:count| variable holds the number of lines to be formatted.
        The |v:char|  variable holds the character that is going to be

        The expression is also evaluated when 'textwidth' is set and adding
        text beyond that limit.  This happens under the same conditions as
        when internal formatting is used.  Make sure the cursor is kept in the
        same spot relative to the text then!  The |mode()| function will
        return "i" or "R" in this situation.

        When the expression evaluates to non-zero Vim will fall back to using

        The argument-list is a dash separated list of these arguments:
        	hor{N}	horizontal bar, {N} percent of the character height
        	ver{N}	vertical bar, {N} percent of the character width
        	block	block cursor, fills the whole character

        		the numbers is zero, there is no blinking. E.g.: >

        <			- Default is "blinkon0" for each mode.

           n-c-v:block-nCursor	In Normal, Command-line and Visual mode, use a
        			block cursor with colors from the "nCursor"
        			highlight group
           n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25-Cursor,r-cr-o:hor20
        			In Normal et al. modes, use a block cursor
        			with the default colors defined by the host
        			terminal.  In Insert-likes modes, use
        			a vertical bar cursor with colors from
        			"Cursor" highlight group.  In Replace-likes
        			modes, use a underline cursor with
        			default colors.
           i-ci:ver30-iCursor-blinkwait300-blinkon200-blinkoff150
        			In Insert and Command-line Insert mode, use a
        			30% vertical bar cursor with colors from the
        			"iCursor" highlight group.  Blink a bit
        			faster.

        The 'a' mode is different.  It will set the given argument-list for
        all modes.  It does not reset anything to defaults.  This can be used
        to do a common setting for all modes.  For example, to switch off
        blinking: "a:blinkon0"

        This is a list of fonts which will be used for the GUI version of Vim.
        In its simplest form the value is just one font name.  When
        the font cannot be found you will get an error message.  To try other
        font names a list can be specified, font names separated with commas.
        The first valid font is used.

        Spaces after a comma are ignored.  To include a comma in a font name
        precede it with a backslash.  Setting an option requires an extra
        backslash before a space and a backslash.  See also
        |option-backslash|.  For example: >
            :set guifont=Screen15,\ 7x13,font\\,with\\,commas
        <	will make Vim try to use the font "Screen15" first, and if it fails it
        will try to use "7x13" and then "font,with,commas" instead.

        If none of the fonts can be loaded, Vim will keep the current setting.
        If an empty font list is given, Vim will try using other resource
        settings (for X, it will use the Vim.font resource), and finally it
        will try some builtin default which should always be there ("7x13" in
        the case of X).  The font names given should be "normal" fonts.  Vim
        will try to find the related bold and italic fonts.

        For Win32 and Mac OS: >
            :set guifont=*
        <	will bring up a font requester, where you can pick the font you want.

        The font name depends on the GUI used.

        For Mac OSX you can use something like this: >
            :set guifont=Monaco:h10
        <								*E236*
        Note that the fonts must be mono-spaced (all characters have the same
        width).

        To preview a font on X11, you might be able to use the "xfontsel"
        program.  The "xlsfonts" program gives a list of all available fonts.

        For the Win32 GUI					*E244* *E245*
        - takes these options in the font name:
        	hXX - height is XX (points, can be floating-point)
        	wXX - width is XX (points, can be floating-point)
        	b   - bold
        	i   - italic
        	u   - underline
        	s   - strikeout
        	cXX - character set XX.  Valid charsets are: ANSI, ARABIC,
        	      BALTIC, CHINESEBIG5, DEFAULT, EASTEUROPE, GB2312, GREEK,
        	      HANGEUL, HEBREW, JOHAB, MAC, OEM, RUSSIAN, SHIFTJIS,
        	      SYMBOL, THAI, TURKISH, VIETNAMESE ANSI and BALTIC.
        	      Normally you would use "cDEFAULT".

          Use a ':' to separate the options.
        - A '_' can be used in the place of a space, so you don't need to use
          backslashes to escape the spaces.

        This option only has an effect in the GUI version of Vim.  It is a
        sequence of letters which describes what components and options of the
        GUI should be used.
        To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
        "+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.

        Valid letters are as follows:
        						*guioptions_a* *'go-a'*
          'a'	Autoselect:  If present, then whenever VISUAL mode is started,
        	or the Visual area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of
        	the windowing system's global selection.  This means that the
        	Visually highlighted text is available for pasting into other
        	applications as well as into Vim itself.  When the Visual mode
        	ends, possibly due to an operation on the text, or when an
        	application wants to paste the selection, the highlighted text
        	is automatically yanked into the "* selection register.
        	Thus the selection is still available for pasting into other
        	applications after the VISUAL mode has ended.
        	    If not present, then Vim won't become the owner of the
        	windowing system's global selection unless explicitly told to
        	by a yank or delete operation for the "* register.
        	The same applies to the modeless selection.
        							*'go-P'*
          'P'	Like autoselect but using the "+ register instead of the "*
        	register.
        							*'go-A'*
          'A'	Autoselect for the modeless selection.  Like 'a', but only
        	applies to the modeless selection.

        	    'guioptions'   autoselect Visual  autoselect modeless ~
        		 ""		 -			 -
        		 "a"		yes			yes
        		 "A"		 -			yes
        		 "aA"		yes			yes

        							*'go-c'*
          'c'	Use console dialogs instead of popup dialogs for simple
        	choices.
        							*'go-d'*
          'd'	Use dark theme variant if available.
        							*'go-e'*
          'e'	Add tab pages when indicated with 'showtabline'.
        	'guitablabel' can be used to change the text in the labels.
        	When 'e' is missing a non-GUI tab pages line may be used.
        	The GUI tabs are only supported on some systems, currently
        	Mac OS/X and MS-Windows.
        							*'go-i'*
          'i'	Use a Vim icon.
        							*'go-m'*
          'm'	Menu bar is present.
        							*'go-M'*
          'M'	The system menu "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim" is not sourced.  Note
        	that this flag must be added in the vimrc file, before
        	switching on syntax or filetype recognition (when the |gvimrc|
        	file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded; the
        	`:syntax on` and `:filetype on` commands load the menu too).
        							*'go-g'*
          'g'	Grey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.  If
        	'g' is not included inactive menu items are not shown at all.
        							*'go-T'*
          'T'	Include Toolbar.  Currently only in Win32 GUI.
        							*'go-r'*
          'r'	Right-hand scrollbar is always present.
        							*'go-R'*
          'R'	Right-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
        	split window.
        							*'go-l'*
          'l'	Left-hand scrollbar is always present.
        							*'go-L'*
          'L'	Left-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
        	split window.
        							*'go-b'*
          'b'	Bottom (horizontal) scrollbar is present.  Its size depends on
        	the longest visible line, or on the cursor line if the 'h'
        	flag is included. |gui-horiz-scroll|
        							*'go-h'*
          'h'	Limit horizontal scrollbar size to the length of the cursor
        	line.  Reduces computations. |gui-horiz-scroll|

        And yes, you may even have scrollbars on the left AND the right if
        you really want to :-).  See |gui-scrollbars| for more information.

        							*'go-v'*
          'v'	Use a vertical button layout for dialogs.  When not included,
        	a horizontal layout is preferred, but when it doesn't fit a
        	vertical layout is used anyway.  Not supported in GTK 3.
        							*'go-p'*
          'p'	Use Pointer callbacks for X11 GUI.  This is required for some
        	window managers.  If the cursor is not blinking or hollow at
        	the right moment, try adding this flag.  This must be done
        	before starting the GUI.  Set it in your |gvimrc|.  Adding or
        	removing it after the GUI has started has no effect.
        							*'go-k'*
          'k'	Keep the GUI window size when adding/removing a scrollbar, or
        	toolbar, tabline, etc.  Instead, the behavior is similar to
        	when the window is maximized and will adjust 'lines' and
        	'columns' to fit to the window.  Without the 'k' flag Vim will
        	try to keep 'lines' and 'columns' the same when adding and
        	removing GUI components.

        While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed

        still need to finish the search command with <Enter> to move the

        Vim only searches for about half a second.  With a complicated
        pattern and/or a lot of text the match may not be found.  This is to
        avoid that Vim hangs while you are typing the pattern.
        The |hl-IncSearch| highlight group determines the highlighting.
        When 'hlsearch' is on, all matched strings are highlighted too while
        typing a search command. See also: 'hlsearch'.
        If you don't want to turn 'hlsearch' on, but want to highlight all
        matches while searching, you can turn on and off 'hlsearch' with
        autocmd.  Example: >

        It is used when a new line is created, for the |=| operator and

        'smartindent' indenting.  When 'lisp' is set, this option is

        The expression is evaluated with |v:lnum| set to the line number for
        which the indent is to be computed.  The cursor is also in this line
        when the expression is evaluated (but it may be moved around).

        If the expression starts with s: or |<SID>|, then it is replaced with

        where the option was set, thus script-local items are available.

        The expression must return the number of spaces worth of indent.  It
        can return "-1" to keep the current indent (this means 'autoindent' is
        used for the indent).
        Functions useful for computing the indent are |indent()|, |cindent()|

        The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!  It must
        not change the text, jump to another window, etc.  Afterwards the
        cursor position is always restored, thus the cursor may be moved.

        The characters specified by this option are included in file names and
        path names.  Filenames are used for commands like "gf", "[i" and in
        the tags file.  It is also used for "\f" in a |pattern|.
        Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
        characters up to 255 are specified with this option.
        For UTF-8 the characters 0xa0 to 0xff are included as well.
        Think twice before adding white space to this option.  Although a
        space may appear inside a file name, the effect will be that Vim
        doesn't know where a file name starts or ends when doing completion.
        It most likely works better without a space in 'isfname'.

        Note that on systems using a backslash as path separator, Vim tries to
        do its best to make it work as you would expect.  That is a bit
        tricky, since Vi originally used the backslash to escape special
        characters.  Vim will not remove a backslash in front of a normal file
        name character on these systems, but it will on Unix and alikes.  The
        '&' and '^' are not included by default, because these are special for
        cmd.exe.

        The format of this option is a list of parts, separated with commas.
        Each part can be a single character number or a range.  A range is two
        character numbers with '-' in between.  A character number can be a
        decimal number between 0 and 255 or the ASCII character itself (does
        not work for digits).  Example:
        	"_,-,128-140,#-43"	(include '_' and '-' and the range
        				128 to 140 and '#' to 43)
        If a part starts with '^', the following character number or range
        will be excluded from the option.  The option is interpreted from left
        to right.  Put the excluded character after the range where it is
        included.  To include '^' itself use it as the last character of the
        option or the end of a range.  Example:
        	"^a-z,#,^"	(exclude 'a' to 'z', include '#' and '^')
        If the character is '@', all characters where isalpha() returns TRUE
        are included.  Normally these are the characters a to z and A to Z,
        plus accented characters.  To include '@' itself use "@-@".  Examples:
        	"@,^a-z"	All alphabetic characters, excluding lower
        			case ASCII letters.
        	"a-z,A-Z,@-@"	All letters plus the '@' character.
        A comma can be included by using it where a character number is
        expected.  Example:
        	"48-57,,,_"	Digits, comma and underscore.
        A comma can be excluded by prepending a '^'.  Example:
        	" -~,^,,9"	All characters from space to '~', excluding
        			comma, plus <Tab>.
        See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

        This option allows switching your keyboard into a special language
        mode.  When you are typing text in Insert mode the characters are
        inserted directly.  When in Normal mode the 'langmap' option takes
        care of translating these special characters to the original meaning
        of the key.  This means you don't have to change the keyboard mode to
        be able to execute Normal mode commands.
        This is the opposite of the 'keymap' option, where characters are
        mapped in Insert mode.
        Also consider setting 'langremap' to off, to prevent 'langmap' from
        applying to characters resulting from a mapping.
        This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
        security reasons.

        Example (for Greek, in UTF-8):				*greek*  >
            :set langmap=ΑA,ΒB,ΨC,ΔD,ΕE,ΦF,ΓG,ΗH,ΙI,ΞJ,ΚK,ΛL,ΜM,ΝN,ΟO,ΠP,QQ,ΡR,ΣS,ΤT,ΘU,ΩV,WW,ΧX,ΥY,ΖZ,αa,βb,ψc,δd,εe,φf,γg,ηh,ιi,ξj,κk,λl,μm,νn,οo,πp,qq,ρr,σs,τt,θu,ωv,ςw,χx,υy,ζz

            :set langmap=zy,yz,ZY,YZ
        <
        The 'langmap' option is a list of parts, separated with commas.  Each
        part can be in one of two forms:
        1.  A list of pairs.  Each pair is a "from" character immediately
            followed by the "to" character.  Examples: "aA", "aAbBcC".
        2.  A list of "from" characters, a semi-colon and a list of "to"
            characters.  Example: "abc;ABC"
        Example: "aA,fgh;FGH,cCdDeE"
        Special characters need to be preceded with a backslash.  These are
        ";", ',', '"', '|' and backslash itself.

        This will allow you to activate vim actions without having to switch
        back and forth between the languages.  Your language characters will
        be understood as normal vim English characters (according to the
        langmap mappings) in the following cases:
         o Normal/Visual mode (commands, buffer/register names, user mappings)
         o Insert/Replace Mode: Register names after CTRL-R
         o Insert/Replace Mode: Mappings
        Characters entered in Command-line mode will NOT be affected by
        this option.   Note that this option can be changed at any time
        allowing to switch between mappings for different languages/encodings.
        Use a mapping to avoid having to type it each time!

        		"multispace" settings for trailing spaces.
        						*lcs-extends*
          extends:c	Character to show in the last column, when 'wrap' is
        		off and the line continues beyond the right of the
        		screen.
        						*lcs-precedes*

        		physical line, when there is text preceding the
        		character visible in the first column.
        						*lcs-conceal*
          conceal:c	Character to show in place of concealed text, when
        		'conceallevel' is set to 1.  A space when omitted.
        						*lcs-nbsp*
          nbsp:c	Character to show for a non-breakable space character
        		(0xA0 (160 decimal) and U+202F).  Left blank when

        The maximum value is about 2000000.  Use this to work without a limit.
        						*E363*
        When Vim runs into the limit it gives an error message and mostly
        behaves like CTRL-C was typed.
        Running into the limit often means that the pattern is very
        inefficient or too complex.  This may already happen with the pattern
        "\(.\)*" on a very long line.  ".*" works much better.
        Might also happen on redraw, when syntax rules try to match a complex
        text structure.
        Vim may run out of memory before hitting the 'maxmempattern' limit, in
        which case you get an "Out of memory" error instead.

        Parameters for |:mkspell|.  This tunes when to start compressing the
        word tree.  Compression can be slow when there are many words, but
        it's needed to avoid running out of memory.  The amount of memory used
        per word depends very much on how similar the words are, that's why
        this tuning is complicated.

        There are three numbers, separated by commas: >
        	{start},{inc},{added}
        <
        For most languages the uncompressed word tree fits in memory.  {start}
        gives the amount of memory in Kbyte that can be used before any
        compression is done.  It should be a bit smaller than the amount of
        memory that is available to Vim.

        When going over the {start} limit the {inc} number specifies the
        amount of memory in Kbyte that can be allocated before another
        compression is done.  A low number means compression is done after
        less words are added, which is slow.  A high number means more memory
        will be allocated.

        After doing compression, {added} times 1024 words can be added before
        the {inc} limit is ignored and compression is done when any extra
        amount of memory is needed.  A low number means there is a smaller
        chance of hitting the {inc} limit, less memory is used but it's
        slower.

        The languages for which these numbers are important are Italian and
        Hungarian.  The default works for when you have about 512 Mbyte.  If
        you have 1 Gbyte you could use: >
        	:set mkspellmem=900000,3000,800
        <	If you have less than 512 Mbyte |:mkspell| may fail for some
        languages, no matter what you set 'mkspellmem' to.

        To temporarily disable mouse support, hold the shift key while using

        works with operators too, e.g. type |d| then left-click to delete text
        from the current cursor position to the position where you clicked.

        Drag the |status-line| or vertical separator of a window to resize it.

        If enabled for "v" (Visual mode) then double-click selects word-wise,
        triple-click makes it line-wise, and quadruple-click makes it
        rectangular block-wise.

        Sets the model to use for the mouse.  The name mostly specifies what

           extend	Right mouse button extends a selection.  This works
        		like in an xterm.
           popup	Right mouse button pops up a menu.  The shifted left
        		mouse button extends a selection.  This works like
        		with Microsoft Windows.
           popup_setpos Like "popup", but the cursor will be moved to the
        		position where the mouse was clicked, and thus the
        		selected operation will act upon the clicked object.
        		If clicking inside a selection, that selection will
        		be acted upon, i.e. no cursor move.  This implies of
        		course, that right clicking outside a selection will
        		end Visual mode.
        Overview of what button does what for each model:
        mouse		    extend		popup(_setpos) ~
        left click	    place cursor	place cursor
        left drag	    start selection	start selection
        shift-left	    search word		extend selection
        right click	    extend selection	popup menu (place cursor)
        right drag	    extend selection	-
        middle click	    paste		paste

        In the "popup" model the right mouse button produces a pop-up menu.
        Nvim creates a default |popup-menu| but you can redefine it.

        Note that you can further refine the meaning of buttons with mappings.
        See |mouse-overview|.  But mappings are NOT used for modeless selection.

        octal	If included, numbers that start with a zero will be considered
        	to be octal.  Example: Using CTRL-A on "007" results in "010".
        hex	If included, numbers starting with "0x" or "0X" will be
        	considered to be hexadecimal.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
        	"0x100" results in "0x0ff".
        bin	If included, numbers starting with "0b" or "0B" will be
        	considered to be binary.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
        	"0b1000" subtracts one, resulting in "0b0111".
        unsigned    If included, numbers are recognized as unsigned. Thus a
        	leading dash or negative sign won't be considered as part of
        	the number.  Examples:
        	    Using CTRL-X on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2019"
        	    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2021").
        	    Using CTRL-A on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2021"
        	    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2019").
        	    Using CTRL-X on "0" or CTRL-A on "18446744073709551615"
        	    (2^64 - 1) has no effect, overflow is prevented.
        Numbers which simply begin with a digit in the range 1-9 are always
        considered decimal.  This also happens for numbers that are not
        recognized as octal or hex.

        - Use commas to separate directory names: >

          backslash: >

        <	- To search relative to the directory of the current file, use: >

        <	- To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
          commas: >
        	:set path=,,
        <	- A directory name may end in a ':' or '/'.
        - Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
        - When using |netrw.vim| URLs can be used.  For example, adding
          "https://www.vim.org" will make ":find index.html" work.
        - Search upwards and downwards in a directory tree using "*", "**" and
          ";".  See |file-searching| for info and syntax.
        - Careful with '\' characters, type two to get one in the option: >
        	:set path=.,c:\\include
        <	  Or just use '/' instead: >
        	:set path=.,c:/include
        <	Don't forget "." or files won't even be found in the same directory as
        the file!
        The maximum length is limited.  How much depends on the system, mostly
        it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.
        You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of

        The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing

        <	To add the current directory use: >
        	:set path+=
        <	To use an environment variable, you probably need to replace the

        	:let &path = &path .. "," .. substitute($INCL, ';', ',', 'g')

        Flags to change the way redrawing works, for debugging purposes.
        Most useful with 'writedelay' set to some reasonable value.
        Supports the following flags:
            compositor	Indicate each redraw event handled by the compositor
        		by briefly flashing the redrawn regions in colors
        		indicating the redraw type. These are the highlight
        		groups used (and their default colors):
        	RedrawDebugNormal   gui=reverse   normal redraw passed through
        	RedrawDebugClear    guibg=Yellow  clear event passed through
        	RedrawDebugComposed guibg=Green   redraw event modified by the
        					  compositor (due to
        					  overlapping grids, etc)
        	RedrawDebugRecompose guibg=Red    redraw generated by the
        					  compositor itself, due to a
        					  grid being moved or deleted.
            line	introduce a delay after each line drawn on the screen.
        		When using the TUI or another single-grid UI, "compositor"
        		gives more information and should be preferred (every
        		line is processed as a separate event by the compositor)
            flush	introduce a delay after each "flush" event.
            nothrottle	Turn off throttling of the message grid. This is an
        		optimization that joins many small scrolls to one
        		larger scroll when drawing the message area (with
        		'display' msgsep flag active).
            invalid	Enable stricter checking (abort) of inconsistencies
        		of the internal screen state. This is mostly
        		useful when running nvim inside a debugger (and
        		the test suite).
            nodelta	Send all internally redrawn cells to the UI, even if
        		they are unchanged from the already displayed state.

        Using automatic selection enables Vim to switch the engine, if the
        default engine becomes too costly.  E.g., when the NFA engine uses too
        many states.  This should prevent Vim from hanging on a combination of
        a complex pattern with long text.

        Show the line number relative to the line with the cursor in front of

        having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with
        other commands (e.g. y d c < > gq gw =).
        When the 'n' option is excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped
        line will not use the column of line numbers.

        Defaults are setup to search these locations:
        1. Your home directory, for personal preferences.
           Given by `stdpath("config")`.  |$XDG_CONFIG_HOME|
        2. Directories which must contain configuration files according to
           |xdg| ($XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, defaults to /etc/xdg).  This also contains
           preferences from system administrator.
        3. Data home directory, for plugins installed by user.
           Given by `stdpath("data")/site`.  |$XDG_DATA_HOME|
        4. nvim/site subdirectories for each directory in $XDG_DATA_DIRS.
           This is for plugins which were installed by system administrator,
           but are not part of the Nvim distribution. XDG_DATA_DIRS defaults
           to /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/, so system administrators are
           expected to install site plugins to /usr/share/nvim/site.
        5. Session state directory, for state data such as swap, backupdir,
           viewdir, undodir, etc.
           Given by `stdpath("state")`.  |$XDG_STATE_HOME|
        6. $VIMRUNTIME, for files distributed with Nvim.
        						*after-directory*
        7, 8, 9, 10. In after/ subdirectories of 1, 2, 3 and 4, with reverse
           ordering.  This is for preferences to overrule or add to the
           distributed defaults or system-wide settings (rarely needed).

        						*packages-runtimepath*
        "start" packages will also be searched (|runtime-search-path|) for
        runtime files after these, though such packages are not explicitly
        reported in &runtimepath. But "opt" packages are explicitly added to
        &runtimepath by |:packadd|.

        Note that, unlike 'path', no wildcards like "**" are allowed.  Normal
        wildcards are allowed, but can significantly slow down searching for
        runtime files.  For speed, use as few items as possible and avoid
        wildcards.
        See |:runtime|.
        Example: >
        	:set runtimepath=~/vimruntime,/mygroup/vim,$VIMRUNTIME
        <	This will use the directory "~/vimruntime" first (containing your
        personal Nvim runtime files), then "/mygroup/vim", and finally
        "$VIMRUNTIME" (the default runtime files).

        This is a comma-separated list of words that specifies how
        'scrollbind' windows should behave.  'sbo' stands for ScrollBind
        Options.
        The following words are available:
            ver		Bind vertical scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
            hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
            jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
        		scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
        		displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
        		around in a window, another 'scrollbind' window may
        		reach a position before the start or after the end of
        		the buffer.  The offset is not changed though, when
        		moving back the 'scrollbind' window will try to scroll
        		to the desired position when possible.
        		When now making that window the current one, two
        		things can be done with the relative offset:
        		1. When "jump" is not included, the relative offset is
        		   adjusted for the scroll position in the new current
        		   window.  When going back to the other window, the
        		   new relative offset will be used.
        		2. When "jump" is included, the other windows are
        		   scrolled to keep the same relative offset.  When
        		   going back to the other window, it still uses the
        		   same relative offset.
        Also see |scroll-binding|.
        When 'diff' mode is active there always is vertical scroll binding,
        even when "ver" isn't there.

        When non-empty, the shada file is read upon startup and written
        when exiting Vim (see |shada-file|).  The string should be a comma-
        separated list of parameters, each consisting of a single character
        identifying the particular parameter, followed by a number or string
        which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
        character is left out, then the default value is used for that
        parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
        the effect of their value.
        CHAR	VALUE	~
        						*shada-!*
        !	When included, save and restore global variables that start
        	with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
        	letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
        	and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
        	read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
        						*shada-quote*
        "	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
        	the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
        	backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
        	start of a comment!
        						*shada-%*
        %	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
        	started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
        	restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
        	buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
        	('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
        	removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
        	When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
        	number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
        	buffers are stored.
        						*shada-'*
        '	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
        	are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
        	'shada' is non-empty.
        	Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
        	|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
        						*shada-/*
        /	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
        	saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
        	patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
        	'history' is used.
        						*shada-:*
        :	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
        	saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
        						*shada-<*
        \<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
        	registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
        	saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
        	Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in KiB.
        						*shada-@*
        @	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
        	saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
        						*shada-c*
        c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
        	effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and 'encoding' value is fixed
        	to UTF-8 as well.
        						*shada-f*
        f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
        	to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
        	non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
        	cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
        						*shada-h*
        h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the shada
        	file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
        	has been used since the last search command.
        						*shada-n*
        n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
        	the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
        	'shadafile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
        	given here with 'shada'.  Environment variables are
        	expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
        						*shada-r*
        r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
        	',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
        	specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
        	stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
        	could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
        	e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
        						*shada-s*
        s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
        	is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
        	the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
        	unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
        	(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
        	integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
        	2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
        	contents size) = 10253 bytes.

        Example: >
            :set shada='50,<1000,s100,:0,n~/nvim/shada
        <
        '50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
        		edited.
        <1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
        		remembered.
        s100		Items with contents occupying more then 100 KiB are
        		skipped.
        :0		Command-line history will not be saved.
        n~/nvim/shada	The name of the file to use is "~/nvim/shada".
        no /		Since '/' is not specified, the default will be used,
        		that is, save all of the search history, and also the
        		previous search and substitute patterns.
        no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.
        no h		'hlsearch' highlighting will be restored.

        When setting 'shada' from an empty value you can use |:rshada| to
        load the contents of the file, this is not done automatically.

        Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.

        If the name of the shell contains a space, you need to enclose it in

        						*shell-unquoting*
        Rules regarding quotes:
        1. Option is split on space and tab characters that are not inside
           quotes: "abc def" runs shell named "abc" with additional argument
           "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional
           arguments (here and below: additional means “additional to
           'shellcmdflag'”).
        2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number:
           '"abc"', '"a"bc', 'a"b"c', 'ab"c"' and '"a"b"c"' are all equivalent
           to just "abc".
        3. Inside quotes backslash preceding backslash means one backslash.
           Backslash preceding quote means one quote. Backslash preceding
           anything else means backslash and next character literally:
           '"a\\b"' is the same as "a\b", '"a\\"b"' runs shell named literally
           'a"b', '"a\b"' is the same as "a\b" again.
        4. Outside of quotes backslash always means itself, it cannot be used
           to escape quote: 'a\"b"' is the same as "a\b".
        Note that such processing is done after |:set| did its own round of
        unescaping, so to keep yourself sane use |:let-&| like shown above.

        setting 'si' has no effect.  'indentexpr' is a more advanced
        alternative.
        Normally 'autoindent' should also be on when using 'smartindent'.
        An indent is automatically inserted:
        - After a line ending in "{".
        - After a line starting with a keyword from 'cinwords'.
        - Before a line starting with "}" (only with the "O" command).

        ignoring the region.

        Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
        name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
        'spellfile' is set to it, for entries in 'spelllang' only files

        A comma-separated list of word list names.  When the 'spell' option is

        	set spelllang=en_us,nl,medical
        <	This means US English, Dutch and medical words are recognized.  Words
        that are not recognized will be highlighted.
        The word list name must consist of alphanumeric characters, a dash or
        an underscore.  It should not include a comma or dot.  Using a dash is
        recommended to separate the two letter language name from a
        specification.  Thus "en-rare" is used for rare English words.
        A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
        the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
        region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
        English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
        Britain. (Note: currently en_au and en_nz dictionaries are older than
        en_ca, en_gb and en_us).
        If the name "cjk" is included East Asian characters are excluded from
        spell checking.  This is useful when editing text that also has Asian
        words.
        Note that the "medical" dictionary does not exist, it is just an
        example of a longer name.
        						*E757*
        As a special case the name of a .spl file can be given as-is.  The
        first "_xx" in the name is removed and used as the region name
        (_xx is an underscore, two letters and followed by a non-letter).
        This is mainly for testing purposes.  You must make sure the correct
        encoding is used, Vim doesn't check it.
        How the related spell files are found is explained here: |spell-load|.

        If the |spellfile.vim| plugin is active and you use a language name
        for which Vim cannot find the .spl file in 'runtimepath' the plugin
        will ask you if you want to download the file.

        After this option has been set successfully, Vim will source the files
        "spell/LANG.vim" in 'runtimepath'.  "LANG" is the value of 'spelllang'
        up to the first character that is not an ASCII letter or number and
        not a dash.  Also see |set-spc-auto|.

        Methods used for spelling suggestions.  Both for the |z=| command and

        items:

        best		Internal method that works best for English.  Finds
        		changes like "fast" and uses a bit of sound-a-like
        		scoring to improve the ordering.

        double		Internal method that uses two methods and mixes the
        		results.  The first method is "fast", the other method
        		computes how much the suggestion sounds like the bad
        		word.  That only works when the language specifies
        		sound folding.  Can be slow and doesn't always give
        		better results.

        fast		Internal method that only checks for simple changes:
        		character inserts/deletes/swaps.  Works well for
        		simple typing mistakes.

        {number}	The maximum number of suggestions listed for |z=|.
        		Not used for |spellsuggest()|.  The number of
        		suggestions is never more than the value of 'lines'
        		minus two.

        timeout:{millisec}   Limit the time searching for suggestions to
        		{millisec} milli seconds.  Applies to the following
        		methods.  When omitted the limit is 5000. When
        		negative there is no limit.

        file:{filename} Read file {filename}, which must have two columns,
        		separated by a slash.  The first column contains the
        		bad word, the second column the suggested good word.
        		Example:
        			theribal/terrible ~
        		Use this for common mistakes that do not appear at the
        		top of the suggestion list with the internal methods.
        		Lines without a slash are ignored, use this for
        		comments.
        		The word in the second column must be correct,
        		otherwise it will not be used.  Add the word to an
        		".add" file if it is currently flagged as a spelling
        		mistake.
        		The file is used for all languages.

        expr:{expr}	Evaluate expression {expr}.  Use a function to avoid
        		trouble with spaces.  |v:val| holds the badly spelled
        		word.  The expression must evaluate to a List of
        		Lists, each with a suggestion and a score.
        		Example:
        			[['the', 33], ['that', 44]] ~
        		Set 'verbose' and use |z=| to see the scores that the
        		internal methods use.  A lower score is better.
        		This may invoke |spellsuggest()| if you temporarily
        		set 'spellsuggest' to exclude the "expr:" part.
        		Errors are silently ignored, unless you set the
        		'verbose' option to a non-zero value.

        Only one of "best", "double" or "fast" may be used.  The others may
        appear several times in any order.  Example: >

        EXPERIMENTAL
        When non-empty, this option determines the content of the area to the
        side of a window, normally containing the fold, sign and number columns.
        The format of this option is like that of 'statusline'.

        Some of the items from the 'statusline' format are different for
        'statuscolumn':

        %l	line number of currently drawn line
        %r	relative line number of currently drawn line
        %s	sign column for currently drawn line
        %C	fold column for currently drawn line

        NOTE: To draw the sign and fold columns, their items must be included in
        'statuscolumn'. Even when they are not included, the status column width
        will adapt to the 'signcolumn' and 'foldcolumn' width.

        The |v:lnum|    variable holds the line number to be drawn.
        The |v:relnum|  variable holds the relative line number to be drawn.
        The |v:virtnum| variable is negative when drawing virtual lines, zero
        	      when drawing the actual buffer line, and positive when
        	      drawing the wrapped part of a buffer line.

        NOTE: The %@ click execute function item is supported as well but the
        specified function will be the same for each row in the same column.
        It cannot be switched out through a dynamic 'statuscolumn' format, the
        handler should be written with this in mind.

        Examples: >vim
        	" Relative number with bar separator and click handlers:
        	:set statuscolumn=%@SignCb@%s%=%T%@NumCb@%r│%T

        	" Right aligned relative cursor line number:
        	:let &stc='%=%{v:relnum?v:relnum:v:lnum} '

        	" Line numbers in hexadecimal for non wrapped part of lines:
        	:let &stc='%=%{v:virtnum>0?"":printf("%x",v:lnum)} '

        	" Human readable line numbers with thousands separator:
        	:let &stc='%{substitute(v:lnum,"\\d\\zs\\ze\\'
        		   . '%(\\d\\d\\d\\)\\+$",",","g")}'

        	" Both relative and absolute line numbers with different
        	" highlighting for odd and even relative numbers:
        	:let &stc='%#NonText#%{&nu?v:lnum:""}' .
        	 '%=%{&rnu&&(v:lnum%2)?"\ ".v:relnum:""}' .
        	 '%#LineNr#%{&rnu&&!(v:lnum%2)?"\ ".v:relnum:""}'

        an expensive expression can negatively affect render performance.

        When non-empty, this option determines the content of the status line.
        Also see |status-line|.

        The option consists of printf style '%' items interspersed with
        normal text.  Each status line item is of the form:
          %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
        All fields except the {item} are optional.  A single percent sign can
        be given as "%%".

        When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,
        evaluated and the result is used as the option value.  Example: >
        	:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
        <	The *g:statusline_winid* variable will be set to the |window-ID| of the
        window that the status line belongs to.
        The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
        Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the
        current window and buffer, while %{} items are evaluated in the
        context of the window that the statusline belongs to.

        When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
        empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.
        When the result contains unprintable characters the result is
        unpredictable.

        Note that the only effect of 'ruler' when this option is set (and
        'laststatus' is 2 or 3) is controlling the output of |CTRL-G|.

        field	    meaning ~
        -	    Left justify the item.  The default is right justified
        	    when minwid is larger than the length of the item.
        0	    Leading zeroes in numeric items.  Overridden by "-".
        minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by "-" & "0".
        	    Value must be 50 or less.
        maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a "<"

        P S   Percentage through file of displayed window.  This is like the
              percentage described for 'ruler'.  Always 3 in length, unless

              Note that there is no "%" before the closing "}".  The
              expression cannot contain a "}" character, call a function to
              work around that.  See |stl-%{| below.
        `{%` -  This is almost same as "{" except the result of the expression is
              re-evaluated as a statusline format string.  Thus if the
              return value of expr contains "%" items they will get expanded.
              The expression can contain the "}" character, the end of
              expression is denoted by "%}".

        	endfunc
        <	        `stl=%{Stl_filename()}`   results in `"%t"`
                `stl=%{%Stl_filename()%}` results in `"Name of current file"`
        %} -  End of "{%" expression
        ( -   Start of item group.  Can be used for setting the width and
              alignment of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
        ) -   End of item group.  No width fields allowed.
        T N   For 'tabline': start of tab page N label.  Use %T or %X to end
              the label.  Clicking this label with left mouse button switches
              to the specified tab page.
        X N   For 'tabline': start of close tab N label.  Use %X or %T to end
              the label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current
              tab" label.    Clicking this label with left mouse button closes
              specified tab page.
        @ N   Start of execute function label. Use %X or %T to
              end the label, e.g.: %10@SwitchBuffer@foo.c%X.  Clicking this
              label runs specified function: in the example when clicking once
              using left mouse button on "foo.c" "SwitchBuffer(10, 1, 'l',
              '    ')" expression will be run.  Function receives the
              following arguments in order:
              1. minwid field value or zero if no N was specified
              2. number of mouse clicks to detect multiple clicks
              3. mouse button used: "l", "r" or "m" for left, right or middle
                 button respectively; one should not rely on third argument
                 being only "l", "r" or "m": any other non-empty string value
                 that contains only ASCII lower case letters may be expected
                 for other mouse buttons
              4. modifiers pressed: string which contains "s" if shift
                 modifier was pressed, "c" for control, "a" for alt and "m"
                 for meta; currently if modifier is not pressed string
                 contains space instead, but one should not rely on presence
                 of spaces or specific order of modifiers: use |stridx()| to
                 test whether some modifier is present; string is guaranteed
                 to contain only ASCII letters and spaces, one letter per
                 modifier; "?" modifier may also be present, but its presence
                 is a bug that denotes that new mouse button recognition was
                 added without modifying code that reacts on mouse clicks on
                 this label.
              Use |getmousepos()|.winid in the specified function to get the
              corresponding window id of the clicked item.
        \< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
              No width fields allowed.
        = -   Separation point between alignment sections.  Each section will
              be separated by an equal number of spaces.  With one %= what
              comes after it will be right-aligned.  With two %= there is a
              middle part, with white space left and right of it.
              No width fields allowed.
        # -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
              Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
              highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
              windows.
        * -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
              minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
              The difference between User{N} and StatusLine will be applied to
              StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
              The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See |hl-User1..9|

        When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
        that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
        when flags are used like in the examples below.

        When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
        not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
        become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
        completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set. >
        	:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
        <	Beware that an expression is evaluated each and every time the status
        line is displayed.
        			*stl-%{* *g:actual_curbuf* *g:actual_curwin*
        While evaluating %{} the current buffer and current window will be set
        temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
        currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
        The variable "g:actual_curbuf" is set to the `bufnr()` number of the
        real current buffer and "g:actual_curwin" to the |window-ID| of the
        real current window.  These values are strings.

        The 'statusline' option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
        a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
        This option cannot be set in a modeline when 'modelineexpr' is off.

        It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
        evaluating 'statusline' |textlock|.

        If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
        a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
        using `:redrawstatus`.

        A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
        Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
        described above.

        Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
        If you are stuck, hold down ':' or 'Q' to get a prompt, then quit and
        edit your vimrc or whatever with "vim --clean" to get it right.

        Examples:
        Emulate standard status line with 'ruler' set >
          :set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P

        Files with these suffixes get a lower priority when multiple files

        line at the top of the Vim window.  When empty Vim will use a default

        The tab pages line only appears as specified with the 'showtabline'
        option and only when there is no GUI tab line.  When 'e' is in
        'guioptions' and the GUI supports a tab line 'guitablabel' is used

        the text to be displayed.  Use "%1T" for the first label, "%2T" for

        Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see

        Note: Setting 'tabstop' to any other value than 8 can make your file
        appear wrong in many places.
        The value must be more than 0 and less than 10000.

        There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:
        1. Always keep 'tabstop' at 8, set 'softtabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to 4
           (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use 'noexpandtab'.  Then Vim
           will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
           behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
           This is the recommended way, the file will look the same with other
           tools and when listing it in a terminal.
        2. Set 'softtabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use
           'expandtab'.  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
           formatting will never be messed up when 'tabstop' is changed (leave
           it at 8 just in case).  The file will be a bit larger.
           You do need to check if no Tabs exist in the file.  You can get rid
           of them by first setting 'expandtab' and using `%retab!`, making
           sure the value of 'tabstop' is set correctly.
        3. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use
           'expandtab'.  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
           formatting will never be messed up when 'tabstop' is changed.
           You do need to check if no Tabs exist in the file, just like in the
           item just above.
        4. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use a
           |modeline| to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
           works when using Vim to edit the file, other tools assume a tabstop
           is worth 8 spaces.
        5. Always set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to the same value, and
           'noexpandtab'.  This should then work (for initial indents only)
           for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
           tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
           though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when 'tabstop' is
           changed.

        The value of 'tabstop' will be ignored if |'vartabstop'| is set to
        anything other than an empty string.

        When searching for a tag (e.g., for the |:ta| command), Vim can either
        use a binary search or a linear search in a tags file.  Binary
        searching makes searching for a tag a LOT faster, but a linear search
        will find more tags if the tags file wasn't properly sorted.
        Vim normally assumes that your tags files are sorted, or indicate that
        they are not sorted.  Only when this is not the case does the
        'tagbsearch' option need to be switched off.

        When 'tagbsearch' is on, binary searching is first used in the tags
        files.  In certain situations, Vim will do a linear search instead for
        certain files, or retry all files with a linear search.  When
        'tagbsearch' is off, only a linear search is done.

        Linear searching is done anyway, for one file, when Vim finds a line
        at the start of the file indicating that it's not sorted: >
           !_TAG_FILE_SORTED	0	/some comment/
        <	[The whitespace before and after the '0' must be a single <Tab>]

        When a binary search was done and no match was found in any of the
        files listed in 'tags', and case is ignored or a pattern is used
        instead of a normal tag name, a retry is done with a linear search.
        Tags in unsorted tags files, and matches with different case will only
        be found in the retry.

        If a tag file indicates that it is case-fold sorted, the second,
        linear search can be avoided when case is ignored.  Use a value of '2'
        in the "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED" line for this.  A tag file can be case-fold
        sorted with the -f switch to "sort" in most unices, as in the command:
        "sort -f -o tags tags".  For Universal ctags and Exuberant ctags
        version 5.x or higher (at least 5.5) the --sort=foldcase switch can be
        used for this as well.  Note that case must be folded to uppercase for
        this to work.

        By default, tag searches are case-sensitive.  Case is ignored when
        'ignorecase' is set and 'tagcase' is "followic", or when 'tagcase' is
        "ignore".
        Also when 'tagcase' is "followscs" and 'smartcase' is set, or
        'tagcase' is "smart", and the pattern contains only lowercase
        characters.

        When 'tagbsearch' is off, tags searching is slower when a full match
        exists, but faster when no full match exists.  Tags in unsorted tags
        files may only be found with 'tagbsearch' off.
        When the tags file is not sorted, or sorted in a wrong way (not on
        ASCII byte value), 'tagbsearch' should be off, or the line given above
        must be included in the tags file.
        This option doesn't affect commands that find all matching tags (e.g.,
        command-line completion and ":help").

        contain wildcards, it is used as-is.  E.g., "/lib/**/tags?" will find
        files called "tags?".
        The |tagfiles()| function can be used to get a list of the file names

        A comma-separated list of these words:
            block	Allow virtual editing in Visual block mode.
            insert	Allow virtual editing in Insert mode.
            all		Allow virtual editing in all modes.
            onemore	Allow the cursor to move just past the end of the line
            none	When used as the local value, do not allow virtual
        		editing even when the global value is set.  When used
        		as the global value, "none" is the same as "".
            NONE	Alternative spelling of "none".

        Virtual editing means that the cursor can be positioned where there is
        no actual character.  This can be halfway into a tab or beyond the end
        of the line.  Useful for selecting a rectangle in Visual mode and
        editing a table.
        "onemore" is not the same, it will only allow moving the cursor just
        after the last character of the line.  This makes some commands more
        consistent.  Previously the cursor was always past the end of the line
        if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi compatible.  It may also
        break some plugins or Vim scripts.  For example because |l| can move
        the cursor after the last character.  Use with care!
        Using the `$` command will move to the last character in the line, not
        past it.  This may actually move the cursor to the left!
        The `g$` command will move to the end of the screen line.
        It doesn't make sense to combine "all" with "onemore", but you will
        not get a warning for it.
        When combined with other words, "none" is ignored.

        <	allows wrap only when cursor keys are used.
        When the movement keys are used in combination with a delete or change
        operator, the <EOL> also counts for a character.  This makes "3h"
        different from "3dh" when the cursor crosses the end of a line.  This
        is also true for "x" and "X", because they do the same as "dl" and
        "dh".  If you use this, you may also want to use the mapping
        ":map <BS> X" to make backspace delete the character in front of the
        cursor.
        When 'l' is included and it is used after an operator at the end of a
        line (not an empty line) then it will not move to the next line.  This
        makes "dl", "cl", "yl" etc. work normally.

        When 'wildmenu' is on, command-line completion operates in an enhanced
        mode.  On pressing 'wildchar' (usually <Tab>) to invoke completion,
        the possible matches are shown.
        When 'wildoptions' contains "pum", then the completion matches are
        shown in a popup menu.  Otherwise they are displayed just above the
        command line, with the first match highlighted (overwriting the status
        line, if there is one).
        Keys that show the previous/next match, such as <Tab> or
        CTRL-P/CTRL-N, cause the highlight to move to the appropriate match.
        'wildmode' must specify "full": "longest" and "list" do not start
        'wildmenu' mode. You can check the current mode with |wildmenumode()|.
        The menu is cancelled when a key is hit that is not used for selecting
        a completion.

        While the menu is active these keys have special meanings:

        CTRL-Y		- accept the currently selected match and stop
        		  completion.
        CTRL-E		- end completion, go back to what was there before
        		  selecting a match.
        <Left> <Right>	- select previous/next match (like CTRL-P/CTRL-N)
        <Down>		- in filename/menu name completion: move into a
        		  subdirectory or submenu.
        <CR>		- in menu completion, when the cursor is just after a
        		  dot: move into a submenu.
        <Up>		- in filename/menu name completion: move up into
        		  parent directory or parent menu.

        If you want <Left> and <Right> to move the cursor instead of selecting
        a different match, use this: >

        first part specifies the behavior for the first use of 'wildchar',
        The second part for the second use, etc.

        Each part consists of a colon separated list consisting of the
        following possible values:
        ""		Complete only the first match.
        "full"		Complete the next full match.  After the last match,
        		the original string is used and then the first match
        		again.  Will also start 'wildmenu' if it is enabled.
        "longest"	Complete till longest common string.  If this doesn't
        		result in a longer string, use the next part.
        "list"		When more than one match, list all matches.
        "lastused"	When completing buffer names and more than one buffer
        		matches, sort buffers by time last used (other than
        		the current buffer).
        When there is only a single match, it is fully completed in all cases.

        Examples of useful colon-separated values:
        "longest:full"	Like "longest", but also start 'wildmenu' if it is
        		enabled.  Will not complete to the next full match.
        "list:full"	When more than one match, list all matches and
        		complete first match.
        "list:longest"	When more than one match, list all matches and
        		complete till longest common string.
        "list:lastused" When more than one buffer matches, list all matches
        		and sort buffers by time last used (other than the
        		current buffer).

        Examples: >
        	:set wildmode=full
        <	Complete first full match, next match, etc.  (the default) >
        	:set wildmode=longest,full
        <	Complete longest common string, then each full match >
        	:set wildmode=list:full
        <	List all matches and complete each full match >
        	:set wildmode=list,full
        <	List all matches without completing, then each full match >
        	:set wildmode=longest,list

        that ":all" will create only two windows.  To avoid "vim -o 1 2 3 4"
        to create only two windows, set the option after startup is done,
        using the |VimEnter| event: >
        	au VimEnter * set winheight=999
        <	Minimum value is 1.
        The height is not adjusted after one of the commands that change the
        height of the current window.
