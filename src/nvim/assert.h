// as C11 but does support _Static_assert since 4.6. Since we prefer the
// clearer messages we get from _Static_assert, we suppress the warnings
// temporarily.

// the easiest case, when the mode is C11 (generic compiler) or Clang
// advertises explicit support for c_static_assert, meaning it won't warn.
