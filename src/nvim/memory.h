/// 1. Usually we want to know if truncation happened, not by how much.
///    Truncation happens when the `src` string is larger than the `dst` buffer.

/// 4. It saves one from having to manually type `if (strlen(str) > ...)`.

///
/// @code{.c}
///   if (xstrucpy(buf, str, bufsize, str_len) < str_len) {
///     // truncation happened, deal with it
