.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a text editor based on Vim.
To enter commands in
.Nm ,
type a colon
.Pq Sq \&:
which is also used in this manual to denote commands.
For more information, consult the online help system with the
.Ic :help
command.
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ar file ...
File(s) to edit.
If none are specified, open an empty buffer.
If multiple files are specified, open one buffer for each file.
To switch between buffers, use the
.Ic :next
and
.Ic :previous
commands.
.It Fl
Read text from standard input until
.Dv EOF ,
then open a buffer with that text.
Commands are read from standard error, which should be a terminal.
.It Fl t Ar tag
The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on a
tag, a sort of goto label.
.Ar tag
is looked up in the tags file, the associated file becomes the current
file and the associated command is executed.
If
.Ar tag
is a function name, the file containing that function is opened
with the cursor positioned at the start of the function.
See
.Ic :help tag-commands .
.It Fl q Op Ar errorfile
QuickFix mode.
Display the first error in
.Ar errorfile .
If
.Ar errorfile
is omitted, the value of the 'errorfile' option is used (defaults to
.Cm errors.err ) .
Further errors can be jumped to with the
.Ic :cnext
command.
See
.Ic :help quickfix .
.It There are a number of other options:
.It Fl -
Interpret all further arguments as files.
Can be used to edit files starting with a hyphen
.Pq Sq - .
.It Fl -literal
Interpret filenames literally, that is, do not expand wildcards.
Has no effect on Unix-like systems, where the shell expands wildcards.
.It Fl e
Ex mode.
See
.Ic :help Ex-mode .
.It Fl E
Improved Ex mode.
See
.Ic :help gQ .
.It Fl s
Silent mode.
Only takes effect if
.Fl e
or
.Fl E
is specified before it.
.It Fl d
Diff mode.
Show the difference between two to four files, similar to
.Xr sdiff 1 .
See
.Ic :help diff .
.It Fl R
Read-only mode.
Sets the option 'readonly'.
Implies
.Fl n .
Buffers can still be edited, but cannot be written to disk if already
associated with a file.
To overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the needed Ex command, such as
.Ic :w! .
See
.Ic :help 'readonly' .
.It Fl Z
Restricted mode.
Disable commands that make use of an external shell.
.It Fl m
Disable file modifications.
Unsets the option 'write'.

writing a ShaDa file.
.Ar N
is the value for the 'verbose' option; defaults to

is specified, append messages to
.Ar file
instead of printing them.
.It Fl D
Debugging mode.
Started when executing the first command from a script.
.It Fl n
Disable the use of swap files.
Sets the option 'updatecount' to
.Cm 0 .
Can be useful for editing file(s) on a slow medium.
.It Fl r Op Ar file
Recovery mode.
If
.Ar file
is omitted
then list swap files with recovery information.
Otherwise the swap file
.Ar file
is used to recover a crashed session.
The swap file has the same name as the file it's associated with, but with
.Sq .swp
appended.
See
.Ic :help recovery .
.It Fl L Op Ar file
Alias for
.Fl r .
.It Fl u Ar vimrc

.Ar linenum .
If
.Ar linenum
is omitted, position the cursor on the last line of the file.

and
.Cm -c 5
on the command-line are equivalent to
.Ic :5
inside
.Nm .
.It Cm +/ Ns Op Ar pattern

.Ar pattern .
If
.Ar pattern
is omitted, the most recently used search pattern is used (if there is one).

.Ic :/foo
inside
.Nm .
See
.Ic :help search-pattern .
.It Fl c Ar command

.Ar command
after reading the first file.
Up to 10 instances of

if found, is used.
See
.Ic :help session-file .

.Ic :source! scriptin .
If the end of the file is reached before
.Nm
exits, further characters are read from the keyboard.
.It Fl w Ar scriptout
Append all typed characters to
.Ar scriptout .
Can be used for creating a script to be used with
.Fl s
or
.Ic :source! .
.It Fl W Ar scriptout
