Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim in order to:

- Simplify maintenance and encourage [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Split the work between multiple developers
- Enable advanced [external UIs] without modifications to the core
- Improve extensibility with a new [plugin architecture](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Plugin-UI-architecture)

For more details, see
[the wiki](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Introduction)!
