Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim in order to:

- Simplify maintenance and encourage contributions
- Split the work between multiple developers
- Enable the implementation of new/modern user interfaces without any
  modifications to the core source
- Improve extensibility with a new plugin architecture

    Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
    encouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda.  Please see the
    kcc section of the vim docs or visit the ICCF web site, available at these URLs:

            http://iccf-holland.org/
            http://www.vim.org/iccf/
            http://www.iccf.nl/

    You can also sponsor the development of Vim.  Vim sponsors can vote for
    features.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.
