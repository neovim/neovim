        - Upload `lsp.log` before and after the problem in a [secret gist](https://gist.github.com/). Paste the URL to the gist.
        - You can set the log level by adding `vim.lsp.set_log_level("debug")` after setting up LSP in your config.
        - You can find the location of the log with `:lua print(vim.lsp.get_log_path())`
