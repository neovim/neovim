# Third party dependencies for neovim

This directory contains the recipes to build any third party dependencies for
neovim which, for one reason or another, we cannot rely on the system to supply.

Most of the details are captured in the `CMakeLists.txt`, but we have a
dedicated directory in case any of the dependencies requires patching and other
support.
